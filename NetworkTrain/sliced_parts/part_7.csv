"http://spackle.xidus.net/info.php>>From the website:
""Spackle is designed to be a flexible client/server architecture for the 
gathering and displaying of statistics, primarily suited to monitoring 
servers. It's written in PHP and bash shell script, uses RRDtool  for stats 
logging, and PostgreSQL for the server-side database. (soon to support MySQL 
as well)""I had this up and running within a few hours. The hardest bit was getting 
PostgreSQL running as it's been a few years since I used it. I had a bit of a 
problem getting it to work on rh6.2 boxes but I documented the changes here: 
http://xeer.blogspot.com/?/2002_07_01_xeer_archive.html#79148596Web interface is simple, but functional. It has a simple way of distributing 
the monitoring scripts (which could be compromised but I digress), and the 
resulting graphs are pretty!Donncha.--

"typological classification a few remarks on fritz newmeyer 's posting on classification in language typology : of course it is not always easy to decide to which type a given language should be assigned , since there may be conflicting criteria . but some people seem to think that this is somehow a deep problem with language typology . in reality , there is no deep problem here at all , so the typological literature is quite right in not dwelling on such trivial methodological points too much , concentrating on substantive and theoretical issues instead . true , the methodology of language typology is somewhat different from the methodology used in single-language studies that most linguists engange in . when searching for significant correlations between features / parameters in the world 's language , one has to classify languages , and the more languages one looks at , the less energy one can spend on resolving each individual case . clearly , the speacialist will sometimes disagree with the way her or his language was assigned , but then most of them time not all specialists agree on the right classification themselves . when the criteria are in conflict , it may sometimes be necessary to give more weight to some than to others in a somewhat arbitrary way - - but this is simply one reflection of the necessary idealization that accompanies any serious scientific endeavor . it 's as simple as that : the more one studies linguistic phenomena in breadth , the more one loses in depth . but vice versa , linguists that study only one or a few languages are working on an extremely narrow basis and lose in breadth what they gain in depth . ideally , typological research should be conducted by teams of linguists , much in the same way as research in big science is organized . with more resources that are combined , one could study linguistic phenomena in considerable breadth and depth simultaneously . an attempt to follow this strategy has been made in the european science programme in language typology , which has been running in europe for the past five years ( wait for 10 volumes on the typology of european languages , to appear with mouton de gruyter in a year 's time ) . this was only a very modest , seriously underfunded attempt , but until we attract really big research money or manage to agree on more things , we have to be happy that we have colleagues like johanna nichols who are willing to make enormous efforts to get a view of linguistic phenomena on a global scale . martin haspelmath ( free university of berlin )",Safe Email

your 
Web design skills? Get full-length books from the Poor Richard's 
series, including Poor Richard's E-mail Publishing, by Chris Pirillo, at GnomeTomes.com, for 50% off the suggested retail price of the print versions. 
Click here to learn more.    I'm now twice a published author. Earlier in the week, I released my  
top 50 Mac OS X tips, 
which marks the only thing I've ever written that I 
expect anyone to pay for. If you happen to use OS X, go check them out. 
My second publication is a PDF only explanation of the process for 
converting Vinyl LPs to CD, by way of your PC (how's that for alphabet 
soup). For the time being, you can get it absolutely free, with the 
caveat that I'd appreciate some feed back on what could be added to make 
it more useful (I'm considering some screen shots for it if I get some 
time). What are you waiting for -- 
get something free already.With the expiration of Lockergnome's old cell phone plan, Lori and I 
opted to make a switch to Verizon, at the recommendation of Brian 
Stevens. I'm already happy with the suggestion, as our previous provider 
had horrid customer service, not to mention I now have a much geekier 
phone in the form of the 
Kyocera QCP 6035 
Palm powered unit. It's just 
larger than most Palm devices on the market, but having the device 
integration is nice. It has all the functionality of a Palm, with some 
Internet browsing capabilities and of course, phone access. A built in 
speakerphone actually works better than I expected,  Now all I need to 
do is get more applications installed.Of interest to anyone who signed up for 
emusic after Chris and I talked 
the service up and down last week: It seems they've added in the ballpark 
of 1,000 Universal titles to their roster of offerings. Not surprising 
considering they're part of the same conglomerate, but still good news 
in terms of feature expansion.Jake LudingtonÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomePRODUCER
GIF Movie Gear v3.02 [1129k] W9X/NT/W2K/XP $40
http://www.moviegear.com/gmgdet.htm
The majority of GIF animation on the Web does absolutely nothing for 
me. I'm of the mindset that animation is meant to either tell a story 
or illustrate a concept -- not put something in motion just because 
you can. That said, for anyone wanting to create animations, this tool 
makes it nice and easy. A storyboard interface keeps you thinking like 
a movie maker as you build your animated creations, which lends itself 
to helping anyone who'd like to get from point A to point B in an 
orderly fashion. The software supports PSD, JPG, AVI, BMP, and GIF 
formats, leaving your options open for creating animated segments.Â GnomeFEATURE

more than it should about the lowest common denominator). A WMV capable player

Comedy - 93min
Reviewer's Tilt (2)
 
Two out of work rent-a-cops make an attempt to break into the music 
video industry in this quirky comedy. John Cusack and Tim Robbins 
make this comedy work, starring as the two security guards as they 
send up all sorts of Hollywood stereotypes. You can't help but laugh 
at the ridiculous predicaments these two survive, as they are 
greeted with cameos by a who's who of music and movie industry names. 
I'm sure neither Robbins nor Cusack would openly list this movie on a 
resume, but it is indeed a brilliant performance by both of them, 
especially as a demonstration of their ability to play off of each 
other. Although this is a late 80's release (one of the few 80's 
underground classics I hadn't previously seen), it remains relevant 
to those out there who are looking to put it to the man. If you've 
ever hated the recording industry and its in-crowd attitude, you'll 
love this film. A closing reference to Rene's Courtyard Cafe in Santa 
Monica, which is a regular stop for me every time I'm in the LA area, 
prompted me to want to watch the film for a second viewing. The movie 
is humorous enough for several viewings. Nothing really grabs attention 
on the DVD, but then again, the studio probably expects no one will buy 
it anyway.

supply estimates and several legal requirements and permissions . in fact , the committee has found that the mseb has been paying enron rs 930 crore more than it should every year . this comprises overcharging of rs 253 crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only 42 per cent of the capacity is used for dpc . there ' s also a rs 100 crore extra billing to the mseb for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of these facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge . by charging more than twice the operations & maintenance rate stipulated by the government of india , enron collects approximately rs 246 crore extra every year . it has also been collecting rs 332 crore every year through inflated fuel consumption claims . enron has been charging at 1878 kcal / kwh under the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed it a much lower consumption rate . this gives it a fat fuel arbitrage opportunity at the cost of the people of maharashtra . the committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four different exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation : a rate of rs 32 per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loans , rs 34 . 5 per dollar as reference rate for phase - i , rs 39 . 35 per dollar as reference rate for phase - ii and a curious rs 42 per dollar for calculating government of india tariff . forcing a reduction of these excessive charges has nothing to do with contract cancellation . all it needs is tough negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment . the godbole committee has established that dpc ' s tariffs can easily be halved if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the dollarisation of payments , the take - or - pay clause and escrow facility ( which is in fact hampering mseb ' s reform particularly in power distribution ) are scrapped . the security of future payments to dpc under the restructured tariff would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system . the committee also gives enron a difficult escape route . it says that if the multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous , it should free mseb from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside maharashtra . the committee has tried to establish another precedent on all projects negotiated by government : "" the public has a right to know what is being contracted on their behalf "" and has recommended that all documents , including contracts related to all independent power projects ( ipps ) , particularly dpc , should be published by the maharashtra government within two months . also , having established that demand - supply estimates by the state government were fanciful , the committee has asked mseb to defer all negotiations with power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such ipps . it recommends that such negotiations should be in accordance with the least - cost plan spelt out by the report . this should also end the hectic lobbying by reliance ( patalganga ) , mittals ( bhadravati ) , the bses ( saphale ) and others to set up ipps in maharashtra . - - -

in - fact "" and authorise him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts and financing agreements and their amendments and modifications . top sources told the financial express that dpc would authorise mr cline and / or mr mcgregor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to the state and central governments and mseb under clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa . "" in response to the continuing default by the mseb of its payment obligations under the ppa , the failure of the government of maharashtra to honour obligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of the government of india to honour obligations under its counter guarantee , the company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conciliation and arbitration proceedings , "" the company resolution said . "" consistent with this recourse to contractual remedies , the company now seeks the authority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices pursuant to clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa from time to time and at any time upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such notices as determined by the company , "" the resolution added . according to the resolution , the directors , the company secretary and officers of the company and each of them acting individually , are authorised and empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take such other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution , in the name and for and on behalf of the company . against this backdrop , the state government and mseb have been exploring the possibilities of issuing termination notice to the dpc for its failure to meet the contractual obligations under the ppa . the state government and mseb sources said that such a notice could be served by the mseb as dpc has not paid the rebate ( penalty ) of rs 409 crore for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power on january 28 and february 13 . the state government and mseb , which reviewed its position on saturday at a meeting convened by the chief minister vilasrao deshmukh , are of the view that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the termination notice to the dpc . the dpc ' s move to appoint mr k wade cline as its "" true and lawful attorney - in - fact "" deserves importance especially when the state government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit cost and gauge the possibility of sale of dabhol power to the power deficit states . mr cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the ordinary course in amounts exceeding rs 64 crore or the equivalent in foreign currency in any financial year . furthermore , mr cline would be in a position to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relating to the day - to - day operation of the company ' s business or exercise its rights and discharge its obligations under the project contracts and the financing agreements - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - business standard , monday , april 23 , 2001 dpc seeks ok to exit power project , tamal bandyopadhyay otherwise it cannot be a complete exercise , "" he added . deshmukh and the mseb team are scheduled to meet union finance minister yashwant sinha and power minister suresh prabhu on monday in new delhi to discuss the stalemate and find a acceptable solution for the same . "" i am meeting sinha and prabhu to request them to take an initiative and send representatives for the negotiations committee , "" he said . deshmukh ' s meeting with the centre comes at a crucial stage as dpc ' s lenders would be meeting in london , on the same day , to decide upon the future finances of the controversy marred 2 , 184 - mw project in dabhol . moreover , the dpc board is also scheduled to meet on april 25 in london to decide the fate of its $ 900 million project in dabhol , including winding up of its operations . the meeting would discuss the topmost item on the agenda , which was to empower dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up operations in the country . dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore plus interest towards the bills due for the months of december 2000 and january 2001 . asked whether the centre had send any feel over a possible clubbing together of the arbitration and conciliation processes , deshmukh replied in the negative . deshmukh said mseb chairman vinay bansal along with two senior officials would attend dpc ' s board meeting in london . bansal had said on sunday that mseb would present its case concerning the rs 401 - crore penalty that the loss - making board slapped on dpc on february 28 , for not generating required power within the stipulated time as per the ppa . currently , enron india holds 65 per cent in the $ 900 - million dpc project , which includes mseb ' s 15 per cent , while general electric and bechtel hold 10 per cent each .

"" - - energy review committee headed by former home secretary madhav godbole this could well be the real enron story a five - member high - powered committee headed by madhav godbole - and including former union economic affairs secretary e . a . s . sarma , hdfc chairman deepak parekh , teri chairman rajendrapachauri and maharashtra government official vinay mohan lal - has recommended a judicial probe into the entire enron power project deal saying it signified "" the utter failure of governance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision - making process relating to the dabhol project "" . the report , which was submitted to the maharashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by outlook , is severely critical of former chief minister sharad pawar ( with the congress then ) , the 13 - day bjp - led union government which reworked the deal in 1996 , shiv sena supremo balasaheb thackeray and his government in maharashtra headed by manohar joshi "" the utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every step of decision - making relating to the dabhol project . "" madhav godbole committee report an investigation , if ordered , could embarrass at least these three governments the report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal . according to the committee , the deal reveals failure of governance , both at the centre and state , and across different agencies . "" it strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coincidental , "" the report said , proposing a set of measures to be implemented if something of the project was to be retrieved . godbole and sarma also felt that the panel should categorically recommend the government of india to order a judicial inquiry . this was finally adopted by it . says a congress leader : "" enron could well become the biggest political issue in maharashtra and put to question liberalisation , particularly in the power sector . "" the proposal has already struck panic . says ncp ' s praful patel : "" if the enron decision has at all been detrimental , it is because of the haste with which phase 2 was cleared by the shiv sena - bjp government . now with the state having already entered into an agreement with enron , the important thing is to resolve it amicably . a judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it ' s not an issue of corruption but that of perception . "" pro - market congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the centre and the state which invited enron , even though the second phase was cleared by the bjp - shiv sena combine . says congress spokesperson jaipal reddy : "" right now we ' re too involved with the parliament deadlock over tehelka . "" pro - liberalisation congress mps also fear that such witch - hunting could send wrong signals to foreign investors . non - congress mps from maharashtra , meanwhile , claim that the godbole committee was instituted with the express purpose of politicising the enron issue . "" i think i know vilasrao deshmukh ' s gameplan , "" says an mp from the state . but some mps like congress ' prithviraj chavan question the cloak of secrecy that ' s surrounded the deal : "" i ' ve maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examine this "" . the committee report also says that had the enron project been subjected to a techno - economic appraisal , as envisaged under provisions of the electricity supply act of 1948 and related legislations , the infirmities could have been avoided . since this wasn ' t done , questions about a concerted effort towards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise , the exhaustive 93 - page report points out . "" i ' d highlight the speed with which the 13 - day vajpayee government cleared the project minutes before it quit , "" says congress mp prithviraj chavan . the enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberalisation in the early ' 90 s and , despite several controversies , is now an established power project at dabhol , 150 km south of mumbai . in july 1992 , enron signed an mou with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) to set up a 2 , 550 mw station as part of the government ' s ' fast track ' projects . subsequently , when the shiv - sena - bjp came to power in maharashtra it filed a writ against the project . this curiously led to renegotiations with enron . the committee has quoted a bombay high court order on the renegotiated deal . "" once it ( gom ) decided to revive the project , it acted in the very same manner its predecessors in office had done . it forgot all about competitive bidding and transparency . the speed with which the negotiating group studied the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons , which was accepted by dabhol , is unprecedented . "" says chavan : "" i would particularly like to highlight the speed with which the 13 - day vajpayee government at centre endorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned . "" since the commissioning of the plant in may 1999 , the mseb has paid rs 1 , 607 crore for the power it has bought from dabhol . if the same watttage of power had been bought from indian - built power plants fired by indigenous coal , the payment would have been approximately rs 736 crore . in the first year - and - a - half of its operation itself , the dpc had drained the maharashtra exchequer of nearly rs 1 , 000 crore . the central electricity authority ( cea ) , in fact , pointed out that the dabhol plant was not the least costly option . the mseb had other inexpensive alternatives like the four units of kaparkheda , but they were in a preliminary stage . the report notes : "" . . . if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pursue these projects , they might not have remained in their preliminary stages "" . it adds that the members were of the opinion that "" the mseb and the maharashtra government erred seriously , based on information available at that time , in proceeding with the dpc as a base - load factor even when its capacity was reduced . "" the failure seems to have been compounded by the laxity of the union power ministry , finance ministry and the cea . it quotes the cea as saying that since the union finance ministry found the tariff reasonable , no further examination was required strangely , bal thackeray ' s shiv sena , when it came to power together with the bjp in maharashtra , filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the deal . after the new shiv sena - bjp government took over , its cm , manohar joshi , appointed a renegotiating committee in 1996 which made the right noises , actually managing to reduce the tariff . but certain things remained inexplicable . no fresh clearances were required from the cea , which also said that "" since no cost increase was involved . . . fresh formal clearance wasn ' t necessary . "" says the committee : "" this only adds strength to the suspicion that the cea didn ' t consider the economic aspects of the project at all . indeed , given the non - availability of any official record of the meeting on june 24 , 1994 , with the committee and the nature of this letter dated december 23 , 1994 , the committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects of dpc were discussed at all . ' ' the credibility of the shiv sena - bjp government has been seriously questioned . "" the committee finds it unexplicable ( sic ) why there was no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from $ 2 , 828 million to $ 2 , 501 million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiating committee , "" the panel observes . says lawyer prashant bhushan : "" it is strange that the shiv sena - bjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly renegotiated the deal . "" the committee further spells out the losses incurred through the deal . "" subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc , the financial deterioration of mseb has been rapid . while the mseb was in profit in 1998 - 99 , it plunged into huge losses of rs 1681 crore in 1999 - 2000 . "" significantly , the world bank in 1993 had predicted the system ' s inherent weaknesses . in a letter written to the then power secretary , r . vasudevan , a top bank official had said that "" after a detailed review of the analytical framework and costing assumptions , we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that the dabhol project , as presently formulated , is not economically justified "" and that in "" our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb system in 1998 . the proposed base - load operation could result in uneconomic plant dispatch , as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be replaced by the higher cost lng power . "" enron ' s persistence and the ' gullibility ' of the indian side can be gauged from high - ranking enron official joe sutton ' s letter to a key indian official , ajit nimbalkar : "" i recently met with the world bank and have been following the articles in the india papers . i feel that the world bank opinion can be changed . we ' ll engage a pr firm and hopefully manage the media from here on . the project has solid support from all other agencies in washington . "" the key question in the enron deal is whether a developed state like maharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all ? for the first time the godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of such a project . according to the report , the mseb has been one of the better performing boards in the country and has , despite a faulty transmission and distribution ( t and d ) system , managed to consistently earn net revenue surpluses on an accrual basis . maharashtra accounts for nearly one - fourth of the gross value of india ' s industrial sector . it ' s one of the few states to achieve 100 per cent electrification . since ' 95 , the mseb has been adding to its generation . "" this improvement , which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation undertaken by the mseb , exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dpc was being considered , "" the report points out . following a policy of cross - subsidy , roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised . but the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn ' t been much . in fact , the subsidy claim decreased from rs 630 crore in 1995 - 96 to rs 355 crore in 1998 - 99 , until in 1999 - 2000 it increased nearly five - fold to rs 2 , 084 crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by 26 paise per unit - from 15 to 41 paise - an increase of 173 per cent .

"_ rightward movement _ review - - ii [ editor 's note : the following is the second part of a review of beerman et al . _ righward movement _ . the first part is to be found in the previous issue of linguist . ] most of frank drijkoningen 's paper ` morphological strength : np positions in french ' ( pp . 81-114 ) is devoted to a clever account of the relative ordering of subjects and verbs , and parts thereof , in french , with especially focus on inversion constructions , demonstrating that the data can be described in a manner consistent with kayne 's antisymmetry theory - - provided one adopts a certain amount of occam - stretching multiplication of functional heads with resultant multiple spec - positions as ` homes ' for subjects . drijkoningen argues fairly convincingly for the following hierarchical ordering of functional heads in french : [ c [ t [ agr ( s ) [ agr ( o ) [ agr ( a ) [ vp ] ] ] ] ] ] , identifying participial agreement not with agr ( o ) but with agr ( a ) , the checking-site for predicate - adjective agreement . he also offers a hypothesis with regard to a trigger for french stylistic inversion ( in which the subject np follows the verbal complex ) . his assumption is that ( in both french and english ) spec - head agr features in infl are ` strong ' , while head - features in infl are ` strong ' in french but ` weak ' in english . however , overt saturation of spec - head agr features in cp ( e . g . , by fronting an overt wh-expression ) significantly reduces the strength of spec - head agr features in ip , obviating the need for the subject np to rise to spec - agr ( s ) for checking . the paper is characterized by heavy reliance on ` floating / stranded _ tous _ ' , i . e . , a quantifier separated superficially from the np it modifies . this reviewer found little or no evidence of any awareness of the possibility of q - movement independent of movement of the modified np ; many of the starred strings could actually be derived , assuming a kayne approach , if q were allowed to move on its own . there was no sign of any argument that such movement is impossible ; perhaps it can be ruled out by lack of motivation . this paper is a thick , but rather strong argument for underlying svo and exclusively leftward - movement in french . of course , few linguists would contest that french is svo , and what evidence there may be for rightward - movement in this language has always been a best peripheral ( pun intended ) . given the strong arguments for rm and head-finality in other languages presented by bayer and buring & hartmann , this paper seems like a lot of sound and fury . erik hoekstra 's paper , ` analysing linear asymmetries in the verb clusters of dutch and frisian and their dialects ' ( pp . 153-170 ) , presents an analysis in terms of kayne 's lca hypothesis of the syntax of the complex verb clusters so especially characteristic of these languages . in the course of his discussion , it gradually becomes clear that , on the basis of the ordering of elements within these clusters , he distinguishes between dutch and frisian as respectively ` head-initial ' and ` head-final ' . it is clear to this reviewer why these labels are appropriate specifically with regard to the internal syntax of verb clusters , but describing dutch as ` head-initial ' is likely to be a surprise to many people who thought they knew otherwise . in discussing the feasibility , or lack thereof , of inserting non - verbal material ( including particles ) between members of a verb cluster , hoekstra not only demonstrates that this follows very reasonably from the lca - account he is proposing but claims ( p . 158 ) that ` the rigidity of head-final clusters [ i . e . , their intolerance of such insertion ] . . . is a mystery for any approach not incorporating asymmetry . ' in fact , it makes perfect sense if we assume an underlying head-final order and the derivation of alternative orders by the rm of verbal projections . this reviewer is not necessarily suggesting that this is a * better * approach than hoekstra 's lca - account , but it is certainly quite feasible , contrary to his apparent belief . in the last section , hoekstra spends a fair amount of time on a very interesting discussion of the infinitivum - pro - participio ( ipp ) effect , whereby in some germanic languages ( e . g . , dutch ) a ( perfective ) participle taking an infinitive verb as its complement must itself surface in the form of an infinitive . the primary questions at issue for hoekstra are : what is the formal grammatical nature of the ipp effect ? and why is it characteristic only of some ( germanic ) languages and not of others ? hoekstra argues that the ipp effect only occurs in languages in which the perfective participle is marked by a prefix , e . g . the germanic prefix ` ge - ' or reflexes thereof , and that this prefix occupies the spec position of the verb to which it is morphologically attached . since under these circumstances that spec position is already occupied , it is impossible for the infinitive complement to move into that position as it must , the derivation crashes ; the loophole exploited by dutch and other ipp languages ( this is , in fact , the traditional analysis in germanic scholarship ) is the substitution of an ` alternative ' form of the participle which is morphophonologically identical to the infinitive ( and therefore , in hoekstra 's view , has no obstructionist prefix ) . the fact that frisian does not exhibit ipp effects , according to this analysis , is directly related to the fact that in frisian the perfective participle is marked only by a suffix . this reviewer admits to not being familiar with the scholarly literature on the subject of ipp , but notes some curiosity as to how hoekstra 's claim ( p . 159 ) that ` the ipp effect is systematically absent in head - final germanic dialects ' can be squared with the fact that german , which is clearly head-final in the sense that hoekstra uses the term , typically marks perfective participles with a prefix and , indeed , exhibits ipp . the last few pages of the paper are devoted to a very nice little discussion of the recent evolution of ipp in a couple of frisian dialects , which hoekstra argues is due in both cases to remarkably heavy contact with dutch . in this reviewer 's opinion , this section represents a very desirable conjunction of scholarship and concerns in sociolinguistics and linguistic evolution on the one hand and formal grammatical theory on the other . in his paper ` movement in japanese relative clauses ' ( pp . 171-185 ) , satoshi stanley koike argues that all relative clauses in japanese , including the ` externally-headed ' ones whose ` heads ' are ( apparently ) ` extracted ' to their right , can be accounted for in terms of a kayne lca - type analysis allowing only spec - head - comp base structures and leftward movement . noting certain problems resulting from adopting kayne 's analysis , koike makes clear that they are almost certainly obviated by his ( * very interesting * ) proposal of a * discourse-based * motivation for the leftward movement his adoption of kayne 's lca approach forces him to assume . koike 's hypothesis that the movement of ip in these japanese cases is essentially stylistic movement , i . e . , motivated by pragmatic or discourse considerations rather than purely syntactic ones , at least implies that it is pf - movement which would ( 1 ) account for the fact that , in order for his analysis to make the right predictions , * have * to follow the movement of the semantic ` head ' np - - the latter being a proper ` syntactic ' movement - ( 2 ) be invisible as far as binding theory is concerned , binding theory being relevant primarily at lf and totally irrelevant at pf , and ( 3 ) not be subject to relativized minimality either . in their paper ` rightward wh - movement in american sign language ' ( pp . 247-278 ) , carol neidle , judy kegl , benjamin bahan , debra aarons , & dawn maclaughlin argue that americal sign language ( asl ) exhibits a head-final cp with a right-marginal spec as landing-site for wh - movement . they note ( p . 267 ) that this proposal ` is partially consistent with kayne 's claims about universal ordering ' , in that it places spec and complement on opposite sides of the head ; however , their proposal differs from kayne 's universal antisymmetry approach in positing a head-final structure for cp while assuming head-initial structures for all its complement-daughters . neidle et al . base much of their anti - lca argument on the fact that certain syntactic features ( including polarity , + / - wh , etc . ) are in asl expressed by ` non-manual markers ' ( e . g . , facial expressions ) which frequently spread over certain portions of the clauses they are associated with , and the very plausible notion that those portions can be defined as the c-command domains of the functional heads associated with these features . thus , the possibility , or lack thereof , of such spreading in asl is taken as symptomatic of the presence or absence of c-command relations ( p . 250 ) . it is on the basis of such spreading that they argue that the landing-site for wh - movement in asl , which is clearly to the right of the clause , nevertheless c-commands the latter , and they demonstrate that these c-command facts are incompatible with a kayne - type analysis . they briefly entertain analyses more consistent with kayne 's lca - hypothesis , involving the raising of c and ip into higher positions ( which , they note , must nevertheless be below positions , e . g . the landing-site of topicalization , known to be above cp in asl ) , but point out that there is ( 1 ) no evidence as to the functional nature of such positions , ( 2 ) no independent motivation for their existence , and ( 3 ) no evident motivation for the movement they are discussing . in their paper ` language types and generative grammar : a review of some consequences of the univeral vo hypothesis ' ( pp . 331-357 ) , caterina donati & alessandra tomaselli address the repercussions of kayne 's antisymmetry hypothesis for constituent-order typological studies . they demonstrate very neatly and elegantly the manifold empirical problems kayne 's approach has with languages representing a variety of types , including ( 1 ) ov languages with v2 ( german , dutch ) , ( 2 ) svo languages without pro-drop ( english , french ) , ( 3 ) svo languages with pro-drop ( italian ) , and ( 4 ) vso languages ( irish ) . repeatedly , they demonstrate that more traditional analyses provide more accurate results than analyses assuming kayne 's antisymmetry hypothesis . it should be noted that donati & tomaselli are throughout addressing specifically the relative ordering of verbs and nominals in ordinary , garden-variety clauses ; the details of extraposed structures such as those discussed by bayer , buring & hartmann , and haider are not addressed in this paper . while as already noted half the papers in this collection , understandably , discuss ` extraposition ' , it is unfortunate that there are no papers focussing ( pun intended ) on adverbal focus-movement , a serious alternative candidate for a rm analysis ( for which cf . schaufele 1990 , 1998 ) . neidle et al . 's paper relates to focus in an indirect way , in that it is commonly assumed that wh-elements are a priori focussed and that therefore their s - structure location , especially if there is anything remarkable about it , should be considered as at least a possible landing-site for focus-movement . as a sort of appendix , koike offers a short discussion of rightward focus-movement in turkish , in which he suggests that the same kind of discourse-analysis motivation he proposes for the movement leftward of ` backgrounded ' relative clauses ( away from their semantic ` heads ' ) in japanese can also motivate the movement leftward of * non-focussed * arguments in turkish , leaving the focussed subject stranded in immediately pre-verbal position ( at least in terms of superficial order ) . this reviewer notes , however , that koike makes reference to a single turkish example , a very simple clause involving only three constituents , an object np , a subject np , and a verb , and doubts very much that such an account as he proposes would be able to make much sense out of the much more complex examples of subject-focussing discussed in schaufele 1990 , 1998 . i have complaints about muller 's and hoekstra 's papers at an expository level , in that both assumed on the part of the reader a high degree of familiarity with the languages being discussed . muller provides no english translations for any of his german example sentences , or for that matter of the one hindi example sentence . while this reviewer has little trouble reading and interpreting example sentences in these languages , such facility cannot be expected of most readers of this collection . likewise , hoekstra offered no translations of any of his example sentences , and in many cases this reviewer , who is not unfamiliar with a wide variety of germanic languages , was quite unable to make any sense out of them . furthermore , it is frequently not made clear which language the example in question is meant to represent ; since the paper as a whole depends crucially on distinctions between dutch and frisian , this is a source of serious obscurity . and only on p . 158 , the 6th page of a fairly short paper , does hoekstra finally tell us that the gloss ` mp ' stands for ` modal particle ' , after having used this abbreviation freely in several earlier examples . this abbreviation may be familiar to specialists in netherlandic , but it is n't to a lot of other interested readers . in koike 's paper the inclusion of japanese words in the midst of the english - language text without any typographical highlighting by either quotes or italics , especially in a book with many typographical errors , proved a little unsettling ; this was also a problem in muller 's paper , where it was particularly confusing in the one section that discussed extraposition in english . the book as a whole is plagued with typographical errors . there are two examples ( 59 ) in drijkoningen 's paper . haider 's ( 58a ) is starred , but is in fact an ok string , and it 's obvious from context that haider regards it as ok . in buring & hartmann 's paper , there are exs . ( 21a ) and ( 22a ) , but no ( 21b ) or ( 22b ) ; diagram ( 24 ) is nowhere referred to in the text ( though it 's pretty obvious what it refers to ) . [ bayer in press ] is referred to several times in bayer 's paper , but it does n't appear anywhere in the references ; perhaps it 's represented by bayer 1996 ? the statement of wiltschko 's locality constraint is misprinted on p . 360 in such a way as to be nonsensical . in koike 's paper the alignment of the glosses in ( 20a ) was impossible to make any sense out of , and i had to study ( 10 ) a while before i realized that , although it said literally ` [ dp ip d [ cp np / qp [ c [ ip . . . ' , those biliterals ` dp ' , ` cp ' , and ` ip ' were in some instances meant to be labels on the immediately preceding brackets , not left-daughters of the constituents enclosed within said brackets . mahajan 's paper is particularly plagued with typographical errors ; to mention merely the most egregious example i found , in ( 54 ) the entire direct object np is missing from the hindi string , rendering this example 's relevance to the discussion is completely opaque . as already noted here and there , many of the substantive flaws in this collection are due primarily or entirely to lack of space in which to present relevant arguments . fulfilling the preface 's promise of open-mindedness , the book brings together papers from several different viewpoints , both supporting and undermining kayne 's antisymmetry hypothesis . while many of the contributors obviously hold rather strongly to whatever side of this controversy they espouse , many of them are to be commended for the skill and seriousness they nevertheless give to the necessary task of considering possible alternative analyses that would support the other side . while many of the papers focus on languages , and constructions within those languages , that have already been much discussed in the generative literature , there are some admirable exceptions ; i would especially mention the papers by bayer , hoekstra , and neidle et al . in this regard , also the typological interest behind the paper by donati & tomaselli although they restrict themselves primarily to western european languages . anyone concerned about understanding the debates arising out of kayne 's antisymmetry hypothesis and the grounds both for taking it seriously and for rejecting it cannot afford to ignore this collection . references . bayer , josef .

arrangement you have with your client, and I'm betting that that's not at
all cut and dried.However, I have been in this situation where a client was using code I
developed and then decided that he should own the code. Push never came to
shove (at least, not yet :-) ) but my understanding of the situation vis a
vis software is that in the absence of any contract granting ownership of
the code to another party, it remains with the person who wrote it. I didn't
take legal advice on this but my customer did :-) and his lawyer told him
that I was right and would most likely win in court.So much for the ownership of the code vis a vis you and your client - now for
the GPL issues. Code compiled by a compiler which is GPL software (e.g. gcc) is not itself
covered by the GPL unless its author chooses to make it so. This is perhaps
not made clear enough in the GPL text and is a particular piece of FUD which
Microsoft loves to toss about. Similarly, the copy of PHP which is part of
your customer's system is covered by the GPL. You can charge him whatever
you like for it but you must provide him with acces to the source code, and
you cannot restrict what he can do with it (in this case, move it to another
service provider). However, you have not (I take it) chosen to license YOUR
code under the GPL so the conditions of the GPL do NOT apply to it.If OTOH you had written some code which modified PHP as such, and then
distributed (whether for a fee or not) that modified PHP, then the modified
code must be licensed under the GPL. But this applies to a modification to
PHP itself and NOT to your scripts which run under PHP.The relevant clause is 2(b) which says (though Lord knows why I'm quoting when
locate COPYING will turn up a shedload of copies of the GPL on just about
any Linux box - 540 on this box)b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
this License.
Your PHP scripts do not contain, nor are they derived from, PHP, in whole or
in part.> I know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciatedMicrosoft has very much made this a Linux issue - it has attempted to imply
that any company using GPL software must make everything it owns public and
it must be true - that nice man from Microsoft wouldn't lie, would he ?Niall--

 CNETÂ TECH1,005.33 Â 15.22Techs rise, but Dow falls on day of Bush speech
Technology shares climbed Monday as Pres. Bush gave a speech outlining a plan for long-term growth.Tech investors also heard positive comments on Intel by C.S. First Boston, and snapped up shares in the chip, storage and computer server hardware sectors. CNET's Tech index rose 15.22 points, or 1.53 percent, to 1,005.33, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 9.04 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,382.54.Amid news of a weakening dollar and an unexpected rise in business inventories in May, broader markets sank. Recovering some from early-day losses, the Dow Jones industrials finished by giving up 45.4 points, or 0.52 percent, to 8,639.1, and the S&P 500 slid 3.47 points, or 0.38 percent, to 917.92.
Will IBM's new ""Shark"" sink or swim? 
IBM announced a new top-end ""Shark"" storage system Monday that could boost the company's prospects against entrenched competitors in the depressed storage market.
Three years ago, IBM introduced its first Enterprise Storage System product, code-named Shark, in an attempt to rebuild a market it had almost totally ceded to rivals EMC and Hitachi Data Systems.INTL BUSINESS MACHINES 71.00 2.59% New products help absorb AMD pain 
Advanced Micro Devices turned out two new chips Monday, but its most anticipated release this week will be its second quarter results.
As expected, AMD launched on Monday a new mobile Athlon XP 1800+ chip for notebooks. The company also announced Monday it has begun shipping MirrorBit, its newest flash memory product for storing data in cell phones and other devices.ADVANCED MICRO DEV 9.25 1.65% Microsoft tries to steal Macworld thunder 
Microsoft on Monday launched the first of several pre-emptive strikes against Apple Computer's Macworld trade show by making announcements about new technologies far ahead of their delivery to market.
The strategic attack comes as tensions mount between Apple and Microsoft. During Macworld five years ago, the two companies announced a five-year technology agreement, whereby Microsoft committed to continued development of Office and Internet Explorer for the Mac.MICROSOFT CORP 51.80 -0.12%

C.S. First Boston expects an upbeat outlook from Intel in tech notes 7/15/02 
Analyst Tim Mahon predicts the chip titan will report second-quarter results in-line with expectations, but offer better-than-expected guidance for the third quarter. Intel rival AMD's poor quarterly results stemmed more from company-specific issues than PC market troubles, Mahon says. And he points to other evidence of PC strength, such as Dell's positive comments about the current quarter. Mahon also expects Intel to speak confidently about its new 845G chipset, which he suggests could pressure the shares of graphics chip firms. Mahon reiterates a ""buy"" rating on Intel.INTEL CORP 19.12 6.28%

"Gary Lawrence Murphy:
>OK, but only if you also meant religious and alcoholic extremes ;)Since it was my quip, I'll point out that I used
the term ""alcoholism,"" implying addiction. I
drink. I'm not an alcoholic. Most people who drink
don't go to AA meetings. Most people who go to AA
meetings do (try very hard) not to drink.As to religion, I think it is harmful and risky in
almost any degree. Were I single, I might consider
potential mates who partook of the less irrational
or more light-hearted religions. A Unitarian or
Buddhist might be an example of the first, a Wiccan
of the second. But someone who is both irrational
and serious about that irrationality strikes me as
a bad choice of partner, moreso than someone who
was addicted to some drug. Alcoholics and drug
addicts at least have the sense to battle their
problem, and to keep their children from suffering
it. The religious revel in their irrationality,
and want to raise their children in it. That's a
difficult difference for two parents to
reconcile.Fortunately, I am long and happily enamored of
someone who has no religious tendencies.

"update - reimbursement of individually billed items the use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few years . as a result the accounts payable department has seen a rapid increase in the number of invoices and vendors . with the higher volume , we have reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle . although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual employees , they often mail invoices directly to accounts payable . at times they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone . in these cases we return the invoice to the vendor . if the employee is designated , we try to track him / her down and forward the invoice . the high level of employee movement among jobs and locations at enron has made this increasingly challenging . either way , we end up doing something less productive than paying invoices . to maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary for research , we request that employees who have pagers , cell phones , and other individually billed items such as licenses , subscriptions , etc . , pay for them by personal check or charge card ( if applicable  * payment instructions are usually indicated on the invoice ) and request reimbursement through employee expense reports . by submitting these charges on your expense report , you can help us reduce the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices , the number of checks generated by treasury , the number of vendors in our database , and the turnaround time for payment of invoices . incidentally , accounts payable is currently installing a corporate - wide web - based expense reporting system similar to what enron international has used for the past year . this will make it even easier to file your expense report and receive quick reimbursement . we  , d like to make this effective immediately . if you have any questions or suggestions , please contact the accounts payable department .",Safe Email

                 the kind of people who DO NOT take risks.          If you are the kind of person who will consider doing 
     something that's NOT a 'sure thing', then do NOT respond.                    This is too easy a way to make money

"comparative method ( shared sound changes ) alice faber 's very sound posting brings up a very important point : indvidual sound changes , especially those which are known to be common in languages of the world , cannot be the basis of subclassification . what you need is either sets of unrelated changes ( english has diphthongized some of the same long high vowels as high german , so that eis and ice , haus and house sound rather similar , but they do not share other changes ) , or a chronology of the sound changes with respect to other changes ( e . g . , the diphthongization in english was presumably preceded by the loss of / x / or / c , / , but there is no such change in high german ) . on the other hand , we find that the northern uto - aztecan languages share the changes of intervocalic / l / - ) / n / , / n / - > velar nasal , and / c / - > / y / . any one of these would mean little , but all three together ( and the fact that the / l / - ) / n / does not feed the / n / - > / ng / change ) make it reasonably certain that these really are shared innovations , and that northern uto - aztecan is a genuine classificatory unit ( a valid node in the uto - aztecan tree , if you will ) - - something that has until recently been generally doubted .",Safe Email

recall seeing the word used transitively in that sense, and web1913
lists that sense as ""v. i."", or intransitive.  The transitive sense of
""shiver"", which we no longer use but which people used widely in the
1800s (web1913 doesn't even list it as archaic or obsolete), means
""to shatter into splinters, normally with a blow"".Shivering a boat's timbers, of course, leaves you with no boat.
(Shivering some of them, which will happen if you hit a rock hard enough,
leaves you with a sinking boat.)So, ""Shiver my timbers if I do,"" can be reasonably interpreted as a more
vivid way of saying, ""May I die suddenly if I do.""  The interpretation
suggested by Quinion, ""May my boat be damaged,"" neither makes as much
sense in context nor obeys the normal rules of grammar.I've sent a copy of this to Quinion.

Date: Not suppliedSince the AmphetaDesk source code is so easily modifiable on any platform, I've 
been seeing some interesting hacks and modifications lately. The most powerful 
of them is l.m. orchard's newest template[1], which provides an insane amount 
of new features, including hiding old items, click counting, and an outline 
based format. More than likely, a revised version of his hack will appear as a 
selectable template in the next version (AmphetaDesk v0.94). Also of interest is Brian Cantoni's FTPStore[2]: _""FTPstore is a slight 
addition to the AmphetaDesk news aggregator. The modified code will retrieve 
the personal channel list from an FTP location during startup and store it back 
to the same location during shutdown. This provides a simple method to keep 
your saved channels in a network location. If you use AmphetaDesk at home and 
at work, for example, this feature will let you keep your list of channels in 
sync.""_ It's a major improvement for AmphetaDesk users with multiple machines.[1] http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000228.phtml

"" simply stated , we have two problems : supply is too low and costs are too high . both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in 1996 . but no matter how we got into this mess , you hired me to solve problems . and that ' s what i ' m doing . "" the only long - term solution is to build more power plants . we must also cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities . but prices won ' t fall and supply won ' t be truly reliable until we generate more power than we consume . "" yet in the 12 years before i took office , not a single major power plant was built in california . not one . since i became governor , we ' ve licensed 12 major power plants . ten more are in the pipeline . and we ' re doing this without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water . "" deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating companies . the generators are free to charge whatever they want because they ' re governed only by federal regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices . "" this past winter , the prices charged by the generators shot through the roof , driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy . "" in january , with the feds still refusing to do their job , california stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to buy . we didn ' t take over to save the utilities . we took over to keep the power on and the economy strong . that ' s not all : - - we also negotiated long - term contracts for electricity at vastly lower prices . - - i used my emergency powers to seize control of low - cost power contracts the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators . - - we began negotiations to buy the utilities ' transmission system . - - we cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of power plants . - - we ' re launching an $ 800 million conservation program . - - we ' re moving to establish a public power authority to build more power . if the private sector fails to build all the plants california needs , we ' ll build them ourselves . - - and because i share your concern that the generators are ripping us off , we ' re using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal conduct . "" we can ' t fix 12 years of inaction overnight . but we ' re making real progress . "" now , as you know , i have fought tooth and nail against raising rates . it ' s become increasingly clear , however , that with rising natural gas prices , the feds ' failure to control costs , and the state ' s lack of supply , that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong . "" but i remain committed to protecting average californians from massive rate hikes . so i ' m urging the public utilities commission to adopt a plan that will protect average consumers , reward those who conserve and motivate the biggest users to cut back . "" under my proposal , more than half of you won ' t pay a penny more . for the rest , the average increase will be 26 1 / 2 percent . for many of that group , rates will rise only about 10 percent . the heaviest users will see their rates rise 34 1 / 2 percent on average . that includes business paying their share . this is in addition to the 9 percent surcharge we ' ve all been paying since last winter . "" but all californians can reduce their bills through conservation . "" here ' s the point : the more you use , the more you pay . the more you conserve , the more you save . conservation is our best short - term weapon against blackouts and price - gouging . by flexing your power , you ' ll help secure our energy future . "" unlike the puc , my plan includes funds to restore the utilities to financial stability - - if they agree to three main conditions : "" they must provide low - cost regulated power to the state for 10 years . agree to sell us their transmission system . and dismiss their lawsuits seeking to double your electricity rates . "" my proposal raises rates fairly , assures us of long - term power , stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation . "" our emphasis on conservation is critical . in order to make it through the summer , we must cut demand by at least 10 percent . "" already we ' ve launched programs to cut back commercial lighting , and reduce consumption in office buildings , schools and government facilities . "" friends , we have a power shortage but we are far from powerless . we are 34 million strong and if each of us does our part , we can minimize disruptions and get through the summer . we are californians . we ' ve withstood earthquakes , floods , fires , and droughts .

message from you. I don't see any reason that email
software that automatically uses digital signatures
for contact management and whitelisting would be
any more expensive than existing email clients.
Unless Microsoft manages to get a defacto monopoly
on it.(3) I think identity theft should be made a felony,
with very stiff penalties, for reasons that have
nothing to do with spam. No, obviously, simply
parading around with a sign that says ""I'm George
Bush"" is not identity theft. On the other hand,
I think using a virus to compromise someone else's
private key should should fall into that category.

time I launch my mail program -- never more than once per day,
sometimes once per week. For some of myy workstations, I'd even be happy with the necessary
signing key being cached on disk, so signing is automatic when I

The problem has now been isolated and HP has been preparing a fix, which will be available within the next 48 hours.3) We won't comment on the specifics of our discussions with SnoSoft. However, we take our customers' security requirements very seriously and have a strong track record following industry-standard security practices.4) Where and how the DMCA should be applied is a matter of great controversy. The reported letter to SnoSoft was not consistent or indicative of HP's policy. We can say emphatically that HP will not use the DMCA to stifle research or impede the flow of information that would benefit our customers and improve their system security.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Robin D.

mostly left alone. There'd be brainstorm meetings to come up with new topics to 
tackle (""Howsabout 'Diligence'?"" ""No I think we did that one already, didn't 
we?"") but mostly you could just hang around, bang away at whatever ideas you 
had, show your manager what you were working on, and he/she'd give you 
feedback, encouragement, tell you to keep at it, point to the poster of 
Stick-to-it-iveness on their wall (Yes, we had our own brand of Successories 
posters hanging everywhere. I mean why not.) and give you the thumbs up.â€[1] http://www.whygodwhy.com/archive/000071.html

Date: Not suppliedArticle about a scam expert who belives the mom who beat her child is a grifter 
belonging to the Irish Travelers. The reason she beat up her little girl, he 
thinks, is becasue she was pissed that the kid blew her con at a toy store.     Wright believes the beating happened for one of two reasons. ""The little 
    girl gave away the scam to an employee or the mom was so ticked off at not 
    getting refunds she took it out on the little girl."" I don't know anything about the Irish Travelers, but I'm wondering if they are 
getting a bad rap about being con-artists. This Irish Traveler FAQ[1] says 
""some Travellers are con men, but, just like other Americans, most are not.""

"re : transitional assignments all i have received a few notes about this since this one but i will try to respond to all questions here . please see below responses in red : enron capital sally - husband and 3 children - ages 15 , 11 and 2 ) . i understand that the houses which have been vacated due to returning expats have all been filled , so can you have someone arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them ? i think the best way to go here is for us to use serviced apartments as it will be very difficult to find a lease for such a short period for this type of accommodation . my assistant , lisa , has put a call in to a service who can help us find serviced accommodation in south kensington / chelsea area or in dolphin square where we have people now who are very satisfied . is there a reason you are partial to south kensington / chelsea ? what if we find accommodation in another nice area of london within a short commute to the office ? when i have some options , i will let you know , probably on monday . immigration - due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and have made trips already , i feel it would be best to apply for work permits versus using the visa waiver . i have sent them the forms and requested that brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his sometime shortly after he arrives in the uk . i have informed him that he should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by april 1 . brent ' s work permit will be submitted today and we may receive if before april lst , but it is unlikely . the way it works for this is as follows : brent will receive the work permit from us and if he is here , he will have to leave the uk and enter with the work permit for it to be validated . if his family are in houston , they will need to receive entry clearance in the us prior to arriving in the uk . this takes approx 7 working days and they will require either brent ' s original passport and work permit or a certified copy of each along with other things such as marriage and birth certificates . if brent decides to bring his family with him to london prior to receiving the work permit , they must say they are coming on a vacation for a short period of time and have a return ticket to back it up . once the permit is received , the family can either travel back to houston and submit the entry clearance visas there or they can all travel to amsterdam where they are currenlty issuing entry clearance without a problem . there is always a small element of risk in going to amsterdam , however , as do not have to issue the stamps there , they just do it because they are nice ! work permits are arriving approx 4 weeks from date of submission . we can discuss all of this on the 20 th . tax - please confirm whether paye will need to be paid for them during the short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit . paye is due after 60 days ; however , if brent and sally are really only going to be here for approx 75 days , i am not going to inform the revenue that they are here . if this extends beyond the set time , we can look at options but the only responsiblility that brent and sally will have is to ensure they complete the tax organiser in order for us to get the tax back . also , as we would have to apply the treaty here , we need to ensure the salary costs stay in houston . jane , have you discussed this point ? benefits - i have suggested that they remain on us domestic payroll and benefits and , if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent in the us , they may claim the excess on the expense report . agreed . per diem - we need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size . jane , please call me to discuss . i have left you a message , thanks let me know of any other issues we need to address . as always , i appreciate your help . jane",Safe Email

"The Scotsman - 22 August 2002 Playboy wants to go out with a bang 
 
 
 AN AGEING Berlin playboy has come up with an unusual offer to lure women into
 his bed - by promising the last woman he sleeps with an inheritance of 250,000
 (Â£160,000). 
 
 Rolf Eden, 72, a Berlin disco owner famous for his countless sex partners,
 said he could imagine no better way to die than in the arms of an attractive
 young woman - preferably under 30. 
 
 ""I put it all in my last will and testament - the last woman who sleeps with
 me gets all the money,"" Mr Eden told Bild newspaper. 
 
 ""I want to pass away in the most beautiful moment of my life. First a lot of
 fun with a beautiful woman, then wild sex, a final orgasm - and it will all
 end with a heart attack and then IÂ’m gone."" 
 
 Mr Eden, who is selling his nightclub this year, said applications should be
 sent in quickly because of his age. ""It could end very soon,"" he said.

The above situation occurs precisely because of the major functional difference
between symbolic links (AKA soft links, or symlinks to their friends) and hard
links. Two hard links to the same file are exactly equivalent - one is no more
the files ""real"" directory entry than is the other. OTOH a symlink is a special
thing which is a link to a real file, and when the file linked to is erased, you
end up with a broken symbolic link - you can't have a broken hard link (except
of course in the case of a banjaxed filesystem).

"silverman book review silverman , daniel . ( 1997 ) . phasing and recoverability . outstanding dissertations in linguistics series . new york : garland publishing . 242 pages . reviewed by stefan frisch , university of michigan . this book is a revised version of the author 's 1995 ucla dissertation . the primary thesis defended by silverman is that auditory salience plays an important role in explaining the typology of phonological segment inventories . the relative phasing of laryngeal and supralaryngeal gestures is examined as a case study . silverman demonstrates there is a typological preference for phasing patterns in which the gestures are optimally recoverable . further , he proposes that sub-optimal patterns are only found in inventories where the optimal patterns are also present . ( note that silverman does not crucially adopt the segment as a phonological primitive . he is concerned primarily with gestures and their realization in a system of syntagmatic contrasts . the terms 's egment ' and 's egment inventory ' are used only for expository convenience . ) synopsis : chapter 1 . introduction this chapter introduces the primary thesis : cross - linguistically , laryngeal and supralaryngeal gestures are phased to make their values maximally auditorily salient . silverman argues that parallel production of contrastive gestures is informationally optimal , but only if those gestures are auditorily recoverable . in cases where parallel production would make contrastive values unrecoverable , gestures are serially sequenced . for example , in aspirated stops , laryngeal abduction is sequences to follow the stop closure , resulting in broadband noise . if laryngeal abduction and stop closure were simultaneous , the state of the larynx would not be recoverable from the resulting acoustic signal ( silence ) . silverman also introduces the ' gestural score ' notation of articulatory phonology ( browman & goldstein , 1986 ) used in the description of the gestural patterns . each gestural score is accompanied by a set of temporally aligned descriptions of acoustic cues which highlight the importance of the recoverability of the gestures . the resulting segmental percept is also given , to highlight whether all of the contrastive segmental information has been effectively transmitted . using this notation , he exemplifies the four logically possible phasing patterns : parallel , sequenced , expanded , or truncated . in the parallel phasing pattern , two gestures are phased to be fully simultaneous . in the sequenced pattern , two gestures are serially ordered . in the expanded pattern , one gesture both begins before and ends after another . in the truncated pattern , one gesture is phased to be simultaneous with a portion ( beginning or end ) of another gesture . chapter 2 . previous work in this chapter , silverman reviews previous research on articulatory timing , auditory response to acoustic signals , and the relevance of auditory contrastiveness to segmental inventories . two results are of particular importance . first , a combination of auditory factors favor patterns where low intensity signals are followed by high intensity signals . second , languages employ contrasts which are maximally auditorily distinct . chapter 3 . obstruents and laryngeal gestures this chapter contains typological evidence to support silverman 's thesis . cross - linguistically , laryngeal gestures of abduction or constriction are overwhelmingly phased to follow supralaryngeal constriction , which maximizes the recoverability of both gestures . the sub-optimal pattern , where the laryngeal gesture precedes the stop release is found only when the optimal pattern is also present . for obstruents , which have a minimum of acoustic energy to work with , these are the only two phasing patterns . chapter 4 . sonorants and laryngeal gestures sonorants have a greater amount of acoustic energy , and so laryngeal gestures can overlap with supralaryngeal gestures . the most attested pattern , for languages which do have a laryngeal contrast for sonorants , is for the laryngeal gesture to be truncated to the beginning portion of the supralaryngeal gesture . parallel to the obstruent case , this phasing pattern puts the low-energy breathy or glottalized portion of the sonorant before the high-energy modally-voiced portion , maximizing auditory salience . again , the less optimal pattern truncates the laryngeal gesture to the latter portion of the supralaryngeal gesture . ordinarily , the laryngeal and supralaryngeal gestures are not completely overlapped , as contrastive supralaryngeal gestures ( such as nasal place of articulation , for example ) would be rendered non - recoverable . however , an interesting special case is found in laterals . due to the formant structure of laterals , languages generally do not have contrasts in their place of articulation . thus , in some cases ( e . g . zulu ) , contrastive laryngeal gestures are realized fully parallel with the supralaryngeal gesture . a similar pattern is found for coda nasals in comaltapec chinantec , where the place of articulation is contextually determined . in contrast to onset nasals , which have contrastive place of articulation , laryngeal abduction is realized in parallel with the supralaryngeal gesture in coda nasals and no contrasts are lost . chapter 5 . vowels and laryngeal gestures in this chapter , vowels with contrastive laryngeal gestures are discussed . silverman claims that , since vowels have an abundance of acoustic energy , laryngeal gestures can be implemented in parallel with supralaryngeal gestures without loss of auditory contrast . however , this pattern is auditorily the least optimal . like the sonorant case , the optimal pattern is for the laryngeal gesture to be truncated to the beginning portion of the vowel , resulting in ? v or hv sequences . less optimal is the opposite phasing pattern , resulting in v ? or vh . typologically hv is indeed much more prevalent than voiceless vowels or vh ( and similarly for laryngeal constriction ) . the bulk of the chapter ( and the book ) is devoted to ' laryngeally complex ' vowels in the otomanguean languages . the term larygeally complex is used for vowels which realize both contrastive phonation ( breathy or creaky ) and tone . one example , comaltapec chinantec , has eight vowel qualities with five tonal qualities and two voice qualities . in addition , this language has nasalization and a length contrast which leads to 320 possible realizations of the nucleus . not surprisingly , words in this language are generally monosyllabic , and nucleus quality is used to differentiate many of the lexical contrasts . silverman argues that simultaneous realization of breathiness / creakiness and tone would render the tone contrasts unrecoverable . the cross-linguistically prevalent pattern is for the laryngeal contrast to be truncated to the beginning of the vowel , which is auditorily optimal . the tone is then saliently realized during modal phonation in the latter portion of the vowel . the opposite sequencing , with the laryngeal after the tonal contrast ( and modal phonation ) is also attested . silverman finds only two cases where tonal and laryngeal contrasts are executed simultaneously ( the tibeto - burman languages mpi and tamang ) . in one of those cases , there are only two tones , so tonal contrasts may not be in as much danger , as the tones would be more distinct than in the case of comaltapec chinantec , with eight tones . critical evaluation : overall , this is an inspirational volume demonstrating the importance of auditory / phonetic explanation for phonological patterning . it is one of the first of a series of ucla dissertations on this topic , which together address a wide range of phonological phenomena . silverman 's analysis bridges the phonetics / phonology gap in a number of ways . for example , an arbitrary number of phasing differences , which might be dismissed as ' phonetic implementation ' , are shown to be reducible to a small set that can be phonologically contrastive . this reduction , via the more abstract temporal relationships of simultaneity and precedence , nicely complements work in speech perception on the cross-linguistic ( and cross-species ) robustness of the categorical perception of voice onset time continua ( kuhl & miller , 1975 ; pisoni , 1977 ) . to its credit , this book contains over a dozen reasonably detailed case studies on the realization of laryngeal contrasts in different languages . in many cases , recordings were available so the presence of the phasing relationships were verified , and spectrograms of appropriate examples are given . these case studies often address potential counterexamples to silverman 's typological claims . for example , the mon - khmer language chong possesses coda stops with contrastive creakiness , but creakiness is realized only in the non-optimal way as a pre-glottalized stop . in the chong case , however , other aspects of the morphophonology require the non-optimal realization to avoid loss of contrast . in particular , coda stops are obligatorily unreleased , and the language is non-suffixing . due to these additional constraints , post-glottalized phasing would not saliently encode the larygneal contrast . this type of constraint interaction is quite compatible with the general approach of optimality theory ( prince & smolensky , 1993 ) , and in fact the original version of this dissertation presented constraint tableau in such cases . the proposed constraints are quite broad and were informally described , so the optimality theoretic analysis did not add to the exposition , and the book reads more easily without it . despite the lack of a formalist analysis , this book raises a number of issues which are relevant to current formal concerns . in the otomanguean language copala trique there are different phasing relationships between vocalic and laryngeal gestures . the laryngeal gestures ( breathiness and creakiness ) can be truncated to the first portion of the vowel , the second portion of the vowel , or can ' interrupt ' the vowel , appearing in the middle . these three locations for a laryngeal gesture support lexical contrasts , and there is clear evidence that the interrupted vowels are monosyllabic . encoding these three configurations using more abstract representations than articulatory phonology is no trivial task . in addition , the correspondence theory approach to faithfulness considers segmentally aligned and ordered input and output ( mccarthy & prince , 1995 ) . the presence of relatively small but contrastive differences in phasing require subsegmental correspondence relations between the input and output . another missing aspect of an optimality theoretic analysis would be a factorial typology of constraint interactions . while silverman 's coverage is quite extensive , i would be interested in seeing a discussion of the pros and cons for each logical possibility in phasing between laryngeal and supralaryngeal gestures . such a discussion will eventually be needed in order to determine whether the silverman 's proposal is is truly predictive , or just informally defined to the extent that any observed pattern could be explained . in a few instances , silverman makes use of the upsid database of segmental inventories ( maddieson , 1986 ) to demonstrate that the typological predictions are satisfied . unfortunately , quantitative differences are not reported in most cases . while sufficient data may not be available , a quantitative analysis is desirable in order to address a current question in work on phonetic explanation for phonological patterns : are non-optimal patterns avoided to the degree that they are non-optimal ? in other words , is the hypothesized functional force of auditory recoverability transparently reflected in the patterns within and across languages , or is it ' phonologized ' in some way by the language learner such that there is no quantitative relationship ? the answer to this question has implications for the architecture of the phonetically grounded grammar , as quantitative constraints or quantitative constraint rankings would be required . this book touches on a number of other very important issues that should be topics of ongoing research . the central role of the recoverability of contrasts leads inevitably to the question : what is a contrast ? assuming the psychological reality of the segment provides a simple answer , but one which is not entirely correct . the three contrastive phasing relationships in copala trique are not amenable to a segmental analysis . in chong , a combination of coda unrelease and lack of suffixation is claimed to lead to pre-glottalized stops . this case is contrasted with korean , where there is some suffixation , and post-glottalized stops are maintained in that environment but neutralized elsewhere . i wonder how frequent the neutralizing environment must be before a non-optimal pattern becomes necessary or the contrast is lost ? why is n't the laryngeal gesture phased before the stop closure in the neutralizing environment , but after in the non-neutralizing environment ? perhaps some other constraint is involved here . in many of the case studies given , the simple syllable structure and monosyllabic tendencies of the languages are mentioned as reasons why complex and non-optimal phasing relations are found at all ( in most cases , the optimal recoverability of supralaryngeal gestures is found if contrastive laryngeal gestures are not used at all ) . this suggests that there is some minimal set of contrasts required to create a sufficient number of open class items for a language to be a useful communication system , and that differences in syllable structure , word length , and segmental inventory size interact in some fashion to this end . the answers to these deeper questions appear to be closer to our understanding when the phonological system is conceptualized as implied in this book , as a combinatorial system of articulatory / acoustic contrasts highly constrained by a variety of functional factors . references :

Kerne, kernel-smp and kernel-enterprise are the kernel packages you

kernel-BOOT and kernel-doc aren't matched. If it just said ""kernel"", it

I wanted to get back to this but didn't have the time.  I actually lived on
a couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwest
and also spent a fair amount time in Lakota/Sioux country as well.  And my
parents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than
I have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents).  I
do get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-hand
from my father.The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly because
it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income.  While it
is true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as a
consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, not
something that was impressed upon them.The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity
that exists separately from the individuals, typically an ""Indian
Corporation"" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a
single share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from
tribe to tribe).  In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of the
tribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k per
person, depending on the tribe.  The dividend money comes from a number of
places, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov't and various
businesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation.You have to understand a couple things:  First, a great many Indian tribes
are run as purely communist enterprises.  Everyone gets a check for their
share no matter what.  One of the biggest problems this has caused is very
high unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happy
take their dividend and not work.  The dividend they receive from the
corporation often constitutes their sole ""income"" for government accounting
purposes.  Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no one
works, they've had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those
dividends.  Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because
they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works.  One of the ironies is
that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn,
many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white
folk, not Indians.Second, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they also
receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation
to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually.  By
benefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no other
ordinary American receives from either their employer or the government.It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are
ineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority are
very smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with good
credentials to run their business divisions.  An example of this is the
Haida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, has
billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have
gross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing).  Yet the
dividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particular
case, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before
drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to
intelligent investment and use.  They don't eat their seed corn, and have
actually managed to grow their stash.  In contrast, a couple islands over,
there is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50
million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal
government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets.  This
particular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expenditures
per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many
borrow money against future income.  Incidentally, in this particular case,
the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand
dollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather
than their own pockets.Somewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuable
assets to these tribes when they've burned through the ones previously given
where feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreign
companies.  And the cycle continues.So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems?  In a
nutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society.Few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant.  Incest, rape, and
gross promiscuity is rampant.  Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse during
pregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very
substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded.  Many of
the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the
earliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above.  On one
reservation my parents lived, the HIV infection rate was >70%.  Many of
these societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law is
arbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, police
etc).In short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a
shambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I
have ever seen anywhere.  Because of their legal status, there really aren't
that many consequences for their behavior.  There are many things that I
could tell you that I've seen that you probably would not believe unless
you'd seen it yourself.  There are always good people in these tribes, but
it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good
guys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically.  (BTW,
if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as
a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are
openly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations.  It
will give you an interesting perspective on things.)There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous
Indians.  The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and
intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely.  The second is
where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even if
they maintain their tribal identity.  In both of these cases, the tribal
leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological
cases mentioned above.The Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spent
by the tribe per capita.  And the actual reportable income is quite high
when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole.  It is
just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to
ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.  The
poverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic.  This was my
original point.
On a tangent:One thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribal
corporate socialism.  Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate
socialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution.  That they use this
structure at all is an accident of history more than anything.  But what has
interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well
over the long run.  It is like a Family Corporation writ large.It seems that in a future where ""familial"" ties will be increasingly
voluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general Western
society, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with
the included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self-selecting
individuals.Damn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer.-James Rogers

Let's see... a decimal digit is about 3.33 bits, so this is all about moving from a 36-bit to a 46-bit addressing system. Kind of makes the debate about IPv6 spaces quite real, as well as the Auto-ID center at MIT's proposal for a physical markup language. Actual barcode size may yet decline to the point that 2-D codes may yet make it an individual-item level of addressing.Seeing software systems this fantastically brittle after fifty years is not, unfortunately, surprising. Are we sure we really know better yet? Are angle brackets really the key to immortality? :->Interesting reinforcement of the Voyager piece I archived earlier today... RKkhare@alumni.caltech.edu
Bigger Bar Code Inches Up on RetailersAugust 12, 2002
By KATE MURPHY 
 In a little more than two years, retailers in the United
States and Canada will face a deadline that promises
technological challenges akin to the Year 2000 computer
problem. Starting Jan. 1, 2005, the 12-digit bar codes retailers use
to identify everything from cars to candy bars will go to
13 digits. The additional number (and associated bars and
spaces) is enough to make checkout scanners seize up and
make computers crash, perhaps disrupting entire supply
chains. But many retailers have yet to focus on a problem that will
require significant investments in time and capital. ""Most retailers are public companies that tend to live
quarterly and not look ahead, which means they are going to
be hit over the head with this and have to scramble at the
last minute to avert disaster,"" said Thomas Friedman,
president of Retail Systems Research Services, a company in
Newton, Mass., that publishes a retail information
technology newsletter. Leading retailers say they have begun to address the issue.
A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest
retailer, said the company had ""embraced the concept"" of an
expanded bar code, but he did not respond to questions
about actual measures taken to prepare computer databases
and logistical systems. Similarly, a spokesman for the
Target Corporation said his company was ""intellectually
ready"" for the change but refused to comment on whether any
of its stores or warehouses were technologically ready. But Richard A. Galanti, the chief financial officer of
Costco Wholesale, admitted, ""The truth is, given the
timeline, everybody's still in the assessment phase, trying
to figure out what to do."" The difficulty is similar to the one posed by the Year 2000
computer problem, when computer software had to be switched
from two-digit entries identifying years to four-digit
entries. Before Jan. 1, 2000, millions of lines of code had
to be rewritten to avoid widespread computer failures. Bar codes have been used in packaging since 1974, when the
first item, a pack of chewing gum, was scanned at a
supermarket in Ohio. The codes identify a product,
distinguishing between an eight-ounce can of Del Monte
creamed corn and a medium-size pair of Hanes boxer shorts.
When a bar code is scanned, the information in the store's
database lets the retailer assign a price and track sales
and inventory. ""The bar code is the linchpin upon which everything in
retail depends,"" Mr. Friedman said. The reason for expanding the 12-digit bar code, known as
the Universal Product Code, is twofold. First, there is a
shortage of U.P.C. numbers. ""There's only a certain amount
of 12-digit numbers, and we're going to run out,"" said John
Terwilliger, vice president of global markets at the
Universal Code Council, a nonprofit organization based in
Lawrenceville, N.J., that assigns codes in the United
States and Canada. Second, 13-digit bar codes are used
almost everywhere else in the world. The council's European
counterpart, EAN International, based in Brussels, assigns
these numbers, called European Article Numbers, to
companies in 99 nations. ""Right now,"" Mr. Terwilliger said,
""foreign importers have to get a 12-digit U.P.C. to do
business over here, which they haven't been too happy
about."" Foreign manufacturers currently pass on to consumers the
cost of getting an additional bar code and creating special
labels for products sold in the United States and Canada.
""It's an added expense for them, and they have to recoup it
somewhere,"" said Debra Shimkus, marketing manager at the
Chicago Importing Company, a specialty food importer whose
overseas suppliers are often incredulous when they are told
they have to get new bar codes for their products before
they can be sold in American groceries. Many foreign manufacturers decide that it is not worth the
trouble. ""A lot of companies have been unwilling to accept
the additional burden,"" Mr. Terwilliger said, ""and have
stayed out of the market entirely."" American and Canadian exporters have not had the same
obstacle because foreign retailers can easily incorporate a
12-digit number into their 13-digit databases by making the
first digit zero. That is why American and Canadian
manufacturers of products that now have 12-digit codes will
not be affected by the code expansion. A two-liter bottle
of Coca-Cola, for example, will keep the same U.P.C., but a
zero will be added to the beginning of its bar-code number
in retailers' product databases. ""The effect of the change in the U.P.C. code falls squarely
on retailers,"" said Mr. Friedman. He estimates that the
upgrade will cost at least $2 million for a chain of 100
stores with 10 checkout lanes a store. The expense will vary depending on the age of a retailer's
databases, software and hardware and whether it has to hire
outside consultants to make the change. Scanners and other
hardware bought more than three years ago will not read
longer codes and will have to be replaced. Software more
than five years old will also have to be scrapped. ""Thank God we'd already planned to buy new equipment for a
lot of stores this year,"" said Richard S. Gilbert, director
of store systems at Duane Reade, a chain of 200 drugstores
in New York City. The stores have a total of 3,500 scanning
devices, each costing $1,000 to $2,500. As for the
cumbersome database modifications that need to be made, Mr.
Gilbert said: ""Our consultants say they are working on it,
but they haven't gotten back to me with a plan. I still
don't know how big a deal it's all going to be."" He might want to ask John Poss. Mr. Poss is the
merchandising coordinator for Ace Hardware, which has 5,100
stores and sells some 65,000 coded products. Ace overhauled
its computer systems to accept longer bar codes in 1999.
The company, based in Oak Brook, Ill., has retail outlets
in 70 countries and more than a hundred foreign suppliers. ""It was such a struggle to get manufacturers to relabel
things for North America,"" Mr. Poss said, ""and we wanted
the same system in place globally, so we decided to make
the change."" The company hired a consultant, Cognizant Technology
Solutions, which is based in Teaneck, N.J., and is a
division of Dun & Bradstreet. Ace's in-house team worked on
the project during the day while a Cognizant office in
India took over at night. Even so, the project took almost two years to plan and
carry out. In addition to equipment upgrades, modifications
had to be made in more than 500 software programs in
various company divisions (50 in distribution alone). The
most tedious and time-consuming part of the conversion, Mr.
Poss said, was making adjustments to databases. ""Every
database in every division touches bar code information,
and they all needed to be reworked,"" he said. ""It's like
Y2K, where you had to go in and expand fields and find
every reference to the date."" Though Mr. Poss would not disclose the cost of the project,
he said the gains in efficiency and in suppliers' good will
had been ""well worth the expense."" His advice to other
retailers is to ""get busy because you're facing an extreme
challenge."" But moving to 13 digits may not be enough. The Universal
Code Council and EAN International, which formed an
alliance in 1996, strongly advise manufacturers and
retailers to go a step further and prepare their systems to
accommodate a 14-digit code. That is the length of a newly
patented bar code that takes up less space. Its reduced
size means that it can be affixed to small items like loose
produce, and the extra digits let a retailer keep track of
additional data like batch and lot numbers. That additional information would make product recalls
easier. ""Today,"" Mr. Terwilliger said, ""once a product is
taken out of the shipping container in the warehouse, you
really can't track it anymore."" Shipping container bar codes are already 14 digits. The
different bar-code standards mean that retailers need
different computer systems for shipping and receiving,
inventory and sales. By adopting a 14-digit standard,
retailers should be able to put all the information into a
single database. Mr. Poss said Ace had added the capacity to scan and store
14 digits when it made its conversion three years ago. ""Now
we can scan anything,"" he said, ""whether it's in the
warehouse or at the register, and it immediately goes in to
a centralized system. No more sending data between
divisions."" The cost and work of making the transition to 14 digits, he
said, was the same as it would have been for a change to 13
digits. Representatives from the standards groups said adopting a
14-digit structure - a step for which no date has been set
- could help streamline the sharing of data among all parts
of a retail operation. It would also make it possible, they
said, to identify products anywhere in the world at any
time during the trade process. ""And to think it all started with pack of gum,"" Mr. Poss
said. http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/12/technology/12CODE.html?ex=1030208144&ei=1&en=1b5705e7bd2048e6HOW TO ADVERTISE

Date: Not suppliedCarny concessionaires have taken to selling deep-friend Twinkies, doing big 
business with artery-clogging horripilations:     In what may be the biggest setback for the war on fat since supersize 
    fries, Americans are scarfing down thousands of the gooey, calorie-laden 
    snack cakes at county fairs and restaurants across the country.     ""We sold 26,000 Twinkies in 18 days. People drove for hours just to taste

    treats for $3 (U.S.) each at the Payallup Fair, 50 kilometres south of 
    Seattle.     As if Twinkies are not sweet enough already, vendors such as Mr. Mullen add 
    chocolate or berry sauce and sprinkle powdered sugar on top...     Hearing about Mr. Sell's invention, Hostess, the company that makes the 
    71-year-old snack, started promoting deep-fried Twinkies to state and 
    county fairs, where a captive population of junk-food addicts began 
    gobbling them up between pig races and tractor-pull competitions.     How bad are they for your health? After deep-frying, a Twinkie packs an

achieve.  Remember, also, that the AWL will reduce FPs, but its effects aren't 
factored in to the GA scores.The work currently being done on the GA, and comparing different methods of 
doing the score-setting, is very worthwhile, and extremely useful; however, we 
really ought to get a release out, since 2.31 is getting decreasingly useful as 
time goes on.The FP/FN rate of 2.40 with pretty well *any* score-setting mechanism will be 
better than 2.31 -- we can continue with adjusting how the scores are set on the 
2.41 or 2.50 branches.DQ> Something like:

DQ>     for (high = 2; high <= 6; high += 2)
DQ>       evolveYou could just allow low and high to be evolved by the GA (within ranges); I'd 
be enormously surprised if it didn't end up with low=-12 and high=+6, since 
that'd give the GA the broadest lattitude in setting individual scores.  The 
issue with fixing low and high is not one of optimization, but rather one of 
human-based concern that individual scores larger than about +4 are dangerous 
and liable to generate FPs, and individual scores less than -8 are dangerous and 
liable to be forged to generate FNs.DQ> Maybe even add a nybias loop.Adding an nybias loop is not worthwhile -- changing nybias scores will just

to one recent study. Critics say the burgeoning industry is creating
millions of zombified addicts who are turning on and tuning into computer

uncommunicative and even violent because of the electronic games they play.""Game players don't have normal social relationships anymore,"" said Kim Hyun

COCKLES OF ONE'S HEART  You may recall that I was a bit suspicious
of the story I told in last week's issue. James Woodfield pointed
out that there is another possible explanation. In medieval Latin,
the ventricles of the heart were at times called ""cochleae cordis"",
where the second word is derived from ""cor"", heart. Those unversed
in Latin could have misinterpreted ""cochleae"" as ""cockles"". Oddly,
""cochlea"" in Latin means ""snail"" (from the shape of the ventricles
- it's also the name of the spiral cavity of the inner ear), so if
this story is right we should really be speaking of warming the
snails of one's heart.SERRANCIFIED  Many of you supplied your own memories of this odd
expression that I tried to make sense of last week. Taken together,
they show that the expression is best known in Canada and that it
was originally something like ""My sufficiency has been suffonsified
and anything additional would be superfluous"". That form of the
word is the one that is most common in online searches, where the
Canadian focus is also obvious. Cheryl Caesar noted that it appears
in a passage in Margaret Atwood's novel, ""Cat's Eye"": she has two
teenage girls living in Toronto in the 1940s who say, ""Are you
sufficiently sophonisified?"". A Vancouver restaurant reviewer has
the pen name ""Sufficiently Suffonsified"". Oddly, there's also a
1999 record by the Austrian band Cunning Dorx entitled ""Paradigms
Suffonsified"". G H Gordon Paterson suggested that the word might be
a punning blend of ""sufficient"" and ""fancified"". There are some
tantalising suggestions that it may actually be Scots, and not New
World at all.ABSQUATULATE  I have been gently remonstrated with for describing
""sockdologer"" as one of the products of early American linguistic
inventiveness that hasn't survived to the present day. Many people
gave me examples of current or recent use. I stand corrected.
2. Turns of Phrase: Thinspiration
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is one of the key words associated with a deeply disquieting
online trend. In the past couple of years or so a number of Web
sites and chatrooms have appeared which actively promote anorexia
nervosa (known on the sites as ""ana"") and other eating disorders as
lifestyle choices. Since 90% of anorexics are young women, these
""pro-ana"" sites are usually run by and attract that group (one term
sometimes used for them is ""weborexics""). Sites offer suggestions
on how to become and remain thin, often through tips on avoiding
eating, and how to disguise the condition from family and friends.
Other themes sometimes featured on such sites are self-mutilation
(""cutting"") and bulimia (""mia""). Thin women, such as supermodels
and Calista Flockhart, are presented as ""thinspirations"", examples
to emulate. Sites have had names such as Starving for Perfection,
Wasting Away on the Web and Dying To Be Thin. Medical professionals
in the US and UK are deeply concerned about them, because they
accentuate the low self-regard of young women, who are particularly
prone to eating disorders, put their lives at risk, and discourage
them from facing their illness and seeking treatment for it.The Internet is home to a number of pro-eating disorder Web sites -
- places where sufferers can discuss tips, trade low-calorie
recipes and exchange poems and art that may be used as ""triggers""
or so-called ""thinspiration.""
                                         [""Calgary Sun"", Feb. 2002]A new trend among young adults has been sweeping the nation: pro-
anorexia Web sites. Also known as pro-ana, these sites glorify
anorexia nervosa and offer ""thinspiration"" on maintaining a
starvation lifestyle.
                                     [""University Wire"", Apr. 2002]
3. Weird Words: Usufructuary  /ju:zjU'frVktju:@rI/
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A person who has the use or enjoyment of something, especially
property.We are short of words that contain four u's. Among the few that are
even relatively common (leaving aside the Hawaiian ""muu-muu"") are
""tumultuously"" and ""unscrupulous"", although some rare words like
""pustulocrustaceous"" and ""pseudotuberculous"" are also recorded.The term comes from Roman law. ""Usufruct"" is the right of temporary
possession or enjoyment of something that belongs to somebody else,
so far as that can be done without causing damage or changing its
substance. For example, a slave in classical Rome could not own
anything. Things he acquired as the result of his labour he merely
held ""usus (et) fructus"", under ""use (and) enjoyment"" - it was his
master who actually owned them.The term remains in use in modern US legal practice and elsewhere.
These days a ""usufructuary"" can be a trustee who enjoys the income
from property he holds in trust for somebody else. Many Native
American groups hold land on a ""usufruct"" basis, with rights to
enjoy the renewable natural resources of the land for hunting and
fishing.
4. Q&A
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How does the term ""three sheets to the wind"" denote drunkenness?
[Benjamin Weatherston]A. It's a sailor's expression.We ignorant landlubbers might think that a sheet is a sail, but in
traditional sailing-ship days, a ""sheet"" was actually a rope,
particularly one attached to the bottom corner of a sail (it comes
from an Old English term for the corner of a sail). The sheets were
vital, since they trimmed the sail to the wind. If they ran loose,
the sail would flutter about in the wind and the ship would wallow
off its course out of control.Extend this idea to sailors on shore leave, staggering back to the
ship after a good night on the town, well tanked up. The irregular
and uncertain locomotion of the jolly seafarers must have reminded
onlookers of the way a ship moved in which the sheets were loose.
Perhaps one loose sheet might not have been enough to get the image
across, so the saying became ""three sheets to the wind"".Our first written example comes from that recorder of low life,
Pierce Egan, in his ""Real life in London"" of 1821. But it must
surely be much older.                        -----------Q. My East End mother-in-law used to say she was ""well and truly
mogadored"" when she was puzzled by something. Any idea of
derivation and meaning? [Bryan]A. Now that's a bit of British slang I haven't heard in years,
though it is still around (Nanny Ogg uses it in one of Terry
Pratchett's Discworld fantasy stories, I am told). As you say, it
means that somebody is puzzled, confused, or ""all at sea"". It's
also sometimes spelled ""moggadored"", though it doesn't turn up in
print much in either spelling. (No relation to the British word
""moggy"" for a cat, by the way, which seems to be a pet form of
""Margaret"".)The writers of slang dictionaries are decidedly mogadored about its
origin. It looks very much like rhyming slang for ""floored"", which
is likewise slang, meaning dumbfounded or confused. But the dispute
arises over what the root is. Some say it is Irish, from ""magagh"",
to mock, jeer or laugh at, via an unrecorded intermediate form
""mogadÃ³i"".Others suggest that, like some other East End slang terms, it
derives from the Gypsy language Romany (Cockney slang is like
London itself, a melting pot, in which words from many sources are
amalgamated, including Yiddish and old-time forces slang derived
from languages around the world). In this case the source may be
""mokardi"" or ""mokodo"", something tainted (these Romany words also
provide the root for yet another slang phrase, ""to put the mockers
on something"", to jinx it).Sorry not to be able to be more definite!                        -----------Q. I was having an interesting discussion with an American
professor of business studies who also consults to industry. She
was recalling an unbudgeted initiative within a major software
corporate, which the UK managing director described as a ""skunk
project"". I have seen this epithet before, usually in the phrase
""skunk works"", meaning a semi-official project team that is tacitly
licensed to bend the rules and think outside the box. I wonder what
the derivation is? I don't think it can refer to the smelly wild
animal, but neither I think can it refer to the street term for a
strong variant of marijuana. Can you shed any light? [Martin
Hayman]A. We must start in Dogpatch, the fictional place in the backwoods
of upper New York State made famous between 1934 and 1977 as the
home of professional mattress tester Li'l Abner, in the comic strip
written and drawn by Al Capp. The original was actually ""Skonk
Works"", the place where Lonesome Polecat and Hairless Joe brewed
their highly illicit bootleg Kickapoo Joy Juice from ingredients
such as old shoes and dead skunks. (""Skonk"" is a dialect variant of
""skunk"".)We must now move to the very real Burbank, California. In 1943, a
small group of aeronautical engineers working for the then Lockheed
Aircraft Corporation (headed by Clarence ""Kelly"" Johnson) were
given the rush job of creating an entirely new plane from scratch,
the P-80 ""Shooting Star"" jet fighter. This they did in 143 days, 37
days ahead of schedule. Their secret project was housed in a
temporary structure roofed over with an old circus tent, which had
been thrown up next to a smelly plastics factory. The story goes
that one of the engineers answered the phone on a hot summer day
with the phrase ""Skonk Works here"" and the name stuck. It is also
said that Al Capp objected to their use of his term and it was
changed to Skunk Works.One division of the company, formally the Lockheed Martin Advanced
Development Program, is still known as the Skunk Works. The term
has been trademarked by Lockheed Martin, who have been aggressive
in protecting it.As a generic term, it dates from the 1960s. One definition is very
much that of the original and the one you describe: a small group
of experts who drop out of the mainstream of a company's operations
in order to develop some experimental technology or new application
in secrecy or at speed, unhampered by bureaucracy or the strict
application of regulations (Kelly Johnson formulated 14 visionary
rules for running such an operation, which are still regarded as
valid even now). It is also sometimes used for a similar group that
operates semi-illicitly, without top-level official knowledge or
support, though usually with the tacit approval of immediate
management.

"Greetings -I understand you are interested in making some money, and thought
you might be interested in this. A few months back I joined a program and then...promptly forgot
about it. You may have done this yourself sometime...you intend
to work the program but then get caught in your day-to-day
activities and it's soon forgotten.The program was free to join so maybe I just didn't take it very seriously.Anyway, near the end of May I received a letter from my 
sponsor (Vic Patalano) informing me that I had more than 1000 
PAID members in my group! As you can imagine, I was very skeptical. After all, how could I 
have more than 1000 paid members under me in a program that I had
never promoted?I took the time to check out the site...then wrote to Vic asking 
for confirmation that these were paid members and not just free 
sign-ups...like me :)Well, it was true...I had over 1000 paid members in my group. This 
is a program that I had never worked! All I had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end 
of the month and I would have my position locked in and a group of over 1000
 people. You can bet I wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!I can tell you, if I had known what was happening with this program,
 I would have become an active paid member months ago! With this program, you will get a HUGE group of PAID MEMBERS.
My sponsor's check, which is a minimum of $5,000, arrives every
month...on time.How would you like to lock your position in FREE while you check
out this opportunity and watch your group grow?To grab a FREE ID#, simply reply to:  sejr102@yahoo.com
and write this phrase:""Email me details about the club's business and consumer opportunities""
Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)Once I receive your reply, I will submit your information and you 
will receive an e-mail titled ""your name, Activate Your FREE Membership Today!"" You will then need to confirm your FREE Membership.
We will then send you a special report, along with your Free Membership ID Number and also let you know how you can keep track of your growing group, then you can make up your own mind.That's all there is to it.Warm regards,Sean P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.

REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...

program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free

Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire
Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ETWASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online ""anarchist scavenger
hunt"" proposed for next week's annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and
World Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire
of police, who fear demonstrators could damage
property and wreak havoc.Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a
Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.
Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate
executive or World Bank delegate.D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a
congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities
were in talks to decide whether planned protests were,
""so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to
take proactive action.""Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate
outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next
weekend.The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based
anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic
blockade, banner-drops and protests against major
corporations in the downtown core.Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site
www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,
told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.""People were asking for things to do when they come to
D.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so they
don't do the boring, standard stuff,"" he said. ""I
doubt people will actually keep track of what they do
for points.""",Safe Email

agree, EIDE has high density, and EIDE hardware RAID can offer SCSI a

really make a visible difference, given the cost of the iron, and the
rackspace/month. Plus, 1U Dells don't have any space left for lots of EIDE
drives.

  | From: Niall O Broin 
  | 
  | I have about 60G of data which I need to copy from one disk
  | to another.  However, I'm not sure how I should best copy it.
  | The problem is the bulk of the data is images and most of these
  | image have two directory entries i.e. there is a hard link to
  | each file.  If I copy them using cp -a or my usual favourite of
  | find .|cpio -pmd other_dir  it's going to copy each file twice,
  | which is not what I want. dump / restore would take care of this
  | if the source filesystem wasn't reiserfs  :-(  Any suggestions ? do your (and my) favourite, it'll be Ok:  1. cpio(1) preserves hard links, i.e., if F1 and F2 are
     hard-linked and both are ""copied"", then the ""copies""
     are also hard-linked.  this is true of all `cpio's
     (and `tar' and any other decent/usable archival tool,
     by definition (IMHO)).  2. `cpio -p' (at least `GNU cpio version 2.4.2') will only
     read/write (copy) the actual data bytes once.  I _think_
     this is true for all `cpio's (not just that GNU version),
     but am not certain. if you use an intermediate archive, e.g.:    cpio -o ... >file;   ...;   cpio -i ... <file then the actual data bytes are copied into the archive (file)
 under each name (e.g., as both F1 and F2).  but GNU `cpio' is
 smart about this in pass-through mode (`-p'), copying the data
 just once (or so I read the source).cheers!
	-blf-p.s. assuming this is a one-time operation that you won't repeat
    anytime soon (e.g., never; i.e., time isn't a major issue),
    and are not using any intermediate media/file (so storage
    isn't an issue), then even if `cpio' did read the data twice,
    so what? --- as long as, of course, it re-creates the hard
    links.  which it will.--

"" yet it was used after world war ii as a derisory term for people from former japanese colonies , primarily koreans , living in japan . on april 9 , he told members of the ground self - defense forces in tokyo at a ceremony , "" atrocious crimes have been committed repeatedly by sangokujin and ( other ) foreigners who have illegally entered japan . it is to be expected that they will riot in the event of a major disaster . "" although he used the word to refer to those who have illegally entered the country , it had a different meaning from what he meant to say , he said . "" i did not intend to hurt korean or other foreign residents in japan , and i am extremely regretful , "" ishihara said in the statement , promising that he would never again use the "" inappropriate word , "" which is prone to cause misunderstanding . on april 14 , he expressed regret over his remarks , but stopped short of acknowledging the derogatory import of the word "" sangokujin "" and failed to apologize for having hurt the feelings of foreigners . wednesday ' s statement was made in response to demands from metropolitan assembly members of minshuto ( democratic party of japan ) asking that he retract his remarks and make a public apology . ishihara handed the statement to senior minshuto members of the assembly after they held a meeting earlier in the day . the statement , to which ishihara will affix the governor ' s official seal , will become an official document . hidejiro kawai , secretary general of the minshuto group within the assembly , said , "" an official document carries weight , which will be tantamount to the governor ' s withdrawal of his remarks and apology , "" indicating that the group will not take the matter further .",Safe Email

' s shares have fallen 26 percent in the past three days on concern the biggest energy trader ' s dealings with partnerships run by its chief financial officer contributed to investment losses . enron ' s stock dropped 10 percent today . enron ' s board cost the company at least $ 35 million by allowing chief financial officer andrew fastow to manage ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , partnerships that bought enron assets , a shareholder alleged wednesday in a lawsuit . the lawsuit came the day after enron reported $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses from failed investments . the wall street journal reported $ 35 million of the losses were connected with the two limited partnerships . enron also reduced shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from the partnerships , the paper reported yesterday . ` ` it looks sleazy , ' ' said roger hamilton , a manager at john hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 shares . ` ` if you are someone who invests in a company ' s management , it ' s almost time to punt with enron . ' ' enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t return calls or written requests seeking comment . fastow didn ' t immediately return a telephone call for comment . fastow and a handful of associates made more than $ 7 million last year in management fees and about $ 4 million in capital increases on an investment of about $ 3 million in one of the partnerships , the journal reported today . buying enron assets fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies and partnerships that appear to have ties to houston - based enron , based on filings with the texas secretary of state . the foreign business corporations and limited liability companies have directors , officers or managers whose address is listed as 1400 smith street in houston , enron ' s corporate address , according to texas records . fastow is listed as a director , officer or managing member in each one . at least one of the companies bought and sold enron assets , including foreign power plants . whitewing management , which lists fastow as its managing member , received $ 807 million from the sale of enron debt last year . under the terms of the debt sale , whitewing is allowed to use the proceeds to buy power plants from enron or make other ` ` permitted investments . ' ' whitewing has bought 14 enron plants or companies since 1999 and sold four . enron ' s denne has not responded to written requests about fastow ' s role at whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of the value of enron assets to benefit outside investors or company executives at enron ' s expense . shares of enron fell $ 2 . 95 to $ 26 . 05 . they have fallen 69 percent this year . - - russell hubbard in the princeton newsroom , 609 - 750 - 4651 or rhubbard 2 @ bloomberg . net , and jim kennett in houston , ( 713 ) 353 - 4871 or jkennett @ bloomberg . net / pjm / alp / pjm usa : update 1 - enron stock sustains further heavy losses . 10 / 19 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . ( new first paragraph , adds additional analyst comment ) by andrew kelly houston , oct 19 ( reuters ) - enron corp . stock sustained further heavy losses on friday as investor confidence in the former wall street favorite was rocked by reports about the company ' s relationship with a limited partnership that was run until recently by enron ' s chief financial officer . the energy giant ' s stock closed down $ 2 . 95 or 10 . 2 percent at $ 26 . 05 per share , making a cumulative loss of 27 percent for a week in which enron reported a third - quarter loss of $ 638 million , its first quarterly loss in over four years . analysts said confidence was shaken by several articles in the wall street journal this week alleging possible conflicts of interest on the part of chief financial officer andrew fastow , who until recently ran a limited partnership that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from enron . "" i don ' t think this thing passes the smell test , "" said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity . "" i think the cfo should be out of there right now . in the interest of the stockholders , that cfo should be gone , "" he said . enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements , but fastow severed his ties with the ljm 2 partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities . poor judgment ? analysts said that at the very least , the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at enron , which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of high - profile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer jeff skilling in august . "" for a company that had a lot of question marks around it already , these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors , "" said commerzbank securities analyst andre meade . "" it points to poor decision - making on behalf of the board and top management at enron , "" he said . enron , north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity , was one of wall street ' s high flyers last year , when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent . the stock ' s ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company ' s plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its enrononline internet energy trading platform . this year enron ' s shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadband and the internet soured , skilling resigned after only six months as ceo , and the company ' s dabhol power plant project in india became mired in a payments dispute . moody ' s investors service said earlier this week that it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after enron took $ 1 . 01 billion in write - downs and charges that substantially reduced valuations for several non - core businesses , including broadband and water services . some of enron ' s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings . analysts said enron ' s credibility has been severely damaged and the recent reports about the ljm 2 partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant surprises may lie ahead . "" what don ' t we know that went on at that company ? where ' s the credibility ? "" asked one frustrated analyst .

"" good people can always be placed . as long as there is a job to fill and the company has a budget to hire , "" sarah gilley of london - based recruitment group exchange consulting said . "" where the situation starts to get difficult is where everyone is cutting budgets , people are not being replaced when they leave and there have been an awful lot of redundancies . "" last week , scotiamocatta , a subsidiary of the bank of nova scotia and a key ring dealing member , unveiled its decision to give up open outcry trading on the lme floor , prompting around 25 job losses among traders , phone jockeys and clerks . then blue - blooded banker n . m . rothschild & sons closed its london and new york base metals units . it left its core precious metals business intact , but 20 base metals staff were laid off in the process . in the same week , the lme ' s largest floor trader , enron metals , said it planned to cut 10 to 20 percent of its metals staff as part of an exercise to cut 250 to 500 jobs in the enron group . security with three big market players and several major banks with commodities divisions slashing jobs at the same time , competition in the labour market will intensify and those in work are becoming wary about job security . "" what we ' re finding at the moment is that there is still demand for traders with a track record , which is possibly increasing because people are nervous about their jobs and so they ' re keen to stay put , "" gilley said . "" so whereas someone who might be a big money - spinner with a track record would have previously stayed in their job for two to three years , they are now staying for three to five years . "" they probably feel that they ' re reasonably safe where they are , they ' re well recognised and not going to stick their necks out , "" she said . bonus fears october has never traditionally been a strong month for the the jobs market in base metals as players are often distracted by lme week functions and conferences also , traders tend to be looking towards their annual performance - linked bonuses , which are usually announced at the end of the year . "" those who are in work at the moment are sticking . often at this time of year , people are hanging on for their bonuses . but i don ' t think any of them are anticipating good bonuses . they ' re probably just happy to have a job , "" sian griffiths of exchange consulting said . lme volumes traded have been fallen over the past 18 months as the powerful hedge funds that once took a shine to the metals swarmed into areas such as hi - tech and telecomms stocks . metals traders who handled the large volume of fund activity have begun to focus again on moree traditional clients , and this may yet prove a boon for the jobs market . companies are seeking to fill a shortage of staff schooled in the traditional practices of trading physical metal . "" a lot of companies who had sidelined the traditional physical business are now re - aligning their focus and need poeple who understand the physical market and know how to set up a hedge and manage it , "" gilley said . "" the other area where demand has markedly increased in comparison to a few years ago is marketing , "" she added . as for morale in the industry , individuals ' confidence in their future is seemingly undimmed .

   in various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a
   good example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law. - Law suits take time. Between now and conclusion of the first court
   case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes! - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen
   cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc. - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!  I
   don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright.  Also,
   some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example,
   ""pump and dump"" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly
   required for the spammer to get their way.Dan

have a spamtrap that receives Bugtraq messages and you are auto-

after???  Either way automatic reporting is a Bad Thing (tm) IMHO.
You should review and then report spamtrap or otherwise.  I'm not
sure how this would affect your rating because I don't have any docs
nor code to look at but I sincerely hope that if that's what you
are doing that it negatively impacts your rating at a near exponential

"workshop announcement articulatory databases workshop on articulatory databases munich thursday 25th and friday 26th may , 1995 we are currently starting the preparations for a two-day workshop on articulatory databases . this will be the third in the series of workshops organized by the accor working group ( a consortium of phonetic institutes financed by the european community 's esprit programme ) and and follows the electromagnetic articulography meeting in munich ( april , 1992 ) , and the tongue modelling meeting in barcelona ( december 1993 ) . a few words on the aims of a meeting devoted to such an apparently dry topic : the basic premise is that the free availability of articulatory data could provide benefits in several partly overlapping areas : in basic research it could allow investigators to test hypotheses formulated in articulatory terms on a much wider range of data than the individual worker would normally be able to acquire or access unaided . it could promote the development and testing of algorithms for deriving articulatory representations from acoustic data - relevant both for basic understanding of speech production as well as in potential applications such as speech displays for training the speech impaired . it could promote the development and testing of algorithms for speech synthesis / recognition using an articulatory level of representation . the aim of the workshop would be to generate an exchange of ideas among people active in these areas in order to identify , for example ( further suggestions welcome ) : 1 ) what articulatory data is in existence that it would be beneficial to make more freely available ( archival / retrospective approach ) ? 2 ) what standards should freely available data meet ? - specification of recording conditions - anatomical frames of reference - levels of accuracy / reliability - linguistic specification of the speech samples - preferred data structures for distribution . - any other issues relevant to the data being used without risk of misinterpretation by people not actually involved in the the details of acquisition articulatory data can come in many guises depending on the speech subsystem tapped into and the transduction technique used . thus , it is possible to monitor position ( 1 , 2 or 3 dimensions ) , force , emg , airpressure / flow with techniques that may be static or dynamic , may involve imaging or point-tracking etc . etc . we think that people directly involved in acquisition can also benefit from considering how techniques can be standardized to promote maximum comparability of recordings made at different sites and with different hardware . 3 ) in analogy to acoustic databases ( where unlabelled data is of only the most limited use ) , what segmentation and labelling information ( and tools for the exploitation thereof ) could / should be made available with the raw data to facilitate flexible access for different purposes ? 4 ) for future recordings , what categories of data and corpora would be potentially of most widespread use ? if you are interested in participating please contact phil hoole ( preferably by email ) at the address below as soon as possible . further information on registration and format for presentations will be distributed early in 1995 . please also draw this letter to the attention of any colleagues you think might be interested . phil hoole and hans tillmann institut fuer phonetik munich university schellingstr . 3 d - 80799 munich germany fax : + 49 89 2800362 email : hoole @ sun1 . phonetik . uni-muenchen . de",Safe Email

"query : pseudo - explanations i am trying to collect examples of pseudo-explanations of linguistic phenomena which invoke supposed beliefs or customs such as the following : ( a ) hopi pluralizes the word for ' cloud ' the way that it usually pluralizes only animate nouns , so whorf claimed that this proves that the hopis believe clouds to be alive , ( b ) malagasy and some other languages tend to use passive rather than active voice forms in imperatives , so it is has often been claimed ( i even did this myself once ) that this is a matter of politeness , because by using a passive you are avoiding actually ordering the addressing around , while still making it clear what you want done . ( c ) one of the languages of the torres straits uses the dual in speaking to a married woman , and this was explained by saying that a married woman was assumed to have a child with her ! ! ! ( d ) there is even the famous case of a russian work which claimed that the adjective * beremennyj * ' pregnant ' had no masculine forms ( like the one i just cited ) because only females can get pregnant and then used this very form , saying that a "" beremennyj muzhchina "" ( = "" pregnant - masc man "" ) is inconceivable ! these are the kinds of things i would like to collect . and it would be especially if there were a case where the explanation was valid and not pseudo , of course , please send the examples to me and i will post a summary .",Safe Email

"Anyone interested in a pgp/gpg key-signing get-together @ DC,
please email me your key info (name, key ID, type, size,
fingerprint), and I will add you to the list.If you don't have a PGP key, now is a great time to make one.Want to find out more about PGP?
You can get the software from:PGPfreeware 
GnuPG (GPG) 
Bring the following:   *  Photo ID (your name must be in your key identity)
   *  A printed copy of your key ID, key type, fingerprint, and key sizeI will pass out a master list (from what people send me now). Then
individually we will cross-validate eachothers identities and keys.It works like this: person A tells B the details of their key (from
their personal copy of the key info). Person B confirms that the key
information on the master list matches. Next person A produces photo ID
for person B. If it proves that person A is the owner of the key, then
person B can check off that person on their list.The reverse is then done for person B.After a while you will end up with a list full of (hopefully) checked
names. Later on, you can retrieve a copy of the key either from a
keyserver or directly from the owner, verify it's valid (it matches the
checked off name on your copy of the master list), and sign it using
your private key.Then you can upload your signature of the key to a key server and send a
copy back to the key's owner to add to thier keyring.ID:    Mark Renouf

here is the latest in what I'm seeing...* Even knowing a CTO/CEO/CFO may not even get your resume looked at, the
feedback I'm getting is that hiring managers are only considering family
and extended family for jobs - everyone has plenty of unemployed relatives.* Most job sites are now almost empty - so the practice of posting ""resume
bait"" jobs is coming to an end. The postings they do have are months old
bait. This is now a completely pointless way to look for a job.* We're almost flatlne in jobs created for several months, where population
growth needs about 120k jobs a month to keep things steady.* Unemployment rates are only staying steady becasue people drop out of the
workforce number after they cant find a job for a long time. The ""not in
labor force"" is rising 400k a month. International numbers are no better -
technology is replacing people, especially the people tha tmake the
technoogy.* Grad school programs are stuffed full of people for every non-tech major.
Colleges are having big headaches dealing with all the day-job refugees.* Spam for porn, ink, and stocks has dropped off, spam (the english ones I
see subject lines for) now seems to be dominated by work-at-home scams and
resume services. That's got to be a BAD sign.* FoRK is now almost all spam, somebody fix the damn subscriber-only-posting

"resource logics and minimalist grammars esslli ` 99 workshop on resource logics and minimalist grammars ( deadline for submissions : march 15th 1999 ) utrecht , 16-20 august 1999 organizers : christian retor ( irisa , rennes ) edward stabler ( ucla , los angeles ) url : http : / / www . irisa . fr / rlmg e - mail : rlmg @ irisa . fr a workshop held as part of the 11th european summer school in logic , language and information ( esslli ` 99 ) , august 9-20 1999 , utrecht first call for papers esslli ` 99 : the main focus of the european summer schools in logic , language and information is the interface between linguistics , logic and computation . it is organized under the auspices of the european association for logic , language and information ( folli ) . foundational , introductory and advanced courses together with workshops cover a wide variety of topics within six areas of interest : logic , computation , language , logic and computation , computation and language , language and logic . previous summer schools have been highly successful , attracting around 500 students from europe and elsewhere . the school has developed into an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and researchers interested in the interdisciplinary study of logic , language and information . esslli-99 will take place at the university of utrecht , the netherlands , august 9-20 . in its second week it will feature a worskshop on resource logics and minimalist grammars . its aim is to provide a forum for advanced ph . d . students and other researchers to present and discuss their work on the connection between minimalist grammars and resource logics . workshop background : there has been a growing interest in connections between resource-logical theories of grammar and the minimalist grammars of the transformational tradition in syntax . a good understanding of these connections will reveal substantial differences that can be debated , and the prospects also look good for identifying a valuable common ground . in particular , the rich descriptive tradition of transformational theory may become more accessible to resource-logical frameworks , and the relatively well-understood mathematical foundations of resource-logical frameworks may stimulate a more sophisticated understanding of the mechanisms of minimalist grammars . linear logic is a neat and well studied logic from a proof theoretical perspective which is able to handle both logic for syntax ( like the lambek calculus ) and logic for semantics ( like intuitionistic logic ) , and it also appears to be a sensible framework for a logical treatment of minimalist grammars . this workshop aims to bring together phd students and other researchers in the respective traditions to explore these developments . topics of interest include but are not limited to : * applications of linear logic , multimodal categorial logic , and other resource logics to linguistic problems * formal and computational studies of minimalist and other generative grammars * studies of linguistic semantics from the perspective of either tradition * assessments of the common ground and differences among these approaches to language workshop aims : this workshop aims to : * provide a setting for researchers from various traditions to present and discuss recent work on resource logics and minimalist grammars * facilitate the exchange of ideas between researchers working in these respective areas * foster a spirit of collaborative research call for papers : researchers in the area , including phd students and young researchers , are invited to submit short papers ( between 8 and 12 pages long ) describing their thesis / research topic , approach and results . talks will be 20 minutes long , with 10 minutes for discussion / questions . authors are also encouraged to submit a list of topics they would like to see discussed at the workshop . this will help to identify issues for discussion and debate . deadline for submissions : march 15 , 1999 submissions should be sent to : rlmg @ irisa . fr submissions will be accepted in the form of either postscript or self-contained latex . authors of accepted papers will be notified by may 1st 1998 . the deadline for receipt of revised papers to appear in the workshop proceedings is june 1st 1998 . workshop format : the workshop will consist of five sessions of 90 minutes each held over five days . there will be either two or three presentations at each session with time for questions and discussion . it is hoped to have at least one invited paper from a senior researcher working in the field . publication : after the workshop , authors will have the opportunity to submit papers for possible publication in the new electronic journal "" language and computation "" ( http : / / www . dcs . kcl . ac . uk / journals / jlac / ) , which is supported by oxford university press . there will be more details in the next announcement . registration : workshop contributors will be required to register for esslli-99 . important dates : march 15th , 99 : deadline for

"syllable structure and gesture timing call for papers : syllable stucture and gesture timing as part of the conference lp ' 98 to be held at ohio state university sept . 15-20 , there will be a workshop funded by the national science foundation sept . 19-20 , on ' syllable structure and gesture timing ' , covering issues related to phonetic and phonological accounts of segmentation , and timing and ordering of gestures in speech , especially how sequences of consonants e . g . [ spr ] , [ ntw ] are formally represented . speech is traditionally represented as a string of segments , defined in terms of features which are implemented simultaneously . in that conception , the phoneme is the minimal phonological unit where time and ordering are defined . as has long been known , the transition from phoneme to phoneme is phonetically realized as a continuous change . there has been a steady progression in phonological theory from linear generative theory to nonlinear representations where the mapping between segments and features is quite relaxed , and highly articulated suprasegmental structures are assumed . a consequence of nonlinear models , which allow single 's egments ' to bear multiple values of a feature and allow one feature to be associated with many 's egments ' , is that one can meaningfully question the existence of the 's egment ' as a formal object . the theory of feature geometry does not explicitly represent the notion 's egment ' , and it has been argued that the traditional segment does not correspond to any specific level of representation in current models . nonlinear models have increasingly tended towards positing complex but internally timeless single 's egments ' in place of clusters of segments : thus , what was formerly represented as a triconsonantal sequence [ ntw ] might also be represented as a single segment , a ' voiceless prenasalised rounded alveolar ' . some languages , such as bella coola and georgian , seem to allow unbounded arbitrary sequences of consonants , which suggests that phonological theory may ultimately need to allow infinitely long syllables and unstructured onsets and codas . one of the central questions to be taken up in the workshop is "" are there any universal limits on possible strings of segments in various positions within the syllable "" ? this statement of the question begs two quite important questions : do segments per se exist ( and how can one identify whether a given temporal stretch of the phonetic output corresponds to one or more segments ) , and do syllables themselves exist ? both of these assumptions remain controversial , especially in nonlinear phonology . invited speakers for this workshop include donca steriade , john ohala , john harris and louis goldstein . further details on the issues being investigated in this workshop can be found at http : / / ling . ohio-state . edu / events / phon _ workshop . html . one - page abstracts for 30 minute papers to be presented at this workshop are solicited ( due date for receipt of abstracts : august 10 ) . lodging and up to $ 400 to cover economy travel expenses will be provided to authors presenting papers at the workshop . abstracts may be sent by email to odden @ ling . ohio-state . edu , or by surface mail to : syllable workshop department of linguistics ohio state university columbus , oh 43210 please include a surface mail address , email address , and phone number .",Safe Email

"a few questions for you hi louise hope all is well and that your trip to and from london went smoothly ! a few questions : 1 . does enron have a system which collects data by customer ? we have something called cmis which we use for these purposes and which i believe we will need to integrate into the infrastructure if you don ' t have something already . we usually need customer info for reg reporting purposes . 2 . bob dinerstein believes it would be prudent to have a seminar of sorts whereat the heads of gas and power trading present to key ubsw people what their businesses are all about , example trade flows , competitive pressures , key reg reporting requirements , etc . he would also anticipate having our outside counsel participate to discuss what they understand to be the developing regulations in these markets . the thought is to try and do this on thursday because so many ubsw people will be on the ground in houston for the simulation exercise . i don ' t know that i am wedded to that day and i am a bit unsure about whether this makes sense given it may interfere with progress on integration but this day may work since alot of people will already be there and i am sure the traders will not be interested in doing anything like this once they start trading . what do you think ? the audience would include key logistics personnel from ubsw and enron and anyone else you thought appropriate . spoke with mike about it and he is fine . 3 . having ubsw paraphenalia sent down - toys , shirts , etc . , should be arriving by no later than tuesday . if you haven ' t received anything by late on monday could you let me know so i can track down . ubsw and ubsw energy banners are being made to hang from the ceiling on both trading floors - they should arrive by wed . 4 . was thinking perhaps we should have a celebration on the floor on friday to commemorate the closing . what do you think ? 5 . i am planning to be down in houston for most of next week . i thought it would be helpful to be on site in order to be available to address issues as they arise in order to meet closing on friday . i will be leaving on a late monday flight and returning on a late afternoon friday flight . i hope you think this will be useful . please let me know otherwise . sorry for the long message . please feel free to call me at home or on my cell if you have any questions , issues , would like to discuss h 914 764 4597 c 917 523 6132 . colette visit our website at http : / / www . ubswarburg . com this message contains confidential information and is intended only for the individual named . if you are not the named addressee you should not disseminate , distribute or copy this e - mail . please notify the sender immediately by e - mail if you have received this e - mail by mistake and delete this e - mail from your system . e - mail transmission cannot be guaranteed to be secure or error - free as information could be intercepted , corrupted , lost , destroyed , arrive late or incomplete , or contain viruses . the sender therefore does not accept liability for any errors or omissions in the contents of this message which arise as a result of e - mail transmission . if verification is required please request a hard - copy version . this message is provided for informational purposes and should not be construed as a solicitation or offer to buy or sell any securities or related financial instruments .",Safe Email

While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000 miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, ...** (Comment: Just because the RMI government ""...has condemned the 'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio..."", does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) **...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island),...** (Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a ""sister nation"" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and the same could be said for DOM. **...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, ""...an article in Agence France-Presse"" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an ""...investment scam..."". We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) **The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** (Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no ""fraudulent claims"" of which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any ""..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..."" nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s.** (Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.) Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and 6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the people's behalf. **The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an ""agreement""? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. SKIP TO NEXT FILE ï¿½TOP OF PAGE June 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio' correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. ""Fantasy Island"" -- ""Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers"" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December 10, 1998: ""Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,"" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands."" http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24, 1998: ""Fantasy Island"", disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the ""Melchizedek press release"" you cited, indicating that ""...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,..."". Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is ""...another only-in- cyberspace country..."", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. SKIP TO NEXT FILE ï¿½TOP OF PAGE June 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00). ""Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally. The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek."" Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: **In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.** Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: ""Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory."" **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and, having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll. The Author responds: ""I don't see much conflict between the two versions here."" **The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: ""I will note this."" **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. The Author responds: ""I will make the necessary corrections here."" **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.** Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. The Author responds: ""I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response, Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so."" (June 7, 1999) SKIP TO NEXT FILE ï¿½TOP OF PAGE June 1, 1999: News Release Part One Background: On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a ""press release"" on the Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, ""Mr. Joseph Biglar, Undersecretary"", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said ""press release"" is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called ""Press Release"": This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report) This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio: ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign, Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ was established by way of a public authority, the Constitution of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as - now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - ""RMI geographical and political boundaries."" ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI Constitution), upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its political jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall Islands: ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign governments, which included the United States, China and the USSR. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ was also established under a public authority, the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, ratified in 1979 by its people. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr. Biglar. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which was not incorporated into the RMI in 1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution, which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom of EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of Iroijlaplap Hermios, and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap Hermios. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility, existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom, His Majesty King Remios, as Head of State, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures. Furthermore, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom of EnenKio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, then you decide for yourself: ""With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal."" On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

[Paragraph 4] Thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more ""remote"" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice."" [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof. The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of ""ethnic cleansing"" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less.

SKIP TO NEXT FILE ï¿½TOP OF PAGE March 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Subject: A ""State of War"" Declaration The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the United States Government.ï¿½ï¿½ The United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in ""taking possession"" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State, which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.ï¿½ï¿½ The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese.ï¿½ï¿½ Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not healed. Thus a current state of adversity exists.ï¿½ï¿½ Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese King, issued the ""'State of War', a Declaration"" and broadcast it to the world.ï¿½ï¿½ The people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out.ï¿½ï¿½ It was through this pragmatic initiative that the Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios. In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.ï¿½ï¿½ While a state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.ï¿½ï¿½ The Kingdom of EnenKio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.ï¿½ï¿½ Such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.ï¿½ï¿½ The Kingdom of EnenKio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the Marshallese people. While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter, conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.ï¿½ï¿½ The refusal of the U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.ï¿½ï¿½ Your understanding is appreciated.ï¿½ï¿½ SKIP TO NEXT FILE ï¿½TOP OF PAGE December 19, 1998: News Release Subject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio The government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999. Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head of State. HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the United States. In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official Internet site. On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to all in Peace. News Article SKIP TO NEXT FILE ï¿½TOP OF PAGE July 14, 1998: Communiquï¿½ï¿½ to Correspondents Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands government warning against ""fraudulent claims"". We have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply: The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual ""state of war"" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations. The Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) ""asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries..."" of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue be played out in the People's venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d'ï¿½ï¿½tre is clearly mandated in the Preamble to the Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org Referencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled ""Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand,"" of May 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary, our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such an act is patently illegal. The published statement, ""The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain..."", is wholly false. I have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not ""created"" by Robert Moore and he is not a ""Honolulu-based attorney."" HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. ""Enenkio"" [sic] (actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. ""Wake"" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society writers. SKIP TO NEXT FILE ï¿½TOP OF PAGE May 4, 1997: News Release Subject: Issuance of Gold Stamps The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997. First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official ""First Day of Issue"" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint mailing list. BACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the Kingdom lingers in ""exile"". Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA and elsewhere. A NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to ""Wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy. ""STATE OF WAR"" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual ""state of war"" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government. INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money. CLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the ""state of war"" with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom and end the conflict in peace. SKIP TO NEXT FILE ï¿½TOP OF PAGE March 31, 1997: News Release An official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts that: ""A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES."" This is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the United States. The land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by ""Western explorers"" for Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was destined to become a military installation. However, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA (predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the ""natives"" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the Marshall group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was, the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public. Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title. The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership. Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration, ""yields to the recognition that a State of War"" exists over the island nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of U.S. ""ownership"" and occupation. Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. In the Declaration, demands are made as follows: ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ""...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR..."". ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ""If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens."" ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ""...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and every action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone..."" ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ""...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ""...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay."" ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ That the ""...Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process..."". The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly. Appeals are being made to the United Nations. News Article SKIP TO NEXT FILE ï¿½TOP OF PAGE February 6, 1995: News Release On behalf of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, Monarch of EnenKio Atoll, titular head of State, Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall Islands, I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe! The purpose of this notice is twofold: First, to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to take action; Second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. Summary of Events 1993-94: Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii said in articles published New Year's Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994; 2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island; part of the ""star wars"" program, I am led to believe. An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army's so-called ""no significant impact"" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims. On March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr. Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution, Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted. On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government. Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others. Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council. On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million. The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly. Request for Media Response: The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of ""world leadership""? Or is it world domination? People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage: 1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.) 2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my understanding Wake was ""decommissioned"" after the so-called ""processing"" of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s). 3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind. 4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner. 5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note: Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.) 6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens.) Parting Shot: What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government. Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western ""civilized"" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of ""manifest destiny"" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of American attempts at ""fixing up the world"". The title of ownership and inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual rights. Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry. TOP OF PAGE November 21, 1994: News Release In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899. The legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S. claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile. Eneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC. During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy. King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll. Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii. Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: ""Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island"" and stated: ""Not much activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control"". According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people. Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council. Since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios: ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was ""decommissioned"" more than a decade ago. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise ignored. After waiting for more than 580 days since ""formal"" notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council. They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio . While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace. Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States. Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S. Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese ""natural"" rights, including those of ownership and use of land. Still mindful of the terrible threat of extraordinary U.S. military 1 808 923-0476 fax/phone Robert Moore, Minister Plenipotentiary, Kingdom of EnenKio Foreign Trade Mission DO-MO-CO Manager, Remios Hermios Eleemosynary Trust, Majuro, Marshall Islands http://www.enenkio.org",Phishing Email
"your help needed please - cross - commodity reporting please excuse the long e - mail below - i knew we ' d never get a chance to all get together , and this is somewhat urgent as i have to complete the finance committee presentation for the upcoming bod meeting by the end of next week , and it will include trading results for the lst quarter , reported in accordance with the risk management policy . due to issues noted below , this may require immediate attention by your staff as we have a few short days to come up with the best quality numbers we can . i talked to beth already , and mrm met with chris abel ' s group to see if there was a short cut , but our joint conclusion was that the business unit controllers need to be involved in this process as you are the experts on your businesses and can apply the best judgment to decide on the trading results to be reported to the bod . we ' ll probably need to go with our best estimate of 3 / 30 # s as of end of the day next tuesday or wednesday at the latest . as you recall , the february 12 th bod meeting resulted in a clarification that the bod approved trading limits were limits on the generic commodity groups defined , and accordingly the trading results must be reported consistent with that limit structure ( management reporting can be different of course ) . chris abel ' s global energy operations group has prepared a "" rac "" dpr that attempts to aggregate the commodity groups in accordance with the risk management policy , so that top management and the bod can see enron ' s exposure to individual commodities on a consolidated basis . ( a ) this dpr will not impact actual sharing of p / l from a management reporting / business unit perspective - this is purely for market risk management purposes and reporting to the bod . but commercial management will need to review and sign off on the rac dpr and monitor limits accordingly , as these limits are at an enron level . the specific trading results we need for the bod presentation are the first quarter p / l and average daily var , by commodity group . the first rac dpr available is as of 3 / 30 - so while it has cumulative p / l , var is only as of 3 / 30 . ( note - we ' re also comparing to lq 2000 , but we ' re not going to attempt to resolve cross - commodity reporting for that period except at a high level ) . your participation is needed in resolving : 1 ) cross - commodity reporting per the new rac dpr - both retroactively for the lst quarter , and going forward , and 2 ) rovar ( return on average daily var by commodity group ) for the lst quarter . this aggregation of cross - commodity activity has been completed by chris as of 3 / 30 , so he has what he believes to be p / l aggregated for the quarter in accordance with the policy . what we don ' t have is var on a daily basis as the first time it was calculated on an aggregated basis was on 3 / 30 . obviously we ' re not going to be able to go back and calculate daily var for the entire quarter by commodity group aggregated in this new manner - especially within a week . so it appears we ' ll need to "" swag "" average daily var - by reviewing the cross commodity positions aggregated at 3 / 30 , by considering cross - commodity activity you ' re aware of that took place throughout the quarter , and using our best estimate of the impact on var for this cross commodity activity . due to this adjustment in historical reporting practices , we feel a certain level of due diligence is required for us to feel confident we ' re reporting to the bod in accordance with the policy . and since we only have a few days , i thought a team approach to tackling the review would facilitate a prompt resolution of material issues , and then you and chris ' group can work out your processes and procedures on how to handle going forward as you see fit . when you consider materiality , please involve your market risk contact - while a transaction / position / book may not be material to gas or power , it may be material to global products , weather , etc . . would you please help us with the following : ? confirm your review of chris ' aggregation on the rac dpr at 3 / 30 ( chris ' staff can walk you through ) ? are all the cross - commodity positions you ' re aware of being reported correctly ? ? is there other cross - commodity activity not present at 3 / 30 and consequently not aggregated for the quarter ' s results , but actually present during the first quarter and material ? if so , estimate impact on p / l and average daily var . ? we ' re not expecting an exhaustive search or analysis - perhaps you can simply discuss this issue with the traders who handle this type of activity to get a feel , and if they point on specific material transactions , we can address those ; you can determine best approach ? are there certain books in risktrac that have cross - commodity positions imbedded / combined - either held currently or those that generated significant var or p / l during the quarter ? going forward these will need to be reported separately to facilitate risk reporting , but in the next week what we need is an estimate of the impact on the corresponding commodities , or a conclusion that the impact is immaterial . ? once you ' ve reviewed the summary of cross commodity activity per the rac dpr and per your own knowledge , help us estimate the impact on the respective commodities ' average daily var for the quarter - you can discuss with your market risk contact your recommendation on a reasonable "" swag "" approach . after considering the information above , please provide your assessment on whether you are in fact able to capture and report all the cross - commodity activity , and if not , identify the issues involved and whether it is something that market risk needs to address , or if it will simply take more time to resolve the reporting details . if you have other recommendations on how to get comfortable with the trading results for the quarter , please feel free to pursue those . i do not mean to imply i know how to do your jobs , or that you ' re not doing them - i simply want to coordinate with you to ensure the # s we report to the bod are the numbers you agree with , and that if they ' re not completely accurate given recent implementation , that we are able to articulate and estimate the potential misstatement , if any . as you are the experts on your businesses ' results , i simply wanted to make sure i closed the loop with what we in mrm understand regarding your reporting of the cross - commodity activity and trading results and the application of the policy . on a separate note , we need you to identify p / l related to special transactions that flowed through the dpr , but do not really represent trading activity - examples in the past are sfas 125 transactions and other unique gain / loss events - we ' re reporting lq 2001 and lq 2000 , so whatever we can recall about last year will also be considered . we will be sending you a reconciliation from the dpr to the bod package that we use to document any special adjustments , and will discuss this with you to come to an agreement on adjustments to the dpr reporting to derive true trading activity . these adjustments should be minimal , but we ' d like your input to conclude . thank you for your cooperation , regards , cassandra schultz x 30429 713 858 2618 cell 936 321 2185 home ( a ) for example , north american electricity limits represent enron ' s consolidated na electricity trading activity , without regard to which business unit or commodity group actually executes the trades or holds positions . so if power has some gas positions for hedges or other reasons , these gas trades need to be removed from power var and p / l and combined with gas ' var and p / l , etc . . heating oil positions held outside global products should be aggregated with global products ; global products ' positions in gas and power should be aggregated with gas and power , with corresponding adjustment to global products ' results .",Safe Email

"synthetic compounds summary dear colleagues , in april i sent a query to linguist about synthetic compounds . i received over 30 replies . i have tried to respond personally to all of the replies , but a couple of my messages bounced . i apologize to anyone i missed . i appreciated all of the response i received . i am proud to be a part of intellectual community where so many people are eager to share their hard won knowledge . a summary of what i have learned follows . it can be divided into four parts . part 1 presents some questions about what i had taken as given in my initial query . part 2 consists of a bibliography of works that i and others have found useful in our research on compounds . part 3 . is a table showing the data i have so far . i encourage you to look over it may surprise you or you may disagree with what i say about your favorite language ( if you do please write me , i know very little about most of these languages and have no way of judging if what i have read about them is the widely accepted view . in part 4 i explain the project i am currently working on and make yet another call for data ( no matter how much i get i want more ) . i hope that this summary is useful for most of you and interesting to at least some . part 1 : i got some very interesting replies to my query which instead of or in addition to offering data , questioned the very notion of synthetic compounds that i had based my query on . my post was as follows : i am looking for information on synthetic compounds like the english "" truck driver "" and the french "" essuie-glace "" where one element of the compound is a verbal and the other element is interpreted as its object . i am trying to find out if there is any connection between the ordering of the elements in these compounds and the ordering of the elements in a vp . i already have information on how these compounds are formed and used in english , french , spanish , italian , dutch , igbo , and jacaltec , but have been unable , despite hours in the library , to find information on other languages . the questions fell into two main categories ? 1 . what did i mean by "" synthetic "" compounds ? on the surface this seems like a simple terminological question but it goes much deeper than that . in researching this type of compounds i have seen them called by any number of names ; deverbals , verbals , v + n , v + o , nominalizations . . . . . i do n't know where the term "" synthetic "" comes from i just use it because it was the one i was taught . each of these terms has its own merits and faults and reflects the theory of compounding the user ascribes to , which is all well and good but it makes research in this area very difficult . another problem arising in part from or simply reflected in the plethora of terms for this type of compounds is the fact that no two linguists define the group in the same way . for some a synthetic compound can only be made up of a verbal and noun that can be interpreted as its direct object ( dishwasher , face painting ) for others the noun can be an oblique object as well ( theater goer ) and other will call any compound with a verbal element a synthetic ( examining room ) . for the purposes of my current work i am only interested in the first type ( v + do ) , in fact only the subset where the compound is understood to be a person or object that preforms the action ie . a dishwasher : something / one that washes dishes . 2 . why did i think that "" driver "" of "" truck driver "" was a "" verb "" it is obviously a "" noun "" ? why was n't i looking at the ordering of nps instead of that of vps ? admittedly at first glance the compound "" truck driver "" does seem to be made up of two nouns "" truck "" and "" driver "" . in fact i cannot at this point think of any compelling argument against this view except that words like "" driver "" tend to be semantically weak and except in a few case like that of "" driver "" unless they appear as part of a compound they have no meaning out of context . compare "" grower "" with "" apple grower "" . the french compounds present even better support for the verb based view . the "" essuie "" of "" essuie-glace "" ( windshield-wiper ) is a straight forward verb form . there is no french noun "" essuie "" ( * wiper ) thus french synthetics at least cannot be n + n compounds , and if we want a unified theory of synthetics then english synthetics cannot be n + n either . if you want to comment on either of these questions , please do so directly to linguist . i think either of them could lead to a good general debate and i have already said all i have to say about these subjects at the moment . part 2 : synthetic compound bibliography ( warning some citations are incomplete , i hope this does n't cause anyone too much trouble ) adams , valerie . an introduction to modern english word - formation . new york : longman bauer , laurie . english word formation . cambridge : cambridge university press ( 1983 ) - - - . the grammar of nominal compounding : with special reference to danish , english , and french . odense : odense university press , ( 1978 ) . beard , robert . lexeme - morpheme base morphology . suny press ( this summer ) booij , g . and t . van haaften .

"" he ( nom ) wipes ( 3rd sing pres ) the ( fem sing ) glass ( fem sing ) ? elle porte la parole . "" she ( nom ) carries ( 3rd sing pres ) the ( fem sing ) speech ( fem sing ) . les essuie-glaces ( pl ) no fem exists les porte-paroles ( pl ) la porte-parole ( fem ) this pattern is very productive in french especially with - er verbs . these compounds are always masculine regardless of the gender of the nominal element . "" essuie "" and "" porte "" independently can only be interpreted as verb stems of 3rd singular pres . they cannot be used as nouns or adjectives . phillipe barbaud at universite du quebec a montreal wrote a nice paper ( the name of which escapes me ) on french compounds in the late 80 's thanks again to all those who replied to my first query . i hope this summary has been of some use . heather anderson hmanders @ indiana . edu 322 memorial hall iu bloomington , in 47405",Safe Email

SIBERIA BOUND
Chasing the American Dream On Russia's Wild Frontier
By Alexander Blakely
Sourcebooks. 320 pp. $22.95Judging from Siberia Bound, Alexander Blakely seems like a pretty cool 
guy -- adventurous, engaging and fun to hang out with. After all, most 
chroniclers of Russian life base their tales in Moscow or, alternately, 
St. Petersburg, the most livable of Russia's not-very-livable cities. 
Deciding instead to settle in a former academic community outside of 
Novosibirsk, one of Siberia's major cities, Blakely set out to pursue, 
as his book's subtitle declares, ""the American dream on Russia's wild 
frontier.""Blakely, who moved to Siberia after finishing college with an economics 
degree, has a breezy writing style. And although his book is flawed in 
many respects, it does include some sharp observations of life in 
Russia. ""Usually with construction,"" he tells us, for instance, ""you 
have two choices: 1) you can do it quickly, or 2) you can do it right. 
The Soviet construction worker . . . takes his time doing things wrong.""Anyone who has spent time in Siberia knows that its inhabitants are a 
breed apart. They disdain their compatriots in the country's Western 
regions and pride themselves -- perhaps excessively -- on their courage, 
strength and inner fortitude. Siberia, in fact, occupies a space in the 
Russian national psyche similar to that of the Wild West in American 
mythology. The efforts throughout the 16th and 17th centuries to settle 
Siberia's vast expanse and exploit its natural resources still resonate 
with Russians. So does the region's role as a convenient dumping ground 
for criminals and political dissidents during the czarist centuries and 
as home to the cruel network of gulags in Soviet times.Unfortunately, little of this rich brew of history and myth makes an 
appearance in Siberia Bound. Neither do lots of other pertinent facts. 
Russians often say that, in Russia, anything can happen -- and usually 
does. So it's easy to believe that two young men could establish a 
chocolate business on little more than hope, smarts and chutzpah. But 
while Blakely describes establishing a cocoa-bean importing business 
with his friend Sasha, we never learn how they met in the first place or 
why he believes Sasha to be a trustworthy associate. The two of them 
strike a deal to sell their beans to a local chocolate factory, yet we 
find out virtually nothing about the chocolate the factory produces. Is 
it tasty? Disgusting? Are we talking chocolate bars, chocolate truffles 
or chocolate syrup? A few details would go a long way here.The author has the makings of a terrific story. But even though Siberia 
Bound includes frequent humorous episodes, Blakely generally fails to 
transform the pungent ingredients into a satisfying meal. The constant 
descriptions of encounters and conversations ultimately differ little 
from one another. People are forever winking, smirking and slapping one 
another on the back. Slamming down shots of vodka and making sentimental 
toasts to women and friendship play an inevitable role in any account of 
Russian life, but reading about such occasions becomes tiresome after 
the 20th or 30th repetition.Blakely is also given to facile comments that are meant to sound smart 
but often fall flat. ""Democracy and the free market, the best 
institutions the West had to offer, stormed over the borders and ran 
deep into Russia,"" he tells us. ""But like all foreign armies throughout 
history, they quickly were spread too thin and became diluted."" And then 
there's this summation of his time in Russia: ""Those four years have 
left me with a lifetime of rabid ambivalence to chew on until I've got 
no teeth left.""Blakely manages to include a few unpleasant -- and wholly unnecessary -- 
laughs at the expense of Chinese workers and gays. And although I like 
wordplay as much as the next guy, it's jarring when non-English-speaking 
characters make puns in English. ""In a pinch,"" says one character, a 
chocolate factory director who warns Blakely not to store extra cocoa 
beans on site, ""I'm afraid we would probably take a pinch.""Some of these faults wouldn't matter if Siberia Bound were a picaresque 
novel or an account that didn't aspire to authenticity. But the effect 
here is to undermine a reader's faith in the narrator's reliability and 
to reduce most of the characters to the stock figures encountered in 
dozens of other accounts of Russian life. So in the end, I believed the 
broad contours of Blakely's story but found it hard to take seriously 
many of the particulars. And his ultimate conclusion -- that capitalism, 
material comfort and wealth do not bring happiness -- hardly qualifies 
as a revelation. â€¢David Tuller is a contributing writer at Salon.com and the author of

one quarter section spacing ( 160 acres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units ( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased well density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering pekisko oil we will down space as well . geological discussion pekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and associated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the pekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying this ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous / jurassic impermeable shales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and account for billions of barrels of reserves . production facilities discussion this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas over the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been constructed . a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed drilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is approximately 70 mmcf / d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf / d . accordingly , excess capacity of 24 mmcf / d exists in the facility which would be in the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible . this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of red deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get oil product to the transportation system . for more detailed project description please see news release dated ( fri , apr 29 ) . good luck and successfu | trading . conclusion : the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are already familiar with this . is mogi poised and positioned to do that for you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch this one trade tuesday ! go mogi . penny stocks are considered highly speculative and may be unsuitable for all but very aggressive investors . this profile is not in any way affiliated with the featured company . we were compensated 3000 dollars to distribute this report . this report is for entertainment and advertising purposes only and should not be used as investment advice .",Phishing Email

"Mike,i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart. my opinion is only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instant show') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing). i am mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting.my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways once there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they see amongst each other. that doesn't mean that people will stop talking on their phones, or that people will spend more time w/images than voice. just that it is fundamental. from news to crime to privacy to dating to family life to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosion of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of photography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changes things 'big time'.rgds, rob -----Original Message----- From: Mike Masnick [mailto:mike@techdirt.com] Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2002 11:58 PM To: Rob Shavell Cc: fork@spamassassin.taint.org Subject: RE: sprint delivers the next big thing??

I *do* care about content. Hell, if I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day, I'd have a different opinion of this. I just am not convinced that they will (stupid or not).While a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who communicate by pictures? Sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something?I don't buy it.For most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism. For some messages, pictures do the job, but I would say not nearly as often as words. Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and such are games? Because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across.>misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same >thing about '1 hour photo' processing. trivial, who needs it, i get better >resultion elswhere. and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the plant >had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital camera, >and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of >decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the >photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way. also, SMS >didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less. its >greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS >traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth. in reality, >SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.Again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with ""you just don't understand kids today, and they'll run with this""). I wasn't saying that MMS wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't easy. I was saying that I couldn't see why people would use it in a way that ""changed the face of communications"".I'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why people would want to do this. Sure, if they integrate cameras into the phone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people. But, mostly, I don't see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or offline) photoalbum.I don't think 1 hour photos are trivial. People want to see their own pics right away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots. That's one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on. The instant view part. I'm guessing your argument is that people not only want ""instant view"", but also ""instant show"". Which is what this service offers. I'm not convinced that most people want ""instant show"". I think people like to package their pictures and show them. That's why people put together fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture. Sure, occasionally ""instant show"" is nice, but it's just ""nice"" on occasion. I still can't see how it becomes a integral messaging method.What's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another? There has to be *some* benefit, even if it's silly if people are going to flock to it.I'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.The *only* really intriguing idea I've heard about things like MMS lately are Dan Gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of what happened - before the press even gets there.Willing to be proven wrong, MikePS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",Safe Email

"summary : whatever happened to 'd ? a few weeks ago i posted a query to the list regarding the disappearance of had or its contracted form ' d , in such expressions as she better stop , which appeared in a recent academic publication . i questioned people 's attitudes towards the standardisation of this new form ( better ) , the subsequent status of the bare infinitive ( stop ) , the possibility of its association with the extraposed construction it is better that she stop , ( implying a subjunctive analysis of stop ) and the likelihood of substituting another adjective ( e . g . good ) in place of better has a result of this . i also questioned the possibility of inverting better with the subject in interrogatives , given the analysis of it as an auxiliary form . i received 26 replies , and i would like to thank the following people who sent their comments , and anyone who is yet to do so : tamara al - kasey ; eleanor olds batchelder ; jonathon berg ; claudia brugman ; marsha bundman ; ellen contini - morava ; max copperman ; john cowan ( logical language group ) david fertig ; frederik fouvry ; dorine houston ; marge jackman ; roger lass ; deborah d . kela ruuskanen ; james kirchner ; timothy miller ; catherine rudin ; raphael salkie ; alena sanusi ; hal schiffman ; jane simpson ; dan slobin ; frits stuurman ; larry trask ; ivan uemlianen ; max wheeler . of 18 replies to the question of standardisation , 9 replied that it was not to be considered standard , 9 thought that it was either normal , informal or ok , and 8 did not consider this question . nobody liked the analysis of stop as a subjunctive , 2 people considering that the extraposed derivation sounded educated or stilted . one reply considered that stop was an imperative form . four people replied that better was an auxiliary , 7 thought it was a modal or semi-modal , and 2 thought that the construction was simply idiomatic . john cowan made mention of the use of better in yiddish - influenced american english as a sentence prefix : ' better she should n't go ' . with regard to its inversion in interrogatives , 9 people considered sai was not ok , one person thought it ok to invert in tags , and only one person thought main clause sai sounded ok . i also want to thank frederik fouvry for his reference : "" information based syntax and semantics "" ( hpsg vol . 1 , pollard & sag , 1987 ) in which better is analysed as an auxiliary that does n't allow inversion ; and frits stuurman for his references and comments : in g . gazdar , g . pullum , & i . sag ( 1982 ) "" auxiliaries and related phenomena in a restricted theory of phrase structure "" _ language _ 59 , 3 : 591-638 , pp . 610-611 , there is a reference to aren ' t as a similar case ( aren ' t i vs . i aren ' t ) ; and in gazdar , e . klein , pullum & sag ( 1985 ) _ generalized phrase structure grammar _ ( cambridge , mass . : harvard up ) , p . 64 , and gazdar , pullum & sag ( 1982 ) , p . 611 , footnote 17 , there are references to different meanings of modals like shall and might when inverted for interrogatives . frits stuurman also cites a gpsg reference to the use of better in p . sells ( 1985 ) _ lectures on government - binding theory , generalized phrase structure grammar , and lexical - functional grammar _ ( stanford : csli ) , p . 93 . many people found analogies with other modals that do not invert , e . g . claudia brugman mentions the difficulty of inverting ' she has to stop ' ) * ' has she to stop ? ' and gotta is equally impossible to invert . james kirchner also mentions otta as a similar case . tamara al - kasey compares the negative and the affirmative interrogatives : * ' had she better stop ? ' and ' had n't she better stop ? ' suggesting that the latter is more acceptable . other interesting items were : the vp - deletion version , observed by max wheeler ' we better had ' ; and at least 2 people considered that had seems to return only for inversion for interrogatives . generally , the use of inversion of better + subject was considered more common in tags , especially amongst children or teenagers , and jane simpson thinks that the tag bettern ' t you is now appearing in australian english , with or without the preceding ' d . ivan uemlianen ( british speaker from northern england ) claims he had always used the tag ' bettern ' t i ? ' as a child , which had always struck him as not quite right , and had never heard of the had until he heard it being used in old films . dan slobin considers the use of had to be archaic , or from another variety or era , although the inversion ' better she go ? ' does not appear in the speech of american - english preschoolers in their data . one respondent did n't know where the had came from , and another reanalysed it as would , in the same way as it has been reanalysed in conditional protases . another suggestion was that it was analogous to a pluperfect auxiliary without tense . two replied that the expression she better stop was just an example of sloppy editing . there was little discussion of phonological processes , but , in particular , i found interesting the following comments by roger lass : "" in my dialect anyhow ( new york city middle class ) , it 's certainly normal to say ( and sometimes , in less formal registers , to write ) , i better , you better , he better , we better , they better . . . observe though : all the pronouns end with a vowel , and there are alternative forms , e . g . i 'd better . . . though these are much less common . there is however another type , which is sometimes taken to be better but is n't : you [ b ] better , where there 's a sort of geminate or at least half-long consonant . the very fact that none of the syntactic things you mark with * or ? seem to occur would be an indication that there has not really been any kind of reanalysis , but rather an institutionalization of a fast-speech deletion and / or assimilation , which is creeping up into slower styles ( as often happens ) . in fact the construction itself is weird anyhow , since you had comparative does n't seem to exist , except in archaisms like ' i 'd liefer do that ' ( i can't use it , but i ' ve heard it ) . note also , it 's just occurred to me , that you do n't get deletion of - 'd in * i rather do that . . .

Did you actually attempt to order the DSL? Large chunks of somerville have
advertised DSL service that can't actually be obtained. Excuses vary, from
""no available copper"" to ""full DSLAM"", but the folks I know who've wanted
DSL around here have all failed, ending up either with ATTBB, RCN or an

> about  52 a year.  52 a year doesn't equal 3000.   Or even 300.Er, that study would seem to lend credence to Eugen's
estimations, rather than casting fresh doubts. 52 a year *does* exceed 300, in under 6 years' time. The average
age of that study's participants was *39* -- meaning some 
participants may have had 20-25+ years of active sex life. At that age, and further ** HIV+ **, it seems reasonable to
think that some the participants may have actually slowed 
their pace a bit. So while this study's summary info is incomplete, you could 
easily conclude that the *average* participant in this one study
will have had over a thousand partners over a 40-50+ year active 
sex life, and so the even-more-active tails of the distribution
could easily be in the 3000+ range.Of course this says very little, almost nothing, about the overall 
population behavior, gay or straight, and the relative prevalence
of 3K+ individuals in either group. But it does strongly suggest 
that gay males with 3K+ partners exist in measurable numbers, so
people should stop treating Eugen's anecdotal estimation as if it
were sheer fantasy. BitBitch's own citation suggests otherwise.- Gordon",Safe Email

today!You're a good bunch, you Penguins.Today's GnomeVOICE really tells the story better than I can, but I'll give you a quick summary. Through your efforts and compassion, reader Karl Steenblik has 
found a new electronic home for the Foundation for Children and Youth With 
Diabetes. I'll let Karl tell you which offered solution suited his needs. But, 
with the volume of responses his request for help generated, it's almost 
irrelevant. As I expected, we came together as a community and collectively 
offered him many viable choices from which to pick a solution that would work 
for the kids. The global scope of your concern and our collective ability to 
effect a change has humbled me once again. Just when you start to get a little 
callous about the 'Net ...Accordingly, I'd like to sketch out an idea with you that can be an ongoing part of Penguin Shell. It's an open discussion, really, about how we can further put 
our technical skills (be they Linux or Windows skills) to work for a good cause. I'm proposing that we start an organized volunteer effort, based in the 
Penguin Shell readership, to provide volunteer technical services to worthwhile 
charitable organizations. First, we need a name that clearly describes our purpose. Next, we need 
volunteers with the time and ability to lend those skills to a good cause. Finally, we'll need some suggestions as to 
the charitable organizations that are near and dear to your heart. Or, maybe the organization is one you're already working with - one you're certain 
can use some hands-on or remote volunteer help.I'll start that ball rolling with a personal organizational suggestions - the Aicardi Syndrome Foundation. 
Though I don't currently know their technical needs, I do know that the syndrome is very rare - read ""research and technical dollars are minimal."" I'm sure we 
can, as a group, provide them a way to fill existing technical holes.That's just a suggestion. Feel free to use the mailto links above to make 
others.Over the next few weeks, I plan on modifying my current favorite blogging 
program, GeekLog 
to pull together a community project area where interested parties can gather, 
coordinate and discuss whatever this project might become. I'll keep you posted 
on the details.In one of the earliest issues of Penguin Shell, I told a story about Emperor 
Penguins - how they huddle together on the shore, knowing that their protection 
from predators lies in sheer numbers. When one takes the leap into the water, 
all the others follow; individual involvement for the good of the community.Where could the analogy possibly be more fitting?

your set TODAY, ONLY $29.95!Quick ShortcutsLinux is chock full of keyboard shortcuts that, when used, streamline the way 
you use your system. Today's Tweaks are really user tweaks - built in shortcuts 
you can use to maximize your Linux efficiency. You don't have to change your 
system, just how you use what's already there. They're two tips that are quick 
and very easy to learn and remember.Got a cluttered console screen? Use [ctrl]+l to clear it. This does the 
same thing as the clear command with far fewer keystrokes.Do you want to log out of the console screen quickly? Use the [ctrl+d key combination. This will log out the current user. If you're using bash and the 
current user is not root, the [ctrl]+d combination will close the terminal 
window, as well.To me, any opportunity to save keystrokes is a good one. Better yet, if I can 
avoid having to take my fingers from the keyboard to reach for the mouse, then 
I've really saved some time. Though it's tough to quantify the time savings 
using these keystroke combination shortcuts, intuitively I can tell you it's 
substantial.Maximum efficiency. That's what Tweaks are all about.

Kernel Configuration - Part XIWe've covered some fairly light topics to this point in the kernel configuration series. Today's topic requires a bit of review. We'll discuss configuring block 
devices in your kernel.We've talked about the different types of devices in previous Penguin Shell 
issues. Fundamentally, the two that you'll deal with the most are block and 
character devices. These draw their type names from the way they handle data. 
Block devices receive data for storage in chunks, generally pre-set sizes of 
data ""blocks."" Hard drives are block devices. They'll only write chunks of data 
to storage. Thus, the problem with shutting down your machine uncleanly. Data 
intended for storage may not, in fact, have been written at the time your power 
dies or you hard kill your machine. The system may still be accumulating data up to the proper block size before committing it to the hard drive.Character devices, on the other hand, receive data in ""streams,"" one character 
at a time. Serial ports are a great example of character devices. They handle 
data input and output on the fly, rather than filling a buffer then 
committing the data.The physical nature of these device types goes a long way toward explaining why 
they handle data as they do. A hard drive has to physically spin up to store or 
retrieve data. You're actually changing the magnetic properties of the disc 
surface when you store data. Consequently, a hard drive has to know where 
there's free space on the disc surface, has to move that area of the disc under 
the write head and try, as best it can, to group blocks of related data 
together.Character devices really don't store data as much as they send it off and forget about it. The process is purely electrical rather than electrical and physical. 
The serial port, for example, sends data in a stream to your Palm Pilot. The 
storage of the data is actually handled by the Palm itself, not a physical 
storage device on the computer. There's no need to spin up a drive and account 
for the data as is necessary with a hard drive. The Palm will also send a signal back to the computer confirming receipt of data. That's an indication that 
character devices often communicate in both directions, as well.So, when you're configuring block devices in your kernel, you're preparing the 
system for communicating with a device that will buffer data to a predetermined 
level, then write that data as a block, changing the physical properties of the 
hard drive disc surface. Even though that's the highest level view of the 
process, it still shows how difficult a process physical data storage really 
is.In the block device section, you'll find many options for physical data storage. When configuring this section, it's crucial to know as much about your existing 
hardware as possible. What type (brand) of hard drives are you using? What's the interface to the machine - IDE, parallel, etc? Where is the drive located - on 
the local machine or on a network-connected box? Because the variables are so 
broad, it's nearly impossible to give you a stock configuration tip that will 
work for your personal machine every time. I can tell you this - you will have 
block devices (normally a hard drive and a floppy), and you need to answer as 
many of the above questions as you can. Find out as much about these physical 
devices as you can, and the configuration process will be relatively 
painless.A warning - you'll see more configuration tips like this as the series continues to progress. I'll certainly make hands-on configuration recommendations where 
possible. There are quite a few areas where I can make such recommendations. 
However, where the variable set is as broad as block devices, much of the 
legwork will be up to you.Tomorrow, we'll talk about RAID and multi-device support in Linux.Recommend It!

rxLinuxhttp://www.fusionw3.com/rxlinux/ ""The concept behind rxlinux is to centralise configuration and management of 
multiple Linux servers. New servers can be deployed in minutes. A Web interface 
is used to build custom ISO CD-ROMs dedicated for specific servers. Servers, 
also called rxnodes, boot up from that CD-ROM and get the rest of the 
configuration and software from a master server. No administration is done 
directly on the nodes; everything is controlled from the master servers. When 
the rxnode has finished booting up and all software is running, it is completely independent from the rxmaster until the next reboot.""

Is it possible to get some sort of low- end internal tape / other solution that could be used to back up approx. 40 Gigs of data or am I just dreaming? My ISP does offer backups at extra cost but the only problem with that is, well, the extra cost.What I was hoping to do was to install some kind of internal tape device, then swap tapes round every month, so I had an onsite backup of say the last 24 hours and an offsite backup of the last month. Is this feasible? I'm beginning to think it isn't. External devices are not an option as part of the charge for colocation is rackspace.Thanks, Ciaran.-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

Date: 2002-10-03T14:52:57-05:00So, d'ya remember that whole CSS debate that flared up about six months ago? 
(Actually, it flares up continuously in various circles. In fact, I think it's 
about time for it to flare up again in weblogging circles. These things are 
inexorably cyclical. CSS-vs-tables is the hemorrhoid of the web design world. 
But I digress.) If you were around back then, you will no doubt recall that I was in the 
pro-CSS camp[1]. So anyway, d'ya remember that argument that went something like â€œyou 
should design with web standards and CSS because it will future-proof your site 
for the pie-in-the-sky future when people surf the web on mobile 
devicesâ€? Well, it's crap[2]. There are lots of good arguments for designing with web standards and CSS: 
automatically print-friendly pages[3], dynamic style switchers[4], reduced 
bandwidth[5], and aiding and abetting accessibility[6] (a topic which I claim 
to know a lot about[7]), among others. But â€œbecause it'll future-proof 
your site for the next generation of mobile devicesâ€ is not one of them. 
The theory is solid, but apparently nobody told the makers of the mobile 
devices (now that we have them) how it was all supposed to work in practice.

"t thanks to everyone who responded to my questions about latex fonts and using linux in general . respondents were : jen hay ( jennifer . hay @ vuw . ac . nz ) mark hale ( hale1 @ husc . harvard . edu ) greg iverson ( iverson @ csd . uwm . edu ) "" james a . mcgilvray "" ( jim @ dep . philo . mcgill . ca ) michael covington ( mcovingt @ ai . uga . edu ) james magnuson ( magnuson @ hip . atr . co . jp ) uli sauerland ( sauerlan @ mit . edu ) tom green ( tmgreen @ mit . edu ) "" larry trask "" ( larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk ) ted . harding @ nessie . mcc . ac . uk ( ted harding ) "" c . a . creider "" ( creider @ julian . uwo . ca ) mark liberman ( myl @ sansom . ling . upenn . edu ) first of all , the responses clearly indicate that there exists at least two ipa fonts for latex ( see below ) . responses to my more general questions ranged from enthusiastic encouragement about using latex and linux , to fervernt wishes that i rethink my abandonment of the macintosh os , to recommendations of other operating systems and / or text-processing or dsp systems . i should perhaps have mentioned that i am already relatively familiar with bsd unix , so switching to linux will not be much of a shock in and of itself - though obviously using latex will be quite a change from a mac - based word processor . . . the score is currently : pro latex w / ipa : 7 pro linux : 4 pro mac : 1 pro nextstep : 1 anti latex : 1 and a number of somewhat mixed responses , suggesting for the most part that i remain with a mac for text processing , but work with some kind of unix environment for dsp and data processing , or that i stick with a mac for the actual sound manipulation but switch to linux for everything else . re : dsp there were at least two recommendations for signalyze for the macintosh , and two for ogi-tools for unix systems . some select quotes ( anonymously to discourage os partisanship from seeping into real life ) : "" i thoroughly recommend switching to latex . "" "" i ' m running a linux box and use latex for all professional word - processing these days . . . i have n't found anything i can't do yet . "" "" i ' ll say this for linux , compared to dos , windows , os / 2 , desqview , and windows nt ( latest versions of all ) , i ' ve been running linux for a year and a half and it has never once crashed . never . every one of those others has . "" "" gee , i hope switching from a macintosh to a linux workstation is n't too painful . . . do you really have to do this ( power macintosh machines are indeed powerful , and the word processing situation is well developed with wordperfect 3 . 1 , nisus writer 4 . 06 , others ) . "" "" while on the topic of unix instantiations of tex , you might look at nextstep instead of linux . . . next 's gui is , honestly , elegant . "" "" there are several good ipa font sets for latex , as well as a whole bunch of accents available even if you do n't use special fonts . "" "" i use latex ( both on linux and on other unixes ) for all my papers and there are a couple good packages of phonetic symbol fonts that work great with latex . "" "" first of all , i dislike latex intensely , as do most of my colleagues in linguistics . we find it uniquely user-hostile : basically , you can't change any defaults unless you have a degree in hacking . . . on the whole , then , my advice is to stay away from latex . "" "" i am a linux user , and can assure you that latex and all sorts of extensions work very well with linux . so if you can find the linguistic tools for latex you should be able to use them with linux . "" i have also had a few requests that i share the information regarding where to find latex ipa fonts : there are apparently at least two , maybe more . one is called tsipa and is from japan . another is called wsuipa , and is from washington state university . one other person mentioned a font set from waterloo , but did not give more details . tsipa is available at ftp . shsu . edu in tex-archive / fonts / tsipa a couple people mentioned the tex - for-linguists newsgroup , at listserv @ shsu . edu , but this may no longer be running . there is also a tex newsgroup , comp . text . tex for more info . thanks again to all the people who responded so quickly . i am going to give the linux / latex system a shot , and see what i can make of it . - alex afrancis @ midway . uchicago . edu alex francis ( 312 ) - 667-5432 department of linguistics afrancis @ midway . uchicago . edu university of chicago ( 312 ) 667-5432 ( home ) 1010 e . 59th st .

"sum : x - rays and acoustic signals dear linguist members , some weeks ago i published a request for information about methods of measuring movements of the articulating organs . within this field i was especially interested in x - ray documentation and films . alice faber ( faber @ haskins . yale . edu ) wrote that "" back in the 1960 's the center for applied linguistics here in the us made a set of such films of ' exotic ' languages . we have a set here at haskins , . . . "" caroline smith reported on another method of measurement . she wrote that a method of measurement which works on the basis of electromagnetism was used by "" the people at the institut fuer phonetik und sprachliche kommunikation der universitaet muenchen , who are the world leaders in electromagneticarticulography ( fipkm @ phonetik . uni-muenchen . de ) . "" bob port ( port @ cs . indiana . edu ) from indiana reports on "" x - ray microbeam data at univ of wisconsin . "" and continues "" there is now a large amount of material available , but is not in video form "" a most interesting hint at x - ray documentation i want to give verbally at this place : kenneth r . beesley ( ken . beesley @ xerox . fr ) writes : "" i have also seen x - ray movies from the eastman collection in rochester , new york . these films show , among many other things , people talking , playing musical instruments , and moving in various ways . for medical interest , there are also films of swallowing and bladder functions . i have seen some x - ray photographs of vowel-production settings from the old ussr , but these are less interesting than films . the eastman films , produced in the 1940s and early 50s , i believe , are unintentionally frightening because the doses of x - rays considered safe then were perhaps 500 times what they are now . as best i can remember , these films were somewhat inspired by x - ray films made by the nazis using inmates of concentration camps . these films , brought back to the united states after the war , were watched in fascination by eastman and his colleagues . they featured scenes with full skeletons walking about . the x - ray doses were no doubt fatal to the victims . "" beesley also reports on phoneticians from the university of glasgow , scotland and members of the school of dentistry , who some eighteen years ago produced x - ray images that show people talking . helmer strike ( strik @ let . kun . nl ) delivers two methods of measuring articulation : "" the technique that resembles the old x - ray films the most is called mri ( magnetic resonance imaging ) . a good article on this topic is baer et al . ( 1991 ) journal of the acoustical society of america , nr . 90 ( 2 ) , pp . 799 - 828 . . . . another , quite different technique , which is used very often , is called epg ( electro - palato - graphy ) "" in particular , i would like to thank ocke bohn ( gen01 . @ rz . uni-kiel . d400 . de ) for having sent me an article on how to describe articulation by means of infrared light . she reported as well on experiments using ultrasound for recording the movements of the articulating organs . in conclusion , i want to give another idea of how to make use of cd-rom in combination with x - ray technology . today 's technology has made it possible to save pictures and videos ( here videos produced through x - rays ) conveniently down onto a cd . this opens up the possibility to combine recordings of various institutions on one cd and , by means of this collection , deliver an outstanding contribution to the further understanding of what is happening when people talk . besides the actual recordings , further information about videos and x - ray images that concerns both the history of this subject and its methodology could be gathered in one single multi media application in such a way that a cd like this would provide important information about the topic "" articulation and the methods of its measurement "" in a user-friendly way and , what is more , would be available for a greater number of non-expert pc - users . anyone interested in this project and willing to support this idea should write to one of the following addresses : e - mail : fran2801 @ pcmail . uni-trier . de home : ingolf franke zeughausstrasse 31 d-54292 trier germany",Safe Email

"--------------------------------------------------------------------------What is MIME?MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"".  It is the
standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the
world-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sending
images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text
files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part
of the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a
recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. How can I read a MIME message?Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use
which do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing
number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular
MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the
University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host
ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation
capability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do
not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is
still hope! There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME
message.  One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"".  It was developed
at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the
host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions
available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with
older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also
decode messages in split-uuencoded format. Does MIME replace UUENCODE?Yes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so
that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical
limitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust
encoding called ""Base64"" which has been carefully designed to survive the
message transformations made by certain email gateways. How can I learn more about MIME?The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via
anonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including:

"latest draft don , attached is my latest effort . it entailed fairly drastic "" restructuring and reorganization "" of the earlier draft . my revision effort has been directed at improving the focus of the paper . the new story is the following : 1 . enron was formed as a regulated gas pipeline company in the mid - eighties . 2 . economic and competitive conditions conspired to force a dramatic reorganization of the company almost immediately . the result was the creation of a new , unregulated energy trading operation . the strategy of the new unit was to capitalize on business opportunities in the deregulation of markets that was occuring at the time ( mid - eighties until now ) . 3 . the business model adopted for the new unregulated business was that of a "" gas bank "" . the analogy to a commercial bank posed a very difficult problem to enron ' s management in that there was no source of liquidity to the market from a central bank authority . as a consequence enron had to develop its own very elaborate risk management procedures . 4 . another consequence of the new business model was that it required a different set of employee skills and talents . specifically , it required were bright , energetic and innovative individuals capable of identifying entrepreneurial opportunities and starting new businesses . furthermore , a new , flatter organizational structure entailing decentralized decision making was required to facilitate quick response to changing market conditions . to monitor and manage this new "" empowered "" labor force required that the firm develop new personnel policies and procedures . 5 . three primary tools of personnel management were adopted : ( i ) measure performance semi - annually , ( ii ) tie compensation closely to performance , and ( iii ) allow personnel free movement within enron to seek out the best opportunities . 6 . other attributes of the enron model include consideration for asset optionality , recognition of the value of networks in adding value to trading platforms , and the use of mark - to - market accounting for business transactions as a means of ensuring transparency and promoting prompt actions . if my "" story line "" sounds better than the draft i have attached its because its the last thing i ' ve written . at any rate i look forward to hearing your comments and to getting this wrapped up . thanks and i look forward to seeing you in february . john - enron _ paper _ 1 _ 26 _ 01 . doc john d . martin carr p . collins chair in finance finance department baylor university po box 98004 waco , tx 76798 254 - 710 - 4473 ( office ) 254 - 710 - 1092 ( fax ) j _ martin @ baylor . edu web : http : / / hsb . baylor . edu / html / martinj / home . html",Safe Email

""60 Minutes II"" Bush Interview:(CBS)Â No president since Abraham Lincoln has seen such horrific loss of 
life in a war on American soil. No president since James Madison, nearly 
200 years ago, has seen the nationâ€™s capital city successfully attacked. 
But, one year ago, President George W. Bush was thrown into the first 
great crisis of the 21st century.This is the presidentâ€™s story of September 11th and the week America 
went to war. 60 Minutes II spent two hours with Mr. Bush, one, on Air 
Force One and another in the Oval Office last week. Even after a year, 
the president is still moved, sometimes to the point of tears, when he 
remembers Sept. 11.â€œI knew, the farther we get away from Sept.11, the more likely it is for 
some around the world to forget the mission, but not me,â€ Mr. Bush says 
during the Air Force One interview. â€œNot me. I made the pledge to myself 
and to people that Iâ€™m not going to forget what happened on Sept. 11. So 
long as Iâ€™m president, we will pursue the killers and bring them to 
justice. We owe that to those who have lost their lives.â€The memories come back sharp and clear on Air Force One, where Pelley 
joined the president for a recent trip across country. 60 Minutes II 
wanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first 
hours after the attack.Not since Lyndon Johnson was sworn in on Air Force One has the airplane 
been so central to America in a crisis.For President Bush, Sept. 11 2001, started with the usual routine. 
Before dawn, the president was on his four-mile run. It was just before 
6 a.m. and, at the same moment, another man was on the move: Mohammad 
Atta. Two hours later, as Mr. Bush drove to an elementary school, 
hijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the 
airliners east. As the motorcade neared the school at 8:45 a.m., jet 
engines echoed in Manhattan.Atta plunged the 767 jumbo jet into World Trade Center Tower One.â€œI thought it was an accident,â€ says Mr. Bush. â€œI thought it was a pilot 
error. I thought that some foolish soul had gotten lost and - and made a 
terrible mistake.â€Mr. Bush was told about the first plane just before sitting down with a 
class of second graders. He was watching a reading drill when, just 
after nine, United Flight 175 exploded into the second tower. There was 
the sudden realization that what had seemed like a terrible mistake was 
a coordinated attack.Back in the Florida classroom, press secretary Ari Fleischer got the 
news on his pager. The presidentâ€™s chief-of-staff, Andy Card stepped in.â€œA second plane hit the second tower; America is under attack,â€ Card 
told the presidentWhen he said those words, what did he see in the Presidentâ€™s face?â€œI saw him coming to recognition of what I had said,â€ Card recalls. â€œI 
think he understood that he was going to have to take command as 
commander-in-chief, not just as president.â€What was going through Bushâ€™s mind when he heard the news?â€œWeâ€™re at war and somebody has dared attack us and weâ€™re going to do 
something about it,â€ Mr. Bush recalls. â€œI realized I was in a unique 
setting to receive a message that somebody attacked us, and I was 
looking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war. I 
can remember noticing the press pool and the press corps beginning to 
get the calls and seeing the look on their face. And it became evident 
that we were, you know, that the world had changed.â€Mr. Bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone. He called 
the vice president, pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the 
attack on TV. Then he grabbed a legal pad and quickly wrote his first 
words to the nation.""Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America,â€ he said 
in the speech. â€œToday, weâ€™ve had a national tragedy.â€It was 9:30 a.m. As he spoke, Mr. Bush didnâ€™t know that two more 
hijacked jets were streaking toward Washington. Vice Pesident Dick 
Cheney was in his office at the White House when a Secret Service agent 
ran in.â€œHe said to me, â€˜Sir, we have to leave immediatelyâ€™ and grabbed, put a 
hand on my belt, another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the 
door of my office,â€ Cheney recalls. â€œIâ€™m not sure how they do it, but 
they sort of levitate you down the hallway, you move very fast.â€â€œThere wasnâ€™t a lot of time for chitchat, you know, with the vice 
president,â€ says Secret Service Director Brian Stafford, who was in his 
command center ordering the round-up of top officials and the First 
Family. He felt that he had only minutes to work with. â€œWe knew there 
were unidentified planes tracking in our direction,â€ he says.Cheney was rushed deep under the White House into a bunker called the 
Presidential Emergency Operations Center. It was built for war, and this 
was it. On her way down, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice 
called Mr. Bush.â€œIt was brief because I was being pushed to get off the phone and get 
out of the West Wing,â€ says Rice. â€œThey were hurrying me off the phone 
with the president and I just said, he said, â€˜Iâ€™m coming backâ€™ and we 
said â€˜Mr. President that may not be wise.â€™ I remember stopping briefly 
to call my family, my aunt and uncle in Alabama and say, â€˜Iâ€™m fine. You 
have to tell everybody that Iâ€™m fineâ€™ but then settling into trying to 
deal with the enormity of that moment, and in the first few hours, I 
think the thing that was on everybodyâ€™s mind was how many more planes 
are coming.â€The Capitol was evacuated. And for the first time ever, the Secret 
Service executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of 
succession. Agents swept up the 15 officials who stood to become 
president if the others were killed. They wanted to move Vice President 
Cheney, fearing he was in danger even in the bunker. But Cheney says 
when he heard the other officials were safe, he decided to stay at the 
White House, no matter what.â€œItâ€™s important to emphasize it's not personal, you donâ€™t think of it in 
personal terms, youâ€™ve got a professional job to do,â€ says Cheney.Cheney was joined by transportation secretary Norm Mineta who remembers 
hearing the FAA counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the 
capital.Says Mineta: â€œSomeone came in and said â€˜Mr. Vice president thereâ€™s a 
plane 50 miles out,â€™ then he came in and said â€˜Its now 10 miles out, we 
donâ€™t know where it is exactly, but itâ€™s coming in low and fast.â€™â€It was American Flight 77. At 9:38 a.m., it exploded into the Pentagon, 
the first successful attack on Washington since the War of 1812.As the Pentagon burned, Mr. Bushâ€™s limousine sped toward Air Force One 
in Florida. At that moment, United Flight 93 - the last hijacked plane - 
was taking dead aim at Washington. At the White House, the staff was in 
the West Wing cafeteria, watching on TV. Press Secretary Jennifer 
Millerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate.â€œI no sooner walked outside when someone from the Secret Service yelled 
â€˜Women drop your heels and run, drop your heels and run,â€™ and suddenly 
the gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and 
the whole White House just flooded out,â€ she recalls.In Florida, as Mr. Bush boarded Air Force One, he was overheard telling 
a Secret Service agent â€œBe sure to get the First Lady and my daughters 
protected.â€ At 9:57 a.m., Air Force One thundered down the runway, 
blasting smoke and dust in a full -hrust take off. Communications 
Director Dan Bartlett was on board.â€œIt was like a rocket,â€ he remembers. â€œFor a good ten minutes, the plane 
was going almost straight up.â€At the same moment, 56 minutes after it was hit, World Trade Center 
Tower Two began to falter, then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche 
of steel, concrete and human lives.â€œSomeone said to me, â€˜Look at thatâ€™ I remember that, â€˜Look at thatâ€™ and 
I looked up and I saw and I just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and 
the horror of that moment,â€ recalls Rice of the TV newscast.She also felt something in her gut: â€œThat weâ€™ve lost a lot of Americans 
and that eventually we would get these people. I felt the anger. Of 
course I felt the anger.â€Down in the bunker, Cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked 
planes there were. Officials feared there could be as many as 11.As the planes track toward Washington, a discussion begins about whether 
to shoot them down. â€œI discussed it with the president,â€ Cheney 
recalls. â€œâ€˜Are we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these 
airliners that have been hijacked?â€™ He said yes.â€â€œIt was my advice. It was his decision,â€ says Cheney.â€œThatâ€™s a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot 
down your own civilian aircraft,â€ says Bush. â€œBut it was an easy 
decision to make given the â€“ given the fact that we had learned that a 
commercial aircraft was being used as a weapon. I say easy decision, it 
was, I didnâ€™t hesitate, let me put it that way. I knew what had to be 
done.â€The passengers on United Flight 93 also knew what had to be done. They 
fought for control and sacrificed themselves in a Pennsylvania meadow. 
The flight was 15 minutes from Washington.â€œClearly, the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of 
government as they could: the Pentagon, perhaps the Capitol, perhaps the 
White House. These people saved us not only physically but they saved us 
psychologically and symbolically in a very important way, too,â€ says 
Rice.Meanwhile, Tower One was weakening. It had stood for an hour and 43 
minutes. At 10:29 a.m., it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of 
its twin.The image that went round the world reached the First Lady in a secure 
location somewhere in Washington. â€œI was horrified,â€ she says. â€œI 
thought, â€˜Dear God, protect as many citizens as you can.â€™ It was a 
nightmare.â€By 10:30 a.m., Americaâ€™s largest city was devastated, its military 
headquarters were burning. Air force One turned west along the Gulf 
Coast.â€œI can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the 
consequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining 
moment in the history of the United States,â€ says President Bush. â€œI 
didnâ€™t need any legal briefs, I didnâ€™t need any consultations, I knew we 
were at war.â€Mr. Bush says the first hours were frustrating. He watched the 
horrifying pictures, but the TV signal was breaking up. His calls to 
Cheney were cutting out. Mr. Bush says he pounded his desk shouting, 
â€œThis is inexcusable; get me the vice president.â€â€œI was trying to clear the fog of war, and there is a fog of war, says 
the president. ""Information was just flying from all directions.â€Chief of staff Card brought in the reports. There was word Camp David 
had been hit. A jet was thought to be targeting Mr. Bushâ€™s ranch.â€œI remember hearing that the State Department might have been hit, or 
that the White House had a fire in it. So we were hearing lots of 
different information,â€ says Card.They also feared that Air Force One itself was a target. Cheney told the 
president there was a credible threat against the plane. Using the code 
name for Air Force One, Mr. Bush told an aide, â€œAngel is next.â€ The 
threat was passed to presidential pilot Colonel Mark Tillman.â€œIt was serious before that but now it is -no longer is it a time to get 
the president home,â€ Tillman says. â€œWe actually have to consider 
everything we say, everything we do could be intercepted, and we have to 
make sure that no one knows what our position is.â€Tillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while Secret 
Service agents double-checked the identity of everyone on board. The 
crew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan. Then came a warning from 
air traffic control â€“ a suspect airliner was dead ahead.â€œComing out of Sarasota there was one call that said there was an 
airliner off our nose that they did not have contact with,â€ Tillman 
remembers.Tillman took evasive action, pulling his plane high above normal 
traffic. They were on course for Washington, but by now no one thought 
that was a good idea, except the president.â€œI wanted to come back to Washington, but the circumstances were such 
that it was just impossible for the Secret Service or the national 
security team to clear the way for Air Force One to come back,â€ says 
Bush.So Air Force One set course for an underground command center in 
Nebraska. Back in Washington, the presidentâ€™s closest advisor, Karen 
Hughes, heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to Mr. 
Bush.â€œAnd the military operator came back to me and in a voice that, to me, 
sounded very shaken said, â€˜Maâ€™am, Iâ€™m sorry, we canâ€™t reach Air Force 
One.â€™â€ Hughes recalls. Hughes was out of the White House during the 
attacks. When she came back, it was a place she didnâ€™t recognize.â€œThere were either military, or maybe Secret Service, dressed all in 
black, holding machine guns as, as we drove up. And I never expected to 
see something like that in, in our nation's capital,â€ says Hughes.When she walked into the White House, no one was inside. â€œI knew it was 
a day that you didn't want to surprise anybody, and so I yelled, 
â€˜Hello?â€™ and two, again, kind of SWAT team members came running, running 
through the, the hall with, again, guns drawn, and then took me to, to 
the location where I met the vice president.â€On Air Force One, Col. Tillman had a problem. He needed to hide the most 
visible plane in the world, a 747 longer than the White House itself. He 
didnâ€™t want to use his radio, because the hijackers could be listening 
to air traffic control. So he called air traffic control on the 
telephone.â€œWe actually didn't tell them our destination or what directions we were 
heading,â€ says Tillman. â€œWe, we basically just talked to 'em and said, 
'OK, fine, we have no clearance at this time, we are just going to fly 
across the United States.'â€Controllers passed Air Force One from one sector to another, warning 
each other to keep the route secret.â€œOK, whereâ€™s he going?â€ one tower radioed to another.â€œJust watch him,â€ a second tower responded. â€œDonâ€™t question him whereâ€™s 
he's going. Just work him and watch him, thereâ€™s no flight plan in and 
weâ€™re not going to put anything in. Ok, sir?â€Air Force One ordered a fighter escort, and air traffic control radioed 
back: â€œAir Force One, got two F-16s at about your 10 oâ€™clock position.â€â€œThe staff, and the president and us, were filed out along the outside 
hallway of his presidential cabin there and looking out the windows,â€ 
says Bartlett. â€œAnd the president gives them a signal of salute, and the 
pilot kind of tips his wing, and fades off and backs into formation.â€The men in the F-16s were Shane Brotherton and Randy Roberts, from the 
Texas Air National Guard. Their mission was so secret their commander 
wouldnâ€™t tell them where they were going.â€œHe just said, 'Youâ€™ll know when you see it,' and that was my first 
clue, I didnâ€™t have any idea what we were going up until that point,â€ 
says Brotherton. He knew when he saw it.â€œWe, we were trying to keep an 80-mile bubble, bubble around Air Force 
One, and we'd investigate anything that was within 80 miles,â€ says 
Roberts.Bush says he was not worried about the safety of the people on this 
aircraft, or for his own safety: â€œI looked out the airplane and saw two 
F-16s on each wing. It was going to have to be a pretty good pilot to 
get us.â€We now know that the threat to Air Force One was part of the fog of war, 
a false alarm. But it had a powerful effect at the time. Some wondered, 
with the president out of sight, was he still running the government? He 
hadnâ€™t appeared after the attack on Washington. Mr. Bush was clearly 
worried about it. At one point he was overheard saying, â€œThe American 
people want to know where their dang president is.â€ The staff considered 
an address to the nation by phone but instead Mr. Bush ordered Air Force 
One to land somewhere within 30 minutes so he could appear on TV. At 
11:45 a.m., they landed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.â€œThe resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake, 
we will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless,â€ Bush 
said to the nation from Barksdale.At Barksdale, the Secret Service believed the situation in Washington 
was still unsafe. So the plane continued on to Nebraska, to the command 
center where Mr. Bush would be secure and have all the communications 
gear he needed to run the government. Aboard Air Force One, Mr. Bush had 
a job for press secretary Fleischer.â€œThe president asked me to make sure that I took down everything that 
was said. I think he wanted to make certain that a record existed,â€ says 
FleischerFleischerâ€™s notes capture Mr. Bushâ€™s language, plain and unguarded. To 
the vice president he said: â€œWeâ€™re at war, Dick, weâ€™re going to find out 
who did this and kick their ass.â€ Another time, Mr. Bush said, â€œWeâ€™re 
not going to have any slap-on-the-wrist crap this time.â€The President adds, â€œI can remember telling the Secretary of Defense, I 
said, â€˜Weâ€™re going to find out who did this and then Mr. Secretary, you 
and Dick Myers,â€™ who we just named as chairman of the joint chiefs, â€˜are 
going to go get them.â€™â€By 3 p.m., Air Force One touched down at Offutt Air Force Base in 
Nebraska. Mr. Bush and his team were herded into a small brick hut that 
gave no hint of what they would find below.At the bottom of the stairs was the U.S. Strategic Command Underground 
Command Center. It was built to transmit a presidentâ€™s order to go to 
nuclear war. But when Mr. Bush walked in, the battle staff was watching 
the skies over the United States. Many airplanes had still not landed. 
After a short briefing, Mr. Bush and Card were taken to a teleconference 
center which connected them to the White House, the Pentagon, the FBI 
and the CIA. Mr. Bush had a question for his CIA Director George Tenent.According to Rice, Bush asked Tenent who had done this. Rice recalls 
that Tenent answered: â€œSir, I believe its al Qaeda. Weâ€™re doing the 
assessment but it looks like, it feels like, it smells like al Qaeda.â€The evidence would build. FBI Director Robert Mueller says that an 
essential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed.A flight attendant on American Flight 11, Amy Sweeney, had the presence 
of mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the 
seat numbers of the hijackers. â€œThat was the first piece of hard 
evidence. We could then go to the manifest, find out who was sitting in 
those seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those 
individuals, as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and 
going through a process of elimination,â€ says Mueller.In Nebraska, the White House staff was preparing for an address to the 
nation from the Air Force bunker, but by then the president had had 
enough. He decided to come back.â€œAt one point, he said he didnâ€™t want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him 
out of Washington,â€ Fleischer says. â€œThat verbatim.â€On board, he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world: 
â€œI had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged. One was that 
you're guilty if you harbor a terrorist, because I knew these terrorists 
like al-Qaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people. The 
other thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition 
of countries that would either be with us or with the terrorists.â€As Air Force One sped east, the last casualty of the attack on America 
collapsed, one of the nationâ€™s worst days wore into evening. At the 
World Trade Center, 2,801 were killed; at the Pentagon, 184; and in 
Pennsylvania 40. Altogether, there were 3,025 dead.â€œAnybody who would attack America the way they did, anybody who would 
take innocent life the way they did, anybody who's so devious, is evil,â€ 
Bush said recently.Mr. Bush would soon see that evil face to face. After arriving in 
Washington, he boarded his helicopter and flew past the Pentagon on the 
way to the White House.Was there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a White 
House to return to? â€œI donâ€™t remember thinking about whether or not the 
White House would have been obliterated,"" he recalls. ""I think I might 
have thought they took their best shot, and now it was time for us to 
take our best shot.â€Mr. Bush arrived back at the White House nine hours after the attacks. 
His next step was an address to the nation. Karen Hughes and her staff 
were already working on the speech.â€œHe decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was 
reassurance,â€ remembers Hughes. â€œWe had to show resolve, we had to 
reassure people, we had to let them know that we would be OK.â€Just off the Oval Office, Mr. Bush added the words that would become 
known as the Bush Doctrine - no distinction between terrorists and those 
who harbor them. The staff wanted to add a declaration of war but Mr. 
Bush didnâ€™t think the American people wanted to hear it that night and 
he was emphatic about that.He prepared to say it from the same desk where Franklin Roosevelt first 
heard the news of Pearl Harbor. Now Bush was commander in chief. Eighty 
million Americans were watching.â€œToday our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under 
attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts,â€ he said 
from the Oval Office that night.The Oval Office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in American 
history since the Civil War. Before he walked to the White House 
residence for the night, Mr. Bush dictated these words for the White 
House daily log: â€œThe Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today. 
We think it's Osama bin Laden.â€(CBS)Â When Sept. 12 dawned, President Bush was demanding a war plan. No 
one in the White House or the Pentagon could be sure of what the 
president would do. In office for just eight months, heâ€™d never been 
tested as commander-in-chief.â€œI never asked them what they thought,â€ President Bush said of the 
Pentagon brass, â€œbecause I didnâ€™t really â€“ because I knew what I was 
gonna do. I knew exactly what had to be done, Scott. And that was to set 
a strategy to seek justice. Find out who did it, hunt them down and 
bring them to justice.â€In the cabinet room, the president made clear what was next: â€œThe 
deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against 
our country were more than acts of terror, they were acts of war,â€ he 
said.To the war cabinet, al Qaeda was no surprise. National Security Advisor 
Condoleezza Rice says the administration had been at work on a plan to 
strike bin Ladenâ€™s organization well before Sept. 11.â€œThe president said, â€˜You know Iâ€™m tired of swatting at flies, I need a 
strategy to eliminate these guys,â€™â€ Rice recalls.In one of the worst intelligence failures ever, the CIA and FBI didnâ€™t 
pick up clues that an attack in the United States was imminent. Without 
a sense of urgency, the White House strategy the president had asked for 
came too late.Chief of Staff Andrew Card recalls that the plan Mr. Bush had asked for 
was â€œliterally headed to the presidentâ€™s desk, I think, on the eleventh, 
tenth or eleventh, of September.â€On Sept. 12, the war cabinet was debating the full range of options - 
who to hit and how to hit them. There were some at the Pentagon who 
worried in the early hours that Mr. Bush would order up an immediate 
cruise missile strike, of the kind that had not deterred bin Laden in 
the past.â€œWell, thereâ€™s a lot of nervous Nellies at the Pentagon, anyway,â€ Mr. 
Bush tells Pelley. â€œA lot of people like to chatter, you know, more than 
they should. But no, I appreciate that very much. Secretary of Defense 
(Donald) Rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what 
we called â€˜boots on the ground.â€™ That if youâ€™re gonna go to war, then 
youâ€™ve gotta go to war with all your assets.â€The president says he wanted to â€œfight and win a guerilla war with 
conventional means.â€It was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by CIA Director 
George Tenent. Tenent wanted to combine American technology and 
intelligence with the brute force of Afghan fighters hostile to the 
Taliban government.Secretary of State Colin Powell, noting that the CIA had already 
developed a long relationship with the Afghan resistance, called it an 
unconventional solution to an unconventional problem.â€œAs I like to describe it to my friends,â€ Powell says, â€œwe had on the 
ground a Fourth World army riding horses and living in tents with some 
CIA and special forces with them and we had a First World air force, the 
best in the world. How do you connect it all?â€The president gave them 48 hours to figure it out.Meanwhile, Mr. Bush went to the battlefield himself. Just the day 
before, he had called the Pentagon the â€œmightiest building in the 
world.â€ Now one-fifth of it was in ruins. The wreckage of American 
Flight 77 was being examined by Navy investigators. And before Mr. Bush 
left, he made a point of speaking personally with the team recovering 
the remains of the first casualties of war on his watch.
The next day, Sept. 13, there was another warning of attack that the 
public never heard about. Threats had been were coming in constantly but 
this one sounded credible: a large truck bomb headed to the White House. 
The Secret Service wanted the president back in the bunker.â€œHe wasnâ€™t real receptive to that, to that recommendation,â€ remembers 
Brian Stafford, director of the Secret Service. â€œAnd he ordered a 
hamburger and said he was going to stay in the White House that evening 
and thatâ€™s what he did.â€The next day, would be one of the longest and the most difficult for the 
president. On Friday, Sept. 14, Mr. Bush started the day with a cabinet 
meeting, but he wept when he walked in and was surprised by applause.â€œHe sat down, slightly overcome, for a moment but he recaptured it,â€ 
says Powell who remembers being worried that the president might have 
trouble getting through his speech at the national memorial service 
later that morning.â€œAnd I just scribbled a little note to him,â€ Powell recalls, â€œand I 
said, â€˜Mr. President, Iâ€™ve learned over the years when you are going to 
give a very emotional speech, watch out for certain words that will 
cause you to start to tear up.â€™ He looked at me and he smiled and then 
at the next break in the conversation he said, â€˜The Secretary of State 
told me not to break down at the memorial service,â€™ and that broke the 
tension and everybody started laughing and I felt embarrassed.â€First Lady Laura Bush was involved in planning the memorial service and 
she says she wanted it to be both dignified and comforting. â€œI wanted 
the Psalms and everything to be read to be comforting, because I think 
we were a country, that needed, everyone of us, needed comforting.â€It also stirred the mournersâ€™ resolve, as Rice remember. â€œAs we stood to 
sing the Battle Hymn of the Republic,â€ she says, â€œyou could feel the 
entire congregation and I could certainly feel myself stiffen, the kind 
of spine, and this deep sadness was being replaced by resolve.â€œWe all felt that we still had mourning to do for our countrymen who had 
been lost but that we also had a new purpose in not just avenging what 
had happened to them but making certain that the world was eventually 
going to be safe from this kind of attack ever again.â€Next came a visit to ground zero. The president was not prepared for 
what he encountered there.â€œYou couldnâ€™t brief me, you couldnâ€™t brief anybody on ground zero until 
you saw it,"" Mr. Bush says. â€œIt was like â€“ it was ghostly. Like youâ€™re 
having a bad dream and youâ€™re walking through the dream.â€The president found the scene very powerful, particularly when the men 
and women at ground zero began to chant, â€œUSA! USA!.â€â€œThere was a lot of bloodlust,â€ the president recalls. â€œPeople were, you 
know, pointing their big old hands at me saying, â€˜Donâ€™t you ever forget 
this, Mr. President. Donâ€™t let us down.â€™ The scene was very powerful. 
Very powerful.â€When Mr. Bush tried to speak, the crowd kept shouting, â€œWe canâ€™t hear 
you.â€The president responded, â€œI can hear you. I can hear you. The rest of 
the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down 
will hear all of us soon.â€Mr. Bush had been in New York just a few weeks before; heâ€™d posed with 
the firemen who always stood by whenever the presidentâ€™s helicopter 
landed there. Now, five of the men who stood with the president in the 
picture were dead â€“ lost at ground zero.When the president arrived Sept. 14, Manhattan was papered with the 
faces of the lost. Families, unable to believe that so many had vanished 
in an instant, held onto the hope that their loved ones were just 
missing. It was a place where a child comforted a grieving mother.At a meeting the public never saw, the president spoke with several 
hundred of these families in a convention hall.â€œPeople said to me, â€˜Heâ€™ll come out. Donâ€™t worry, Mr. president, weâ€™ll 
see him soon. I know my loved one, he will - heâ€™ll find a place to 
survive underneath the rubble and weâ€™ll get him out.â€™ I, on the other 
hand had been briefed about the realities, and my job was to hug and 
cry, but I remember the whole time thinking, â€˜This is incredibly sad 
because the loved ones wonâ€™t come out.â€™â€One little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his 
firefighter uniform and as he signed it, Mr. Bush remembers, he told the 
boy, â€œYour daddy wonâ€™t believe that I was here, so you show him that 
autograph.â€It was an effort â€œto provide a little hope,â€ the president recalls. â€œI 
still get emotional thinking about it because weâ€™re dealing with people 
who loved their dads or loved their mom, or loved theirâ€¦wives who loved 
their husbands. It was a tough time, you know, it was a tough time for 
all of us because we were a very emotional, and I was emotional at 
times. I felt, I felt the same now as I did then, which is sad. And I 
still feel sad for those who grieve for their families, but through my 
tears, I see opportunity.â€The president was supposed to be with the families for about 30 minutes; 
he stayed for two and a half hours. It was there he met Arlene Howard. 
The body of her son, George, was among the first to be found at ground 
zero.â€œI called the police department,â€ Howard remembers, â€œ and they said he 
hadnâ€™t called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and I said, 
â€˜No, I donâ€™t need to call back.â€™ If he hadnâ€™t called in, I knew where he 
was.â€George Howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in 1993 
when the World Trade Center was bombed. He had been off duty that day, 
and he was off duty on Sept. 11, but couldnâ€™t stay away. The police 
department gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president.â€œHe (the president) he leaned over to talk to me,â€ Howard recalls. â€œAnd 
he extends his sympathy to me and thatâ€™s when I asked him Iâ€™d like to 
present Georgeâ€™s shield to him in honor of all the men and women who 
were killed over there.â€By the end of that day, Mr. Bush flew to Camp David visibly drained.â€œHe was physically exhausted, he was mentally exhausted, he was 
emotionally exhausted, he was spiritually exhausted,â€ recalls Card..The next day â€“ Saturday, Sept. 15 - Mr. Bush met members of his war 
cabinet at the presidential retreat for a last decisive meeting.â€œMy message is for everybody who wears the uniform â€“ get ready. The 
United States will do what it takes,â€ Mr. Bush told them.As Powell remembers it, â€œHe was encouraging us to think boldly. He was 
listening to all ideas; he was not constrained to any one idea; he 
wanted to hear his advisors talk and argue and debate with each other.â€President Bush was pleased with the progress that had been made. â€œOn the 
other hand,â€ he says, â€œI wanted to clarify plans and I went around the 
room and I asked everybody what they thought ought to happen.â€When he left that meeting on Saturday night, he still had not told the 
cabinet what he was planning.â€œI wanted to just think it through,â€ Mr. Bush remembers. â€œAny time you 
commit troops to harmâ€™s way, a president must make sure that he fully 
understands all the consequences and ramifications. And I wanted to just 
spend some time on it alone. And did.â€What were his reservations?Mr. Bush says, â€œCould we win? I didnâ€™t want to be putting our troops in 
there unless I was certain we could win. And I was certain we could win.â€Nine days after the attacks on America, before a joint session of 
Congress the president committed the nation to the war on terror.â€œEach of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it 
happened,â€ Mr. Bush told the Congress and the nation. â€œWeâ€™ll remember 
the moment the news came, where we were and what we were doing. Some 
will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue. Some will carry 
memories of a face and a voice gone forever. And I will carry this. It 
is the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at the World 
Trade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, 
Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. It is my reminder of lives that 
ended and a task that does not end.â€A year has passed since then, but the president says his job is still to 
remind Americans of what happened and of the war that is still being 
waged, a war he reminds himself of every day in the Oval Office, 
literally keeping score, one terrorist at a time.In his desk, the president says, â€œI have a classified document that 
might have some pictures on there, just to keep reminding me about whoâ€™s 
out there, where they might beâ€And as the terrorists are captures or killed? â€œI might make a little 
check there, yeah,â€ Mr. Bush admits.But there is no check by the name that must be on the top of that list â€“ 
Osama bin Laden.(CBS)Â A lot has happened in the year since Sept. 11. One year ago, the 
president was new on the job, with little experience in foreign policy. 
He had wanted to pull the military back from foreign entanglements. Now, 
on his orders, U.S. forces are engaged around the globe in a war he did 
not expect, in a world completely changed. In the Oval Office last week, 
CBS News Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the president about Iraq, 
about whether Americans are safe at home and about Osama bin Laden.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scott Pelley: You must be frustrated, maybe angry. After a year, we 
still donâ€™t have Osama Bin Laden?President Bush: How do you know that? I donâ€™t know whether Osama bin 
Laden is dead or alive. I donâ€™t know that. Heâ€™s not leading a lot of 
parades. And heâ€™s not nearly the hero that a lot of people thought he 
was. This is much bigger than one person anyway. This is â€” weâ€™re slowly 
but surely dismantling and disrupting the al Qaeda network that, that 
hates America. And we will stay on task until we complete the task. I 
always knew this was a different kind of war, Scott. See, in the old 
days, you measure the size and the strength of the enemy by counting his 
tanks or his airplanes and his ships. This is an international manhunt. 
Weâ€™re after these people one at the time. Theyâ€™re killers. Period.Pelley: But have you won the war before you find Osama bin Laden dead or 
alive?Mr. Bush: If he were dead, thereâ€™s somebody else to replace him. And we 
would find that person. But slowly but surely, we will dismantle the al 
Qaeda network. And those who sponsor them and those who harbor them. And 
at the same time, hopefully lay the seeds for, the conditions necessary 
so that people donâ€™t feel like theyâ€™ve got to conduct terror to achieve 
objectives.Pelley: Do you look back on the Afghan campaign with any doubts? 
Certainly, weâ€™ve overthrown the Taliban government. Certainly, al Qaeda 
has been scattered. But some of the Taliban leaders appear to have 
gotten away. And there have been many civilian casualties as well.Mr. Bush: Uh huh. Well, you know, I am sad that civilians lost their 
life. But I understand war. We did everything we can to â€” everything we 
could to protect people. When civilians did die, it was because of a 
mistake. Certainly not because of intention. We liberated a country for 
which Iâ€™m extremely proud. No, â€” I donâ€™t second guess things. Itâ€™s â€” 
things never go perfect in a time of war.Pelley: Are you committed to ending the rule of Saddam Hussein?Mr. Bush: Iâ€™m committed to regime change.Pelley: There are those who have been vocal in their advice against war 
in Iraq. Some of our allies in the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia, Turkey for 
example. Even your fatherâ€™s former national security advisor, Mr. 
Scowcroft has written about it in the paper. What is it in your 
estimation that they donâ€™t understand about the Iraq question that you 
do appreciate?Mr. Bush: The policy of the government is regime change, Scott, hasnâ€™t 
changed. I get all kinds of advice. Iâ€™m listening to the advice. I 
appreciate the consultations. And weâ€™ll consult with a lot of people but 
our policy hasnâ€™t changed.Pelley: On Air Force One you described the terrorists as evil.Mr. Bush: Yeah.Pelley: I donâ€™t think anyone would disagree with that, but at the same 
time, many in the Arab world are angry at the United States for 
political reasons because of our policy in Israel or our troops in the 
oil region of the Middle East. Is there any change in foreign policy 
that youâ€™re considering that might reduce Arab anger against the United 
States.Mr. Bush: Hmm. Well, Iâ€™m working for peace in the Middle East. Iâ€™m the 
first president that ever went to the United Nations and publicly 
declared the need to have a Palestinian state living side-by-side with 
Israel in peace. Iâ€™ve made it clear that in order for there to be peace 
the Palestinians have gotta to get some leadership that renounces terror 
and believes in peaces and quits using the Palestinian people as pawns. 
I've also made it clear to the other Arab nations in the region that 
theyâ€™ve got responsibilities. If you want peace they gotta work toward 
it. Weâ€™re more than willing to work for it, but they have to work for it 
as well. But all this business isnâ€™t going to happen as long as a few 
are willing to blow up the hopes of many. So we all gotta work to fight 
off terror.Pelley: Arafat has to go?Mr. Bush: Either, heâ€™s, heâ€™s been a complete failure as far as I am 
concerned. Utter disappointment.Pelley: There has been some concern over the year about civil liberties.Mr. Bush: Yeahâ€¦Pelley: In fact, an appeals court recently was harsh about your 
administrationâ€™s decision to close certain deportation hearings. They 
said, quote, â€œA government operating in secrecy stands in opposition to 
the Constitution.â€ Where do you draw the line sir?Mr. Bush: I draw the line at the Constitution. We will protect America. 
But we will do so on, within the guidelines of the Constitution, 
confines of the Constitution, spirit of the Constitution.Pelley: Is there anything that the Justice Department has brought to you 
as an idea that youâ€™ve thought, â€œNo, thatâ€™s too far. I donâ€™t wanna goâ€¦""Mr. Bush: Nah, not that that I remember. And I am pleased with the 
Justice Department. I think that Attorney Generalâ€™s doing a fine job, by 
the way...and to the extent that our courts are willing to make sure 
that they review decisions we make, I think thatâ€™s fine. I mean, thatâ€™s 
good. Itâ€™s healthy. Itâ€™s part of America.Pelley: Franklin Roosevelt said that America should stand in defense of 
four freedoms. Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want 
and freedom from fear. Do we have that today Mr. President? Freedom from 
fear?Mr. Bush: I think more than we did, in retrospect. The fact that we are 
on alert, the fact that we understand the new circumstances makes us 
more free from fear than on that fateful day of September the 11th. 
Weâ€™ve got more work to do.Pelley: And Americans should not live their lives in fear?Mr. Bush: I donâ€™t think so. No. I think Americans oughta know their 
governmentâ€™s doing everything possible to help. And obviously if we get 
information that relates directly a particular attack weâ€™ll deal with 
it. And if we get noise that deals with a general attack, weâ€™ll alert 
people. There are a lot of good folks working hard to disrupt and deny 
and run down leads. And the American people need to go about their 
lives. It seems like they are.

( creole : collection of reusable objects for language engineering . currently creole supports only algortihmic objects , but will be extended to data objects . ) a common model of language data resources would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs . at the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources ( e . g . lexicons are about words ) ; at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources . programmatic access would be available at all levels , allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an exciting element of the work could be to provide algorithms to dynamically merge common resources ( e . g . connect wordnet to celex ) , what we ' re suggesting initially is not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to existing resources . this is not a new standards initiative , but a way to build on previous initiatives . of course , the production of a common model that fully expressed all the subtleties of all resources would be a large undertaking , but we believe that it can be done incrementally , with useful results at each stage . early versions will stop decomposing the object structure of resources at a fairly high level , leaving the developer to handle the data structures native to the resources at the leaves of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucures . draft program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilks hamish cunningham wim peters remi zajac roberta catizone paola velardi maria teresa pazienza louise guthrie roberto basili bran boguraev sergei nirenburg james pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum paper submission - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - formatting guidelines : papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . hard copies : three hard copies should be sent to : gill callaghan , fao yorick wilks dept . computer science university of sheffield regent court 211 portobello st . , sheffield s1 4dp uk electronic submission : electronic submission will be allowed in poscript or html . an ftp site will be available on demand . authors should send an info email to ( hamish cunningham - hamish @ dcs . shef . ac . uk ) even if they submit in paper form . an electronic submission should be accompanied by a plain ascii text . # name : name of first author # title : title of the paper # pages : number of pages # files : name of file ( if also submitted electronically ) # note : anything you 'd like to add # keys : keywords # email : email of the first author # abstr : abstract of the paper # . . . . . . important dates paper submission deadline ( hard copy / electronic ) march 15th 1998 paper notification april 1st camera - ready papers due may 1st dalr workshop may 27st",Safe Email

Date: 2002-10-08T16:39:48-06:00=== Scissors === I, like most other people here, went through the security checkpoint. Unlike 
everyone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for 
permission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a 
box of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket 
was suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing.     The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my 
    lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. She put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They 
took everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used 
the opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked 
back up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying ""This can't 
go on board."" ""I don't remember packing that,"" I said. I let her confiscate it. I called my Mom. She doesn't remember packing it either. Is there some sort of 
terrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people's suitcases? I 
can't see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I'm on? Once 
I'm on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but 
if they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the 
scissors? Perhaps it's some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their 
fists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky 
mouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, 
they use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they 
use the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever 
terrorists. *Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was 
using to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The 
nation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert.  === Waiting for Wireless === Now I am at O'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral's Club while 
businessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I 
used last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, 
I had an Admiral's Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite 
the airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, 
you know)--I doubt they will accept it. === Irony === According to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his 
flight. I think of what I'd say if I ran into him. ""Jack!"" I'd exclaim, as if we were 
old pals. ""Going to the Eldred case?"" Of course he was. ""Going to be a good 
one."" ""Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?"" I'd ask. ""You said 
you were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the 
Internet. What ever happened to that?"" I imagine him mumbling and looking down 
at his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. Another announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing 
these airline announcements keep me up to date. === Automatic Flush Toilets === Now I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In 
the first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little 
short...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle 
one mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three 
times. This is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they 
expect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied 
immediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer's web 
site. === Arrival === I've arrived in D.C.--once again, I'm sitting a block away from my hotel on the 
sidewalk borrowing someone's connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with 
Lisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now

I assisted Late President Laurent Kabila to keep US$35M (Thirty Five Millions) in a Security company during the War in My Country.  Although the security company does not know the content in the boxes deposited as we deposit it as personal effects of Mr. Laurent Kabila. It is in this respect that I seek your help to assist me in the investment of these funds before the present Government headed by the son will have knowledge of this money to avoid being taking away. On conclusion of this business, I shall compensate you with 45% of the fund, while 5% is mapped out for any expense we should encounter during the cause of transaction, and the remaining amount should be used to open account for my family for investment over there with your assistance. I need a profitable long-term investment plan with your company or you. Your terms, suggestions and ideas are required urgently. Expecting your prompt response. Also furnish me with your current E-mail address, Tel/Fax Numbers (Private) for a personal contact with you. NOTE: Please you can call or fax to the line above, it belong to my cousin, as he know the confidentiality, you can reach me direct on my mail above.  Yours Faithfully,

"the pain""Ken never wrote about this method, but he often demonstrated it in workshops. Let us say you have a physical pain somewhere in your body. You draw the pain in the air with your finger, about 30 cm (1 foot) high. Take about 60 seconds to trace around the perimeter of the pain, carefully listening to the pain to find the precise boundary between where it hurts and where it does not. Repeat. You will find that after about 10 minutes of this the pain will shift, shrink or disappear. A variant of this is to imagine making a 3D model the pain in coloured clay.""Works! There's this coworker - a real pain in my ass! I used my middle finger to trace his outline for about 60 seconds. I listened to him, found the boundary, and repeated the motion. He left my office! -----Original Message----- From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com]On Behalf Of Stephen D. Williams Sent: Thursday, October 03, 2002 5:33 PM To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org Subject: Living Love - Another legacy of the 60's Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated with fairly good ideas. Just a big turnoff. A good example would be the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"", hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc. (This was one of the many topics I obsessively absorbed as a teenager.) Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / G-Force Dyno-Staff.I have to say however that, having found this while looking for something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms. I particularly like their addiction to non-addiction. Additionally, the Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize. Very irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and contrast with our (my) modern mental models.I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.http://mindprod.com/methods.html http://members.aol.com/inossence/Kenkey.html http://www.mindprod.com/ (Apologies for the embedded HTML.)We create the world we live in. A loving person lives in a loving world, A hostile person lives in a hostile world. Everyone you meet is your mirror.You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence as when you give offence. To be upset over what you don't have is to waste what you do have.The past is dead, The future is imaginary, Happiness can only be in the Eternal Now MomentHow soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have.Love a person because he or she is there. This is the only reason.Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.The purpose of our lives is to be free of all addictive traps, and thus become one with the ocean of Living Love. sdw-- sdw@lig.net http://sdw.st Stephen D.

> a symptom of that.Socialism increases regulation which increases corruption.  But that
doesn't matter as much as if the official law does not conform to the
facts on the ground.If you don't match the law to the facts on the ground, you wind up with
a two-tier society (De Soto's Bell Jar).  Worse, the massive evasion of
the official law encourages the corruption you speak of.In some countries, the agencies in charge of registering property also
arrange for illegal living arrangements for their employees.  They do
this because even the people who run the system can't make it work for
people they care about.

"" the author shows that a proper understanding of the properties of p-movement can be attained within the framework of the minimalist program . maria luisa zubizarreta is associate professor at the university of southern california . linguistic inquiry monograph 33 august 1998 6 x 9 , 232 pp . , 4 illus . paper isbn 0-262 - 74021 - 4 cloth isbn 0-262 - 24041 - 6 jud wolfskill associate publicist phone : ( 617 ) 253-2079 mit press fax : ( 617 ) 253-1709 five cambridge center e - mail : wolfskil @ mit . edu cambridge , ma 02142-1493 http : / / mitpress . mit . edu",Safe Email

( i will be glad to put this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move forward . ) i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to earn and secure your business . if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest you begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1 day training seminar . our clients are usually very fluent after that 1 day training seminar . thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks later . thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted . dale nesbitt president marketpoint inc . 27121 adonna ct . los altos hills , ca 94022 ( 650 ) 218 - 3069 dale . nesbitt @ marketpointinc . com - license . doc",Safe Email

Stop.   It appears that this comes from the ""inst_cfs:"" part of the Makefile,
which copies local.cf into /etc/mail/spamassassin.  The Makefile has
brackets around the -f test, but they don't show up above.  Any ideas?Jim

clues.  But that's wrong too!  It looks I haven't grokked this part of
your code yet; this one has way more than 16 clues, and it seems the
classifier basically ended up counting way more 0.99 than 0.01 clues,
and no others made it into the list.  I thought it was looking for
clues with values in between; apparently it found none that weren't
exactly 0.5?> That sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues!This happened to be the longest one, but there were quite a few
similar ones.  I wonder if there's anything we can learn from looking
at the clues and the HTML.  It was heavily marked-up HTML, with ads in
the sidebar, but the body text was a serious discussion of ""OO and
soft coding"" with lots of highly technical words as clues (including
Zope and ZEO).> That there are *any* 0.50 clues in here means the scheme ran out of

been safe in the first place because SpamAssassin 2.31-and-before doesn't
do any kind of file locking while it writes to the mailbox and doesn't
promise to return the proper failure code on disk-full conditions, etc.If you're still willing to live with (b), all you need is a little shell
script to run spamassassin:----------
#!/bin/sh
# call this file ""spamassassin-wrapper"" and chmod +x it
{
echo ""From $1 `date`""
sed -e '1{/^From /d;}' | spamassassin
echo ''
} >> $MAIL
----------And then usefetchmail --mda 'spamassassin-wrapper %F'and you should be all set.-------------------------------------------------------

"tei report , call for proposals the future of the tei report and final invitation for proposals 1 background information as reported on this list in early september , the text encoding initiative is considering options for its future organization and funding , and is actively exploring the possibility of a consortium or cooperative organization to support the maintenance and extension of the tei guidelines . on 3 - 4 october , the tei executive committee met with representatives of the tei 's sponsoring organizations ( ach , acl , and allc ) and of some prospective host institutions . the purpose of this note is - to report to the community on the steps being taken toward the goal of a new organization for the tei , - to outline for all concerned the current schedule of events leading toward a final decision , and - to reiterate the invitation for institutions interested in hosting a tei organization to contact the tei as soon as possible , in order to ensure that any proposals can receive full consideration . 2 issues list in the course of the meeting , we elaborated a list of issues which must be resolved in the course of any decision on the tei 's future organization and structure ; any proposal for organizing and hosting a tei structure is expected to address these questions . - intellectual property rights : the tei 's sponsoring organizations are taking steps to clarify the current status of rights in the tei ; any new structure needs to make clear how those rights are to be managed in the future . there is a strong conviction that in any new organizational structure the results of the tei 's work must remain publicly accessible , as they are now . - the governance and legal status of the proposed organization must be described . it is essential that the legal structure be one that allows full participation by institutions and individuals from all countries ; in particular , institutions in the european and north american countries where tei activity and use are currently most common should be on an equal footing . - proposals need to specify a plausible business plan and indicate the level of fees and other funding needed to make the proposed organization self-sustaining . the executive committee and sponsoring organizations have no particular requirements on this topic ( beyond the hope that membership fees not be prohibitively expensive ) ; prospective hosts must take into account the cultural differences between europe and america as regards fees for membership in consortia and cooperative organizations . - geography : there is a strong wish that the international flavor of the tei be maintained with regard to the membership , governance , and provision of service by a tei organization . - the tei has developed a structure and a set of procedures for organizing and carrying out the intellectual work of maintaining the guidelines ; proposals for the tei 's future need to specify in how far these procedures will be retained , and how they will be changed . - proposals for a tei organization should contain provisions describing what is to happen if the organization is unsuccessful ; such a fall-back plan should provide among other things for the reversion of the tei to the original sponsoring organizations . - the future role of the current sponsoring organizations in the future guidance of the tei must be spelled out . there is , in principle , a broad range of possibilities here ; in practice , the current sponsoring organizations wish to have some active role in the governance of the tei , at least for some initial period - - both in order to ensure continuity in the project and to demonstrate their continuing support for the tei and its goals . - the scope of the proposed organization or cooperative must also be clear - - where 's cope ' may be described in terms of discipline , or of type of activity , or of the common bases or foci of activities . the sponsoring organizations recognize that standards of many kinds may be relevant to the activities of their members , and they expect to continue collaborating with each other on standards of mutual concern . whatever institutional and organizational framework is set up for the tei must be in a position to collaborate flexibly with future initiatives of the sponsoring organizations ( as well as continuing the tei 's involvement in work on related standards like xml ) . 3 timetable the timetable for the decision about the future organization of the tei is as follows : 31 october 1998 : initial proposals should be received from prospective hosts . november 1998 : a review committee consisting of the tei executive committee and additional representatives from the sponsoring organizations will review and discuss the proposals and ask proposers for explanations and clarification of matters of detail in the proposals . 30 november 1998 : cut-off for the discussion process , and deadline for submission of revised proposals , with full institutional commitments . early to mid - december 1998 : a short list of proposals will be selected , and proposers will be notified and invited to give final presentations at a meeting in january 1999 . mid - january 1999 : meeting of review committee to receive final presentations , following which the sponsoring organizations will decide the future arrangements for the tei . 31 january 1999 : public announcement of the decision made by the sponsoring organizations will be made by the end of january . 4 invitation institutions interested in proposing to organize and host a tei organization ( or to make any other proposal for the future of the tei ) should contact the tei secretariat as soon as possible at the address below for further information , since initial proposals are expected at the end of october , and final proposals , including full institutional commitments , are due 30 november . members of the sponsoring organizations , or other users of the tei , who would like to express their views on any of the issues outlined above , or to suggest other issues that should be considered , are invited to comment on tei - l , or to contact the appropriate bodies within their association , or to write directly to the tei executive committee in care of the address below . - c . m . sperberg - mcqueen , university of illinois at chicago lou burnard , oxford university tei secretariat : c . m . sperberg - mcqueen , tei @ uic . edu",Safe Email

  Meetings Leader WebEx Communications
  To Provide Best-of-Breed Solution For Extended Group Collaboration During
  and Between Online Meetings  Web meetings raise the quality of team interaction and communications for
  users of the Web's secure, P2P collaboration network  ###  Tadpole Technology plc, the mobile computing and network infrastructure
  group, today announces that its web collaboration subsidiary, Endeavors
  Technology, Inc., has teamed with Web meetings leader, WebEx
  Communications,Inc. to help professionals make better use of corporate time
  and resources, and gain competitive advantage. By integrating the advanced
  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P
  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class
  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this
  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around
  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience
  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how
  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between
  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple
  copies of constantly changing documents.  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of
  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit
  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than
  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured
  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also
  essential.  Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for
  sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be
  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be
  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules
  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at
  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,
  inside or outside company firewalls.  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web
  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at
  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or
  ""present."" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across
  other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents
  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx
  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,
  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.  ""In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed
  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,"" says
  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. ""The powerful combination
  of Endeavors' Magi and WebEx's communications technologies will assist
  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by
  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings.""  ""WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,
  training, support and product design,"" says David Farrington, vice president
  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. ""By integrating the

   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Read it like this: new array with 1024 elements of type pointer to char.
As a pointer occupies the natural word size (32 bits or 64bits), no wonder
you get 4*1024 (sizeof(char *) * numer_of_elements).>  int len = sizeof(testbuff);

sizeof returns the size of types. You can use it with vars (and then the
normal form is sizeof var, not sizeof(var)), but if you're changing the
type with the var with a cast, of course you'll get the size of that new
type.Regards,

"URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020912.html
Date: Not suppliedWe're trying to decide if FogBUGZ[1] 3.0 should support custom fields. 
Historically, I am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get 
abused. People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything 
they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard. 
End result: people don't enter bugs, which is much, much worse than not 
capturing all that information. You can always ""page fault"" to get the 
information if the original report forgot it. Rather than having a field in 
every bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine 
(this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be 
relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the 
programmer-assignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be 
dll-version-related, only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking 
for the DLL info? Similarly, it's always tempting to add a field in which you 
ask for the OS version in which the bug occurred. This sounds logical, but 
trust me: adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing 
only: reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first 
place. Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can 
always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be 
relevant. (But then how do you search for, say, all bugs which only happen on 
Windows 98SE? Aha! You can't. Ever. Even with the custom field. Because not 
every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system, so 
this search doesn't make sense in the first place. The info wasn't captured. Do 
a full text search for 98SE and you'll find some of them. Life is imperfect.) Life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of 
information -- a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in RAM on 
the computer in question and while you're at it, a photograph of the tester's 
workspace. But the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_, 
which, all else being equal, takes priority over making it easy to find them. I 
have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking 
package was so high-ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the 
system, because they didn't know what all those fields were. The _real_ 
bug-""tracking"" happened in email, post-its, and hallway conversations. Great. A pretty common question we get on the customer service line is, ""does 
FogBUGZ support custom fields?"" Rather than giving our usual answer (""no. on 
purpose."") over the last few weeks I've been saying, ""can you please tell me 
what fields you would need? We're trying to decide whether to implement that 
feature in 3.0 and we want to know why people need it."" The interesting thing 
is, almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in FogBUGZ,_ and the 
other ones, in my educated opinion, shouldn't be fields. And in fact, our 
existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields. One of our 
biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company, and I myself wanted 
to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design, 
but I didn't, and they never needed it (even though they had been keeping track 
of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields), and they are 
happy and keep buying more site licenses. But the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking 
software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in 
our product. ""Gosh, even Filemaker has custom fields."" Righto. It's true. And 
who am I to tell my customers they are wrong? One person who I was talking to 
yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a 
built-in field for. This would have made their database confusing and 
inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved. But 
it's still rude of me to tell customers that we don't have that feature _for 
their own good_, even though it usually is, and we're losing some sales because 
of it. Sigh. I guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so 
hard to use that people don't use it. At least we won't lose any sales :)[1] http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ

http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992620""Carbon dioxide turned into hydrocarbon fuel 
(((Please, no immediate lectures on the second law of 
thermodynamics. I have plenty of those.)))""16:00ï¿½02ï¿½Augustï¿½02""A way to turn carbon dioxide into hydrocarbons has caused 
a big stir at an industrial chemistry conference in New 
Brunwick, New Jersey. Nakamichi Yamasaki of the Tokushima 
Industrial Technology Center in Japan says he has a 
process that makes propane and butane at relatively low 
temperatures and pressures.""Link: Yes, he actually exists:
http://www.it.sakura.ne.jp/~koatsu/c_journal/ab/1_10/01-2.html
http://www.itc.pref.tokushima.jp/English/eindex.html""Making fuel from greenhouse gases""While his work still needs independent verification,  
(((okay, go fetch us some, then))) if he can make even 
heavier hydrocarbons, it might be possible to make petrol. 
It has carbon chains that are between five and 12 atoms 
long == butane is four atoms long.  (((""That's right, 
Professor: I just hook it up to the sky and I make 
gasoline!"")))   ""The work suggests the tantalising prospect that CO2, 
the main greenhouse gas, could be recycled instead of 
being pumped into the atmosphere.    ""Many people have tried before to make hydrocarbons by 
mixing carbon with hydrogen gas in a reaction chamber at 
very high temperatures, but yields have always been 
pitiful. Yamasaki has used hydrochloric acid as his source 
of hydrogen ions. (((""But where are we s'posed to get all 
that hydrochloric acid?"" Yes, I know, I know.)))    ""He bubbles the CO2 into a reaction vessel where it is 
heated to about 300 C at 100 times atmospheric pressure. 
The heat and pressure are low enough, says Yamasaki, to 
make it feasible to scale up the reaction so it can run on 
a power station's waste heat. (((Imagine the fun when a 
giant tank of pressurized acid blows up.)))""Iron powder    ""Using iron powder as a catalyst, Yamasaki says he has 
made substantial amounts of methane, ethane, propane and 
butane, which he was able to vent off as gases when the 
mixture cooled. If he can improve the catalyst's 
performance he is hopeful of making heavier hydrocarbons 
such as petrol, too.     ""William Siegfried, who has lead similar experiments 
at the University of Minnesota in the twin cities of 
Minneapolis and St Paul, says his group was only able to 
make methane at far higher temperatures. But his process 
also used a nickel-based alloy as a catalyst, rather than 
iron.    ""Siegfried's group was investigating whether natural 
methane deposits might have formed chemically with the 
metal in rocks acting as a catalyst rather than forming 
from the decay of rotting biological material over aeons.  
(((Paging Thomas Gold! ""Deep Hot Biosphere"" calling on 
line one.)))   ""Unless Yamasaki's technology can make the more 
valuable heavier hydrocarbons such as petroleum, which are 
liquid at room temperature, it will not be much more use 
than present-day bioreactors, in which bacteria that like 
to feed on CO2 are induced to produce methane. 'Organisms 
have a special talent for that kind of reaction,' says

Big cats are on the loose in Britain and breeding their way towards record
numbers, a monitoring group has claimed. 
The British Big Cats Society said it has received more than 800 reports of
animals including pumas, black panthers, leopards and so-called Fen tigers
over the past 12 months. And while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the
average moggy, it claims to have ""firm evidence"" that the majority are real.
Society founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with the
critics and doubters, adding: ""I was a sceptic, I thought it was in the same
realm as the Loch Ness monster. ""But it's not, they are really out there."" 'Cats with cubs' Mr Bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of the
country. Big cat reports  
Hotspots include Scotland and Gloucestershire 
January 2002 - Kent man clawed by suspected Lynx 
November 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat 
April 2001 - Lynx captured in north London 
1999 - Puma-like cat attacks horse in Wales  
""This weekend alone I have had sightings from Wales, the Scottish borders,
Kent, the West Midlands, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire,"" he said. The society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. But Mr Bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist in
sufficient numbers to breed among themselves. ""We have had sightings of cats with cubs,"" he added. 'Trigger camera' The society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence, including
photographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. But it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public
that it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. A national ""trigger camera"" project is planned which, the society hopes,
will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. Mr Bamping said: ""The idea is that the cat will walk past the camera and
take a picture of itself."" 'Like dogs' The society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the
wild, or their descendants. Its spokesman Danny Nineham said: ""In the 1960s and 1970s, people had big
cats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs. ""But in 1976 when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act came into force, people
released their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put them
down, or take them to a zoo.""------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

Techs fall with consumer sentiment
A drop in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index helped put a dent in technology shares Friday.Despite Dell Computer raising its outlook and better-than-expected earnings from Juniper Networks, CNET's Tech index slipped 5.12 points, or 0.51 percent, to 990.0. The tech-packed Nasdaq composite index edged down 0.94 points, or 0.06 percent, to 1,373.49.Broader markets also fell, as investors shrugged off news of better-than-expected retail and food services sales in June. The Dow Jones industrials shed 117 points, or 1.33 percent, to 8,684.5--its fifth straight losing session. The S&P 500 lost 5.98 points, or 0.64 percent, to 921.39.
Rivals help improve Dell's outlook 
Dell Computer on Thursday raised its revenue and earnings outlook for the second quarter, saying it continues to gain market share from computer rivals.
The company said it now expects revenue for the quarter that ends Aug. 2 will reach $8.3 billion, up about 9 percent from last year's second quarter, with earnings of 19 cents per share. On May 16, the company predicted revenue would hit $8.2 billion and projected earnings at 18 cents per share.DELL COMPUTER CORP 24.98 4.39% Lukewarm response to Juniper moves 
Juniper Networks continues to muddle through the telecom morass.
Juniper beat estimates by earning less than $500,000, reported a 42 percent decline in year-over-year sales and offered little hope that it could grow its business when it reported 2002 second-quarter earnings Thursday. Yet in some corners of the industry, Juniper's performance was viewed as mildly positive. JUNIPER NETWORKS 7.70 6.65% Asia proves sweet spot for Yahoo
Web portal Yahoo, which broke a long streak of losses in the second quarter, said it hopes to ride on Asia's acceptance of online advertising and focus on wireless content to boost its regional business.
""Asian advertisers who use traditional media like newspapers and TV are moving more into online ads as they see the value and efficiency that it delivers,"" Niren Hiro, Yahoo's general manager for Southeast Asia, said in an interview Thursday. ""That's why we've seen in the last quarter clients who have traditionally stayed away from new media like us starting to divert their budgets in our direction.""YAHOO INC 12.9400 0.15479876%

J.P. Morgan downgrades Powerwave Technologies to ""long-term buy"" in tech notes 7/12/02 
Analyst Ed Snyder lowers his rating from ""buy"" despite a strong quarter from the wireless communications gear maker. Powerwave has a diversified customer base and fewer competitors now, Snyder suggests. But he cuts his estimates and rating based on lower guidance from the company, weak third-generation (3G) wireless network orders, and likely cuts in carrier capital expenditures. The infrastructure market remains lumpy and hard to predict, Snyder says.POWERWAVE TECHNOLOGIES 6.61 -13.03%

AOL on the hunt for new CEO 
AOL Time Warner has begun casting a net for a chief executive for its beleaguered America Online division.
The move comes as no surprise. Former AOL CEO Barry Schuler stepped down from the position in April. But it raises questions about the future of Robert Pittman, AOL Time Warner's chief operating officer and the interim head of AOL. Pittman had been charged with fixing the division. As previously reported, sources in the company speculate that Pittman will not return to his duties as COO once he completes his stint at AOL.AOL TIME WARNER INC 13.14 -4.09%

I actually hear about this from people who are researchers in
pharma-biotech.  My authority isn't much better than ""they say"", but they
say that they've uncovered quite a few advantageous mutations in the ethnic
European genome that protect against quite a few different diseases,
mutations which are not found in various African, Asian, and other
populations that they also study.  Based on the genome research (as it
relates to infectious disease, which is among their primary interests) of
these various populations around the world, they and others are finding far
more protective mutations in the Caucasian/European genome than in the other
race populations they survey.  All the races and ethnic subgroups usually
have genetic mutations specific to them that provide protection against
specific infectious diseases.  What they are saying is that they are finding
far more in the European genome than in the others, and it isn't because
nobody is looking elsewhere.You can find studies and results like this in the science wires.  For
example, one which I remember off the top of my head is the identified
genetic mutation that makes something like 1% of Caucasians immune to HIV-1,
and another 10-20% or so resistant to it.  Obviously, the protective
mutation occurred at some point in time prior to HIV-1 being introduced into
the European population.  What the researchers I've talked to seem to be
saying is that Europeans express a lot more of these types of gene
mutations, with similar protections from infectious disease, than other
populations.  Nobody really knows why for sure.  On the upside, identifying
genetic immunities to infectious disease helps the bio-techs come up with
pharmacological solutions for people that don't have immunity.-James Rogers

"two summaries i apologize for being so negligent in posting these summaries to questions i asked 6 weeks ago . the responses were plentiful and very useful , and quick ! congratulations go to james vanden bosch ( vand @ calvin . edu ) and rob pensalfini ( rjpensal @ mit . edu ) who answered my questions on french loan words and language evolution before i had even received the posting from linguistlist . wow . the figure i had remembered was that some 10 , 000 words were borrowed from french into english . as most people said , it comes from baugh , albert c . ( 1951 ) , _ a history of the eng lang _ , 2nd edn . routledge & kegan paul , london , p . 215 . which was basically the only place i had n't looked . other interesting information : p . 327 "" according to jespersen , nearly half ( 42 . 7 percent ) of the french borrowing in english to ca . 1900 belong to this [ 1250-1400 ] period . 36 . > from thomas pyles , the origins and development of the english language . ny : harcourt brace jovanovich 1971 , 2nd ed . pyles is quoting ( his footnote 36 ) : jesperson , growth and structure of the english language , 9th ed . oxford 1954 ( orig . pub . 1905 ) . other references : coleman , julie ( 1995 ) the chronology of french and latin loan words in english . _ transactions of the philological society _ 93 , 95-124 . there are further references there . there 's also a recent book , i think , by christiane dalton - puffer . steve seegmiller wrote : the total number of borrowings from french is certainly much higher that 10 , 000 - probably ten times that number or more , if you count the word in an unabridged dictionary ( rather than , say , the 20 , 000 most common words ) . i have heard figures ( perhaps from jespersen again , i ' m not sure ) to the effect that 80 % of all of the words in are borrowings , and 80 % of those are from french and latin . > from terry nadasdi i just saw your posting on linguist . i do n't have an exact reference , just a suggestion of where you might consider looking . i just had a look at my m . a . thesis which was on english loan words in canadian french . i have a quote there which suggests that w . d . whitney might be a place you could look . the quote is as follows : "" rarely has any cultivated tongue , during a like period of history given up more of its ancient material than did the english during the few centuries which succeeded the norman invasion . . . "" this quote by whitney was taken from a . elliot , 1889 in an article entitled "" speech mixture in french canada "" , american journal of philology , vol . x , 2 "" speech mixture in french canada "" , american journal of philology , vol . x , 2 no . 38 . p . 158-186 . i unfortunately no longer have the article with me , but your library should have it in order that you might find the original whitney source which give actual numbers of loan words from french to english . thanks again to ( in no particular order ) : roslyn blyn - ladrew ( jladrew @ chesco . com ) david denison ( mfcepdd @ fs1 . art . man . ac . uk ) steve seegmiller ( seegmillerm @ alpha . montclair . edu ) terry nadasdi ( tnadasdi @ gpu . srv . ualberta . ca ) burns cooper ( ffgbc @ aurora . alaska . edu ) w . h . edmondson ( w . h . edmondson @ cs . bham . ac . uk ) terry lynn irons ( t . irons @ morehead-st . edu ) ( and anyone else i missed ) this was my original second posting about the evolution of languages : > i once read that the natural evolution of a language is from > analytic to synthetic . i ' ve been unable to find that assertion > since , and am wondering if i made it up . replies to this open question were much more varied and i ' ll quote them all . > from rob pensalfini ( rjpensal @ mit . edu ) : i can't comment on who might have said it , but it has probably been said . i think english serves as a counterexample to some degree , where you had a highly inflecting language that lost a lot of its inflection ( verbal and nominal ) and now uses prepositions et al where case marking would have once done the work . i always imagined it as a circle , so that a fully isolating language might start to incorporate certain things and over the centuries become synthetic , polysynthetic even ( incorporating not only adpositions but pronominal arguments ) . eventually , some of the distinctions encoded in the inflection might be lost , some of the inflection might be lost altogether , and then the language ( we ' re talking centuries later again ) might use independent words ( perhaps adverbials or something ) to indicate particular grammatical relations , and lo and behold you ' ve got an isolating language again . the fact that change in either direction is possible is why there are two sides to debates on things like what the ancestor australian language ( s ) might have looked like . australia has both head marking ( polysynthetic ) languages and dependent ( case - ) marking languages , as well as languages that are a mixture of the two . some people think that the original language was dependent marking and that truncation and cliticisation of pronouns led to head-marking ( ken hale and i are among these people ) , while other people take the equally valid view that the ancestor was synthetic and that case marking developed in conjunction with the loss of head marking . hope this was of some use , rob carl mills ( carl . mills @ uc . edu ) wrote : i do n't know who made up this "" theory , "" but they are probably wrong . on this view , what happened to english between ca . 800 and ca . 1500 ? ? > from peter daniels ( pdaniels @ press-gopher . uchicago . edu ) : there are some remarks on this in the new book by anatole lyovin , * introduction to the languages of the world * ( oxford , 1997 ) ; i do n't remember whether he gives references . but the notion of progress between types is certainly found in max muller . i believe it was folks like boas who laid it to rest ; meanwhile the romance future formation cycle had been noticed , and if high - class languages like latin and french could oscillate between analytic and synthetic , then obviously it could n't be an evolutionary sequence ! > from john halloran ( seagoat @ pop . primenet . com ) : a trend from agglutinative to inflective was identified by bernard h . bichakjian in his article "" evolutionary patterns in linguistics "" which appeared in studies in language origins , vol 2 , ed . walburga von raffler - engel , jan wind , and abraham jonker ( amsterdam / philadelphia : john benjamins , 1991 ) , pp . 187-224 . he also identifies some other trends in linguistic evolution . geoffrey sampson ( geoffs @ cogs . susx . ac . uk ) wrote : my memory is that adalbert schleicher , who was the first writer to describe language evolution as a natural process akin ( or even identical ) to biological evolution , thought of the movement from analytic to synthetic as a decay which came about after the intellectual progress of mankind had attained a point at which it no longer needed to be supported by specific linguistic structures - - and that this was linked to themes in hegel 's philosophy , about which i am deeply vague . > from ian dale ( iandale @ ccs . carleton . ca ) : i take it you are referring in the first instance to wilhelm von humboldt . a few quick references . edward sapir ( language , 1921 , chapter 6 ) deals rather extensively with a rather more detailed typological comparison , without specific reference to humboldt . charles f . hockett ( 1958 , a course in modern linguistics , p181 ) dismisses such ideas out of hand , without giving a reference . r . h . robins ( 1964 , general linguistics : an introductory survey , pp 331 - 335 ) also discusses this sort of classification and does refer specifically to humboldt 's "" ueber die verschiedenheit des menschlichen sprachbaues , berlin , 1836 ( reprinted darmstadt , 1949 . "" but as to any sort of "" natural evolution "" , all ( and i imagine this "" all "" would include nearly all linguists ) agree that this is out of the question , especially if "" evolution "" has anything to do with "" progress , "" and especially since most languages display both synthetic and analytic features ( not to speak of such other terms as polysynthetic , agglutinative , isolating , and inflecting ) . > from asya pereltsvaig ( asya @ mail . netvision . net . il ) hi , i do n't know if it 's of any help to you or it will just confuse you , but i remember reading somewhere of just the opposite approach : that languages develop from synthetic to analytic . however , i can't address you to a reference right now . laurie bauer ( laurie . bauer @ vuw . ac . nz ) writes : if it is , the history of romance from latin needs some explanation - - or english from germanic , for that matter . yet if you consider french le livre , je l ' ai lu , moi in terms of phonology instead of traditional word breaks , we could argue that we have le _ livre je _ l ' ai _ lu moi in three words , the middle one of which is synthetic , derived from a more analytic j ' ai lu le livre . so we find both directions occurring naturally . whew ! thanks to everyone . this has shown me that there is no simple answer and that i should just as likely believe the opposite as what i thought i had read . m melanie misanchuk department of french italian and spanish university of calgary calgary , alberta , canada",Safe Email

"Hi,	I'm no longer able to play encrypted dvd's using the xine rpm from freshrpms. 
I think it was about a week ago when I last rented some dvd's, worked just 
fine, but apparently since the latest xine update on freshrpms, it won't 
anymore. 
The output is :input_dvd: Sorry, this plugin doesn't play encrypted DVDs. The legal status
           of CSS decryption is unclear and we can't provide such code.
           Please check http://dvd.sf.net for more information.I'm pretty sure it worked with the previous freshrpms release... Any way of 
rolling back updates ?Nick Verhaegen_______________________________________________

behavior would be to unsubscribe razor-users@fsckit.net from the mailing 
list.But in any case, you have to understand that you and him would not be 
the only one involved. As I said in a another thread, you probably get 
hurt only if you are against the majority of people (which makes sense). 
If you are with the majority, you get a bonus (which also makes sense). 
If there is no majority, nobody wins or lose.
Razor is designed for the betterment of most people, i.e. the majority, 
not for the individual. If one doesn't agree with the majority, he 
should use the razor-whitelist or create a blacklist (BTW, why doesn't 
razor provide a razor-blacklist too?)	Jehan-------------------------------------------------------

""Habeas Infringers List"", and if you use their trademark without 
their permission, you'll end up on it.  Then, when you send spam 
with the misappropriated header, users of SA (2.40 supports 
this) will tag your mail as spam, rather than let it through. 
This may be done independantly of your IP address, so be 
prepared to constantly change domain names, and move your 
servers as fast as you send spam.Also, that little haiku is a copyrighted work, so not only CAN 
Habeas sue, they MUST sue to protect their copyright. And since 
it's a trademark as well, that's a double-whammy. Habeas has 
some pretty high-powered legal people, who will gladly go to 
town on violators.The whole point here is to give them the legal leverage they 
need to put spammers out of business, and not only block mail 
from them, but allow through the things that really AREN'T spam.--B-------------------------------------------------------

"re : 6 . 137 ipa hac ( h ) ek = little hook . is n't the reason why so many "" amerricanists "" used the hac ( h ) ek , especially for the two major affricates in english , related to the fact that these affricates in english function not as two things but as one thing ? now i am a bit confused , because i had usually used the word "" wedge "" for the diacritic above the "" c "" and the "" j "" - not "" hacek .

"Hello People,I am new to SA but (2) problems I do have.I run SA from my own home for personal use and it seems to work but I see this

missing something major because I've also had my setting checked/verified.The problem is that the site-wide setup does NOT seem to work. Why?1. I have my local.cf in /etc/mail/spamassassin

  deliver to enginngware in domain runjiri.co.ke
  director = spamcheck_director, transport = spamcheck
However when I check the mail delivered to this mailbox, SA has _not_ added any headers
to it.PERTINENT: I also run a Virus Scanner called DRWEB via Exim's system filter and the rules
that I have applied are:if not first_delivery or
    $received_protocol is ""drweb-scanned"" or
    $received_protocol is ""spam-scanned""
then
  finish
endif
Some enlightenment would bail me out, I believe.Thanks-Wash--

"While I was playing with the past issues, it annoyed me that there was
no easy way to make the log stop growing (I don't mean to truncate it,
I mean to just freeze it for a while).The following patch adds a new button to the log window, which allows
the log to be switched on/off (the button says ""Disable"" when the
log is enabled, and the button disables it, and ""Enable"" when the log
is frozen, and the button enables it again).kre--- main.tcl	Wed Aug 21 15:01:48 2002

"Hey there,If you're like me, you've tried EVERYTHING to lose
weight.  I know how you feel - the special diets,
miracle pills, and fancy exercise equipment never helped
me lose a pound either.  It seemed like the harder I tried,
the bigger I got, until I heard about a product called
Extreme Power Plus.You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister swore it helped her lose 23 pounds in just two weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a shot.  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made. Period.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and got permission to resell it - at a BIG discount.  I want
to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I give you my personal pledge that Extreme Power Plus
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU.  If it doesn't, you can return it
any time for a full refund.    If you are frustrated with trying other products, not having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - EXTREME
POWER PLUS.You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS, RESULTS, 
RESULTS!! Here is the bottom line ...I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.  
Just try it for one month - there's nothing to lose, and everything 
to gain.  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.  That is my
pledge to you.  To order Extreme Power Plus on our secure server, just click

"Hi,I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a
base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base
image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes
changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance
incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the
current disk image for that specific virtual machine.This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the
honeypots mailing list)
http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.htmlCould this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server
applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,
even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are
layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server
running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net
business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one
of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database
server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one
partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the
partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from
one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap
space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that
shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or
Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But
what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or
""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the
redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be
minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from
backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high
availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is
always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at
the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater
performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be
applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions
(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept
been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?
I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in
this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server
systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and
non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly
ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or
no) downtime.Thanks for any opinions,
Ben

                While tablet PCs offer cool features, like letting you scribble notes on the screen and swivel the display, David's not sure they're right for everyone. Why? For starters, they're expensive and impractical for traveling.

"( otcbb : itst ) up 38 % , uregent news alert urgent news alert stock profile press release international telephone services ( its ) is a telecommunications company born in 1995 and whose objective was to bring the most advanced technology in communications within the reach of its clients . its started off offering a call - back service to a wide portfolio of foreigners on the costa del sol ( south of spain ) , then extending this to businesses also based in the area . as of december 1998 , when full liberalisation occurred in the telecommunications market in spain , its focused its efforts on providing a made - to - measure service to each client at the best price and with a high level of quality . the company at this point offered primarily long distance national and international calls , prepaid calling cards , and intelligent numbers ( 90 x , 800 - type ) . with the boom in the telecoms markets up to mid 2000 , its began to quote on the otcbb and began expanding its presence to other prime tourist locations in spain . unfortunately , the initiative did not have enough time to get traction before the dot . com bubble burst and with it dragged investor confidence in the rest of the telecommunications sector . by the end of 2001 , its downsized its operations and refocused its efforts on the south of spain in order to "" ride out the storm . "" by january 2002 , actual shareholders , not happy with the financial or business results produced by the management at the time , and in the absence of a clear strategy to bring its back to the forefront of the competitive telecoms market in spain , decided to change the management team in order to bring in fresh ideas and an executive team capable of relaunching its as a serious contender and thereby increasing company value . as of the end of march , its ' new ceo joined the company bringing with him a wealth of experience in the telecoms sector both in spain and north america . since this time , the new ceo has put in place a new executive team consisting of a new cfo and coo as well as director of sales . these key positions have been filled with seasoned veterans from the telecoms and consulting areas which amongst these for bring over 80 years related work experience to the project . in addition , the focus of the company is being changed from being a regionally focused reseller of services to an integrated telecommunications provider focused on the competitive packaging of services to specific market segments nationwide . some of these services will be resold and others will be developed by its , installed , maintained and supported by its , thus providing a differentiated advantage with respect to its traditional competitors . some of these services will be innovative services not yet offered in spain . another element to maximize the effectiveness of this new positioning is that the head office has been moved to madrid , spain ' s telecoms center . the new its is positioning is focused on ensuring that every dollar of capital employed has a satisfactory return from its shareholders . as such , its is : 1 ) building very little "" owned "" infrastructure for commodity services , utilizing and integrating the vast amount of underutilized infrastructure of other existing operators . 2 ) investing in technologically innovative infrastructures and services . 3 ) investing in optimising its commercial dimensions . the company has an excellent list of blue chip distribution partners , such as : corte ingles , respol ( petrol stations ) and carrefour ( 220 stores ) . the cards are distributed at over 2000 outlets in spain , including 1 , 000 post offices . the company has pending contracts with a u . s . military base in spain , 15 adventure and marine parks , and a large chain of convenience stores throughout spain . management team gustavo g ?

"" i waited patiently . i knew boys like to play . they ' d come to me in their own time . on day two , the oldest two were doing summersaults over my lap . the youngest , ben , took a little longer , but yesterday he raced me across the yard thirty times and won every time . the weekend brought back memories of my own childhood . we had such imaginations . in our minds , a tree was a tower to spot approaching bad guys , a big rock became a mountain , a fallen log a space ship headed to the stars . we had toys , but we had to use our imagination , not like the new toys i see my grandkids with . our toys didn ' t talk , and if they did , you pulled a string to make it work . we had blocks to build , crayons to create , trucks and cars to push . they were simple toys that required imagination . i thought about the toys in my garage , the ones i saved , when my children outgrew them . they were simple and needed their imagination to work . mr . potato head allowed them to learn parts of the body and giggle at the funny face with an ear where its mouth should have been . i still have an old plastic phone . it has a dial to turn , a bell that rings when you push a button , and that ' s it . it doesn ' t talk , squawk , beep or move around the room . it ' s simple and was used when they played house , nurse , doctor , and secretary . i have a toy doctor ' s bag , with all the plastic doctor ' s tools . i remember all the broken bones , cuts , bangs , scratches and aches my daughter repaired as i lay in her office moaning . most toys today do it all . we don ' t need imagination - - it comes in a box . video games that take us into another world or reality , talking toys , with vocabularies better than most people , computerized toys to teach the alphabet . kids sit and have imagination brought to them . the teaching toys are great , but children tire of them - - it ' s like being in school . when my son was young and tired of his toys , he would come to me and say , "" dad , i ' m bored . "" "" go find something to do , "" i ' d reply . "" i don ' t know what to do . "" "" go outside and find a friend . "" "" naaa ! i don ' t want to do that . "" "" use your imagination . "" "" huh ? "" he asked . "" well , when i was young . . . "" you know the routine . sports is the same . we ' re entertained for hours watching someone else have fun doing what they ' re good at . wouldn ' t it be better to be playing yourself ? if we don ' t like the sports available to watch , we create new ones . it doesn ' t matter what , people will pay to see it , because they need to be entertained . i haven ' t heard of world championship worm digging , but if someone offered a large cash price , people would buy tickets to scream at the contestants . i worry . are we becoming a society that needs outside influence to have fun ? i think i ' ll go climb a tree . maybe there ' s a pirate ship on the horizon or someone is attacking my castle . just imagine . - - michael t . smith michael lives in new jersey with his new wife and son . from our mailbag : ( in response to last week ' s story , cinderella men ) dear heartwarmers : last week ' s heartwarming story opened a door to memory lane . i too , was born in the 30 s and felt some of the poverty of that time . i remember my mom and dad who never complained of the fatigue that was so ever present in their lives . we were very fortunate in as much as we always had plenty of food and warm shelter . we had a garden and salvaged every edible product available - - even certain "" weeds "" that were quite tasty after mother got all the spices in them . i had several beautiful dresses made from feed sacks that i wore with pride ! we were very poor , but so rich indeed because we had love and the knowledge that god was upper most in our lives , and it taught us lessons that had never been printed in the books . i deeply appreciate those lessons of long ago because they have taught me how to handle the tough times we have encountered in this life of prosperity and promise . thank you again for your lovely story . god bless . - - do you enjoy heartwarmers ?

"Hi all.
Does anyone know how to set up dual keyboards(one is actually a stand-alone
keypad)?
Both keyboards have PS/2 connections and I want the keypad to be plugged in
as the primary input device.  Then if the other keyboard is plugged in, that
should take over.
Possible?  Any possible hacks?

"do they get it ? new york , nov 12 ( reuters ) - online energy trading leader enrononline will merge with smaller rival dynegydirect after its parent company enron corp . ( nyse : ene - news ) agreed last week to a $ 9 billion takeover by dynegy inc . ( nyse : dyn - news ) , dynegy said monday . the integration of the two platforms will take about six to nine months , dynegy said . in the meantime , the two will continue to operate separately . ` ` we ' re looking to take the best of both platforms for the integrated company , ' ' said dynegy spokesman john sousa . ` ` ( the emerging platform ) will continue to be based on a one - to - many philosophy as it stands now .

"four new graphs we have created four additional graphs to be published daily along with the dpr : return on var ( rovar ) curve shift p & l ( delta - gamma ) sharpe ratio risk - return ( large ) risk - return ( small ) all of these graphs deal with the concept of risk - adjusted return . the markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics . furthermore , enron ' s appetite for risk also differs in each market . as a result , it is difficult to compare returns in absolute terms . therefore , the approach of these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk , in effect restating return numbers into a standard base ( how many dollars we earn for every dollar we put at risk ) . for each business unit or commodity group , the rovar graph shows an average of daily total p it shows an average of daily curve shift p & l ( both delta and gamma ) divided by its standard deviation . this sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by non - trading p & l ( like new deals , reserves , and so forth ) . furthermore , whereas var is a forward looking statistic ( the most we are likely to lose in one day with a given probability ) , standard deviation is backward looking ( the actual volatility of our returns over the period ) . this graph also has two bars for every business unit or commodity group : a dark brown on the left showing the sharpe ratio on a 4 week rolling basis , and a light brown on the right showing the ratio on a 1 week basis . the curve shift p & l sharpe ratio and the rovar graphs complement each other well . they measure different things , but if our p & l is composed mostly of curve shift , and if our var closely predicts curve shift volatility , the two statistics should be very close . sometimes it is interesting to see the actual magnitude of the p & l relative to the risk . we therefore put together the risk - return graphs . on the vertical axis , they show 4 week rolling average p & l . on the horizontal , they show 4 week rolling average var . the various business units are plotted as points on the graphs . these graphs are closely related to the 4 - week rovars , in that the vertical value of every point divided by its horizontal value is the business unit ' s rovar ( average p & l / average var ) . another way of looking at these graphs is that the slope of a line connecting the origin ( 0 , 0 ) with the plotted point of a business unit is its rovar . books with small risks and returns ( < $ 2 million ) are plotted on the "" small "" graph , and the rest , on the "" large "" . these graphs are based on the dpr database that we built to standardize and capture the information that is reported in the dpr . most , but not all of the information in the dpr currently flows from the database . as a result , we do not have rovars or sharpe ratios for every business unit . as we continue to set up exports into the database , we will fill in the missing numbers . we will e - mail you these graphs every day until we can publish them on the intra - net . please remember to launch the file in excel , instead of using the lotus notes viewer . the var limit usage graphs that we created last week are already on the web . we hope that you find all of these useful . regards , eugenio perez",Safe Email

"re : 5 . 1484 comparative syntax since chet creider 's posting of 8 dec rightly corrected some misinformation i gave in my off-the - top-of - the-head posting about karamojong , i decided to make amends by doing a little research ( very little ) to check the rest of what i said . consider it a xmas gift . below is the relevant section of recent nilo - saharan classification ( sudanic : nilotic ) . it 's basically the same as greenberg ( 1963 ) with some refinements in further branching but no rearrangement of limbs . east sudanic has four branches , including eastern and western , then nilotic with three branches , including west , east and south . karamojong belongs to the east branch of the nilotic branch of east sudanic . it is therefore classified as closer to maasai ( maa - lotuko branch ) and bari ( bari branch ) than to the lwo branch of the west branch of nilotic , but no closer to kalenjin , a group in the south branch ( e . g . , nandi ) than to the west branch . the following is a relatively recent classification , such as found in schadeberg 's ( 1981 ) article on nilo - saharanisch . central sudanic : moru - madi - lugbara etc east sudanic : eastern : nubian western : tama , daju kuliak : ik , so nilotic : west : ( some call it north nilotic ) burun : idem nuer - dinka : idem lwoo : north : shilluk , anwak south : achooli , luo east : ( some call it central nilotic ) bari : bari , kakwa etc maa - lotuko : maasai etc teso - turkana : karamojong , jie etc south : kalenjin : nandi - markweta : nandi , tuken elgon : sapiny , pok okiek / dorobo : sogoo etc datoga : etc beside the bewildering array of east and west branches of branches down the sudanic line i can trace my inaccuracy to conolly 's mention of jie . as a language , jie , along with karamojong and various other languages such as teso , are part of the teso - turkana branch of east nilotic . however , in an earlier classification , e . g . , crazzolara ( 1938 ) , jii is the name used for west nilotic ( or at least the current lwo and nuer - dinka branches ) . jii means "" people "" ( or "" ordinary people "" ) in most of the west nilotic languages , hence the classificational name . the dinka call themselves "" jieng ' "" . i suspect that the east nilotic jie ( also spelled "" jiye "" ) is the same word , but i have n't checked if the jie actually call themselves that . african language nomenclature is full of terms not used by the speakers themselves ( but often by sarcastic neighbors , so that , for example , while the dinka evidently see no stigma in their autonym , the achooli use the term somewhat like english uses the term "" the masses "" , cf . hoi polloi ) . just for fun let 's see how accurate what i said was about the numbers from one to ten are . we do n't need six through nine , because they are compounds of five plus numbers under five . the data for most languages are restricted to what i happened to have within reach without doing library research . however , the data for bari and teso ( ateso , in my experience ) are from transcriptions of recordings i made a long time ago in east africa before i even knew how these languages were classified . i do n't have published linguistic data on hand for them . in all cases i have simplified orthography for typographical ease ( losing information ) . for example , the "" h "" following a vowel refers to the retracted ( lax - sounding ) tongue root position of that vowel . the nilotic languages have complex vowel systems with "" tense "" and "" lax "" subsystems . of course , lexical numbers by themselves do not prove anything about genetic af finities . nevertheless , some interesting patterns emerge to compare with the currently accepted classification scheme . west nilotic : achooli anwak luo dinka nuer 1 ace : hl achyehloh achiel tok kehl 2 aryo : h areahu ariyo rou rahu 3 adeek adahgoh adehk diak dyohk 4 ang ' we : hn ang ' wehnoh ang ' wen ng ' wan ng ' wan 5 abiic abiyuh abihch dhiec dye : ch 10 apaar apar apar thiaar wahl the first consonant in ' 5 ' seems to be diagnostic of the distinctness of nuer - dinka from the lwoo group . otherwise , dinka ' 1 ' is wierd , and so is the first consonant of dinka ' 10 ' ( cf . dinka - nuer ' 5 ' ) , but not much wierder than a comparison of indo - european numbers ( cf . germanic ' 4 - 5 ' or slavic ' 9-10 ' ) . reconstruction is not difficult , although you do n't have an accurate transcription of the vowel distinctions ( or tone ) . east and south ( nandi ) nilotic : ( afro - asiatic : cushitic ) bari teso maasai nandi somali 1 kyeling ' diopeti - bo akenge kow ( southern also ' hal ' ) 2 morehk iyere - re aeng lamma 3 msala : iu ~ li - uni somok siddah 4 ingwan iwong ' wahn - ong ' uan angwan afar 5 mukanad ikany imiet mut shan 10 pwahk itomony tomon taman tommon the numbers ' 2 ' and ' 4 ' are consistent with west nilotic . otherwise , lexicon appears to be areally defined . first maasai and nandi seem to have a cognate for west nilotic ' 5 ' . however , maasai is classified with bari and teso as east nilotic . thus , bari and teso seem to share an innovation for ' 5 ' which does not extend to maasai or south nilotic . meanwhile the cognacy of bari ' 3 ' with teso and maasai is questionable , and nandi ' 3 ' is beyond the pale . interestingly , my data for bari has ' 10 ' as given , while greenberg gives bari ' 10 ' as "" mere "" in one of his mass cognate sets ( p . 106 ) . "" pwahk "" fits in with the west nilotic set , but presumably g 's data comes from a published source . ( i have n't loo ked at my data since i transcribed it - - several decades , but i relistened to my bari tape to make sure i had n't transposed the word for ' 10 ' with some other word like ' toothbrush ' . ) by the way , teso is closely related to karamojong so i would expect the numbers to be similar , including the cushitic loan for ' 10 ' , but with doubts about whether karamojong ' 5 ' would follow the maasai or bari - teso pattern . ( gotta go to the library for this one . any volunteers ? ) the word for ' 10 ' in the other east and south nilotic languages was recognised by g as a loan from somali or one of the mutually intelligible galla languages of cushitic . that 's why i gave the somali numbers above . easy to see it would be a lot more difficult to argue for somali as nilotic than for the other languages [ uhm , if their other lexical correspondences behave like their numbers - - which they do . . . g actually uses the example of cushitic multiple of ten in maasai in his arguments against meinhof 's nilo - hamitic hypothesis . cushitic was part of "" hamitic "" in the older terminology ( "" afro - asiatic "" is g 's coinage for older "" semito - hamitic "" ) . . note nubian ' 10 ' below . . thus , g has been as sharp to use arguments about borrowing against his opponents as have his opponents against him . what to do ? east sudanic central sudanic nubian lugbara 1 we : rum aluh 2 awum iri 3 toskum na 4 kemsum su 5 dijum towi 10 dimnum muhdri wow ! numbers do n't help unite nubian as a branch of east sudanic with nilotic . obviously other criteria were used . for superifical impression nubian ' 10 ' looks promising as cognate with south and most of east nilotic , and maybe it is , but that card has already been played non-genetically above - - and with good reason . . g , p106 again , compares bari ' 10 ' "" mere "" with khordofan nubian "" bure "" for the same ) . as central sudanic , lugbara might be expected by the naive to be even more different from nilotic than nubian , but the numbers do n't show that . g uses lugbara ' 2 ' in his mass cognate sets for the unity of central and east sudanic . interestingly , he also uses dinka ' 1 ' , the wierd one for west nilotic , in the same mass cognate sets - - for comparison with ' 10 ' in some central sudanic groups . lots of interesting claims there , e . g . , the most common west nilotic word for "" one "" is not proto - west nilotic , let alone proto - nilotic ( despite the suggestiveness of bari and nandi ' 1 ' above ) . g could be right , for all i know . anyway , i ' m just as interested in the areal cross-currents as in the hypotheses about genetic relationships . thus , other implications emerge from g 's mass comparison s , e . g . , the pan - nilotic word for ' 4 ' must be an areal innovation ( maybe in proto - nilotic ) since it does not occur elsewhere in nilo - saharan , or in any other known language group for that matter . so , ok . we have some pretty strong hypotheses . i have n't followed nilo - saharan studies closely , though nubian , but the numbers do n't show that . g uses lugbara ' 2 ' in his mass cognate sets for the unity of central and east sudanic . interestingly , he also uses dinka ' 1 ' , the wierd one for west nilotic , in the same mass cognate sets - - for comparison with ' 10 ' in some central sudanic groups . lots of interesting claims there , e . g . , the most common west nilotic word for "" one "" is not proto - west nilotic , let alone proto - nilotic ( despite the suggestiveness of bari and nandi ' 1 ' above ) . g could be right , for all i know . anyway , i ' m just as interested in the areal cross-currents as in the hypothese about genetic relationships . thus , other implications emerge from g 's mass comparisons , e . g . , the pan - nilotic word for ' 4 ' must be an areal innovation ( maybe in proto - nilotic ) since it does not occur elsewhere in nilo - saharan , or in any other known language group for that matter . so , ok . we have some pretty strong hypotheses . i have n't followed nilo - sahara n studies closely , though west african niger - congo ( actually the benue - kwa grou p of niger - congo ) . greenberg ( 1963 ) notes that westermann also used the label for various east sudanic languages ( w had done some fieldwork on nilotic ) , beli eving that they were related to the west african niger - congo ( i . e .

settings (and metacity has it's settings handled by gconf, like
all good gnome2 apps). It's true there's no designated metacity
configurator - but the whole point of metacity is to have
reasonable defaults, and thus get away from the need for settings
altogether, and have the window manager be not in the way (as so
many are).As to the sawfish issue, no idea, sorry - are you sure that
gnome2's panel handles 1.4 applets at all?Cheers,

"thestreet . com : trade winds blowing enron further south trade winds blowing enron further south by peter eavis senior columnist 08 / 30 / 2001 02 : 45 pm edt url : enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) appears to be relying on asset sales to offset weakness in its high - profile energy trading operation . a billion - dollar sale of power plants likely made a hefty contribution to the energy giant ' s second - quarter profits , which are supposed to owe their rapid growth to the company ' s well - publicized trading acumen . a smaller sale of impaired assets to an affiliate company also may have helped nudge second - quarter numbers past wall street earnings estimates . one energy market source alleges the price tag on this deal was inflated . complicating matters , enron ' s financials make it difficult to determine exactly how much these deals may have contributed to earnings . for its part , enron flatly denies that it used one - time gains to meet estimates or that the price of the impaired - assets sale was inflated . but dependence on asset sales would mark a big step backwards for houston - based enron , which has long told investors that trading is its future . by shrewdly capturing a dominant position in the nation ' s fast - growing energy market , enron has expanded trading profits exponentially over the last couple of years . operating earnings from trading surged 160 % in 2000 to $ 1 . 6 billion , causing the stock to double . now there ' s chatter that enron ' s swashbuckling traders were caught out by the second quarter ' s unexpected drop in the prices of power and other energy commodities . in addition , the company booked a large loss in its broadband unit . if asset sales can ' t be repeated and trading income weakens , earnings could crater , observers say , which could pull enron ' s already battered stock down even lower . in fact , fear that enron ' s prodigious profits growth won ' t be sustained is the chief reason its stock price has dropped by half this year . other factors have contributed as well : investor dissatisfaction over enron ' s opaque and confusing financial statements have risen throughout the year , and earlier this month ceo jeff skilling quit after only six months on the job . skilling ' s departure sparked all sorts of dark theories about the real reason for his sudden move . enron chairman ken lay , who has now reassumed the ceo post , said this week that he aims to improve enron ' s disclosure . he has moved to allay concerns over top - level instability by promoting two experienced enron executives to the positions of president , also vacated by skilling , and vice chairman . but skeptics remain unconvinced . "" i think the second - quarter performance was bad in the trading operations and was covered up by asset sales , "" says mark roberts , director of research at off wall street , a cambridge , mass . - based stock analysis firm that doesn ' t do underwriting . ( off wall street issued a critical report on enron in may . ) for the quarter , enron made 45 cents a share , 3 cents more than analysts had expected . details , details one transaction investors want details on is the sale by enron north america of three gas - fired power plants to allegheny energy supply , a unit of allegheny energy ( aye : nyse - news - commentary ) , hagerstown , md . the deal took place in may for a price of $ 1 . 05 billion , according to allegheny ' s recent securities and exchange commission disclosures . ( allegheny declined to comment on the deal . ) enron ' s second - quarter earnings got a huge boost from the sale of these three so - called peaker plants , says roberts . he believes the gain on the sale may have been as high as $ 500 million . an energy company analyst at a wall street brokerage thinks it may have been closer to $ 300 million . ( his firm hasn ' t done recent underwriting for enron . ) enron ' s financial statements don ' t specify the size of the gain from the peakers , so called because they supply power when demand is strong . the company declines to offer a number , saying the gain figure is hard to isolate because it must be netted against gains or losses on contracts associated with the assets sold . however , enron ' s public disclosure states that proceeds from the sale are included in its commodity sales - and - services line , which is by far the biggest contributor to enron ' s earnings , producing $ 762 million in operating profits in the second quarter . the problem is that the firm ' s trading profits also are booked in this segment . as a result , investors can ' t know how much of the quarter ' s blowout commodity sales - and - services earnings came from the peaker sale and how much from straight trading . if roberts ' $ 500 million estimate is correct , trading may have accounted for only $ 262 million in second - quarter operating profit . partners indeed the other deal that ' s raising eyebrows is the sale in june by enron of texas - based assets that are used to produce mtbe ( methyl tertiary - butyl ether ) , the chemical compound added to gasoline to make it burn more efficiently . the assets were sold for $ 120 million by one subsidiary of enron to another subsidiary , called eott energy partners ( eot : nyse - news - commentary ) , chiefly a marketer and transporter of crude oil . any gain on the sale would have been booked in enron ' s wholesale line . the issues with the deal are plenty . it took place on june 30 , right at the end of the second quarter . this could be construed as a sign that enron pressed eott to do the deal then so it could include any gain in second - quarter results . then there ' s the question of price . enron took a $ 440 million impairment charge against these mtbe assets at the end of 1999 , responding to what it described at the time as "" significant changes in state and federal rules regarding the use of mtbe . "" some environmental authorities believe mtbe to be a dangerous substance and claim the mtbe content in drinking water has reached unacceptably high levels . skeptics ask : how can enron turn around 18 months after a massive impairment charge and sell the assets for $ 120 million ? in addition , an executive at another energy company that talked to enron about buying the mtbe assets claims they ' re worth $ 50 million at most ; he claims enron has long been trying to sell them for around $ 150 million . put bluntly , did enron stuff eott with overpriced assets to meet earnings expectations ? an enron spokeswoman responds : "" eott views buying these assets as an expansion from its core business . it makes good business sense . "" and a recent eott sec disclosure states that eott ' s audit committee , made up of three directors who aren ' t employees or officers of any enron affiliate , as well as an investment bank , judged the sale price to be fair . however , the chairman of the audit committee , daniel whitty , is a director for two other enron subsidiaries . he declined to comment on the deal . a person familiar with enron ' s business adds that it was eott that wanted to get the deal done before the end of the second quarter so it could include the assets in third - quarter numbers . this person also says the gain was "" immaterial "" to enron ' s second - quarter numbers , since there wasn ' t a big difference between the fair value the assets were marked down to and the price at which they were sold . most important , this person insists , the $ 120 million price isn ' t based only on the assets sold . eott is also paying for a contract with enron that gives eott 10 years ' worth of mtbe - related business . what ' s more , enron has agreed to retain the price risk associated with the commodities involved in mtbe production , this person states . whatever the case with the mtbe assets , enron would go a long way toward fulfilling lay ' s promises of glasnost by breaking out asset - sale gains . "" they need to put their disclosure where their mouth is , "" concludes off wall street ' s roberts . know any companies that the market may be misvaluing ? detox would like to hear about them . please send all feedback to peavis @ thestreet . com . in keeping with tsc ' s editorial policy , peter eavis doesn ' t own or short individual stocks . he also doesn ' t invest in hedge funds or other private investment partnerships .",Safe Email

I occasionally buy X-10 stuff.  I've learned from past experiences to 
create a quick mail alias to get order confs and what not.  Then can 
it once the order is complete because those spamming SOBs will not 
stop filling my inbox with 3-6 ads per day.  I've LARTed them and 
their upstream numerous times asking to be list washed.  I don't even 
get an auto-ack.  I started a procmail recipe to reject mail to them 
and include a form letter (I was planning on later appending every 
piece of x-10 spam I've archived to the form letter for their reading 
pleasure...) but I haven't gotten it to work.  Bottom line, if I gave 
them permission to mail me (explicitly or via privacy policy), it's 
not spam but once I told them to stop mailing me then it's spam.My $.02

"language as metaphor & metaphors for language - - session at aaa 98 i have volunteered to organize the following session for the next meeting of the society for linguistic anthropology at aaa 98 ( next winter in washington ) : language as metaphor and metaphors for language metaphor has been shown to be an integral component of the way we conceptualize experience and embody it in language . but metaphor can also be thought of as a specific tool that can be used in a variety of disciplines : a concrete image can summarize or illuminate the object of study , and sometimes even inform the direction of the discipline . new theories give rise to new metaphors , and the study of such metaphors can throw light on the development of theories . papers are invited from both linguists and non-linguists on two topics : 1 ) language used as metaphor : for a restricted communicative code used concurrently with language : e . g . the language of flowers ; but also for various characteristics of expressive or cognitive domains , e . g . the grammar / syntax / vocabulary of architecture , music , etc . ; what characteristics of language are used metaphorically ? to what do they correspond in other domains ? what is the usefulness of language metaphors for the domains in question ? 2 ) language as object of metaphor : what can language be compared to ? explicit ( e . g . neo-grammarian ' family tree ' ; saussure 's game of chess ; the city ) and implicit ( ? ) metaphors for language ; what do such metaphors reveal about language and how speakers view it ? how do metaphors for language relate to directions in linguistics ? please contact me : marie - lucie tarpent , mount st vincent u , halifax , n . s . b3m 2j6 canada ; 902-457 - 6172 ; marie-lucie . tarpent @ msvu . ca .",Safe Email

Not true on the choice part.After three weeks of me telling eircom that I did not in fact need nor want
their ?1800 worth of router and firewall
nor their onsite survey... for the uncapped service I actually managed to
get a 4 port modem (after asking for a 1 port modem) instead of ye olde
hardware router & firewall and eircom onsite.I would have argued for the 1 port modem... (which I had asked for), but a
Director wanted the DSL up ... and fast....Still it only took me three weeks to get (almost) what I

( bib ) this is an urgent and very confidential business proposition . i am writing to seek your cooperation over this business deal . in my department , i discovered an abandoned sum of us $ 12 , 300 , 000 . 00 , ( twelve million , three hundred thousand dollars ) only , in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in a plane crash that took place in kenya , east africa , the late dr . george brumley , a citizen of atlanta , united states of america but resident in burkina faso , west africa and a physician . since we got information about his death , we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because it cannot be released unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately , all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim . it is therefore upon this discovery that i now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you via your foreign bank account as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and this money could go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill . the banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after four years , the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund . the request for your assistance and maximum co - operation as a foreign citizen to stand as the next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner . 40 % of this money will be for you as my foreign partner , in respect to the provision of a foreign account . 10 % will be set aside for the expenses that may be incurred during the business and 50 % would be for me . there after i will come over to your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated . therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged , you must apply first to the bank as the relation or next of kin to the deceased , indicating your claims and where the money will be remitted . upon receipt of your reply , i will send to you by fax or email the text of application which you will fill and submit to the office of the foreign remittance director of the banque international du burkina . i will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is strictly confidential and i will use my position in this bank to effect a hitch free transfer of the fund . please , visit the website below for more information about the plane crash and the tragic death of the deceased and his entire family , late dr . george brumley . awaiting your urgent reply thanks and my regards . mrs clemence offia . n / b . please reply through my alternative email address indicated below ; offiafamily @ yahoo . com",Phishing Email

even be partitioned into manageable steps. All this can also be done
without selling exclusive rights to your wallet to the World's
Second-Richest Corporation (assuming Cisco is still #1) and vendor
