Date: Not suppliedAll through October, Berkeley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute is 
hosting Cinemath, a mathematics film festival:     Permutations and Configurations: A Calculated Cinema     In this avant-garde subset of Cinemath, we explore films that have been 
    constructed using mathematical concepts both simple and complex- geometric 
    permutations, musical frameworks, even topography are among the strategies 
    that have been employed to compose and sequence film frames. Filmmakers 
    such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest 
    avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming 
    abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce 
    dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics 
    are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances 
    such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the 
    viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of 
    machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James 
    and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary 
    animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry 
    Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish 
    Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, 
    while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously 
    calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton, 
    and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to 
    graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no 
    mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to 
    try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Jef[3]!_)[1] http://www.msri.org/20thanniversary/cinemath.html

"muc - 7 call for participation * * * call for participation * * * seventh message understanding system evaluation and message understanding conference ( muc - 7 ) evaluation : 2 - 6 march 1998 conference : april 1998 washington , d . c . area sponsored by : the human language systems tipster text program of the defense advanced research projects agency information technology office ( darpa / ito ) the message understanding conferences have provided on ongoing forum for assessing the state of the art and practice in text analysis technology and for exchanging information on innovative computational techniques in the context of fully implemented systems that perform realistic tasks . the evaluations have provided researchers and potential sponsors and customers with a quantitative means to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of the technologies , and the results reported on at the conferences have sparked customer interest in the potential utility of the technologies . the seventh message understanding conference ( muc - 7 ) will provide an opportunity for both new and experienced muc participants to participate in a flexible evaluation , suited to development needs and abilities . it will provide : * opportunity to select among a variety of tasks : named entity ( ne ) , coreference ( co ) , template element ( te ) , template relationship ( tr ) and scenario template ( st ) . * two tasks for evaluating component technologies ( ne and co ) , which use standard generalized markup language ( sgml ) as output format * redesigned information extraction ( ie ) task , with two domain-independent subtasks ( te and tr ) separated from domain-dependent subtask ( st ) . * emphases of st task on portability and on minimizing human resources required to participate in the evaluation . * three experimental tracks to explore new data sets and tasks . participation in muc - 7 is actively sought from both new and veteran organizations . with the new and redesigned evaluation tasks , muc - 7 offers a good opportunity for organizations to try out new ideas for handling nlp problems that are of both scientific and practical interest without having to participate in the entire range of tasks . the conference itself will consist primarily of presentations and discussions of innovative techniques , system design , and test results . there will also be an opportunity for participants to demo their evaluation systems . attendance at the conference is limited to evaluation participants and to guests invited by the darpa tipster text program . a conference proceedings , including test results , will be published . schedule : 1 july 97 : application deadline for participation 15 july 97 : release of ne , co , te , tr , and example st training data and scorer 8 september 97 : release of dry run st task definition , training data , and scorer 29 sept - 3 oct 97 : muc - 7 dry run ( all participants ) 6 february 98 : release of formal test st task definition , training data , and scorer 2 - 6 march 98 : muc - 7 formal run 7 - 9 april 98 : 7th message understanding conference ( tentative dates ) data and task description : the texts to be used for system development and testing are news service articles from the new york times news service , supplied by the linguistic data consortium ( ldc ) [ ldc @ ldc . upenn . edu ] . training , dry run , and test data for all the tasks are extracted from a corpus of approximately 158 , 000 articles . sets of articles to be used in the muc - 7 evaluation will be distributed via ftp upon payment of a one time fee of $ 100 and upon signing of a user agreement for the use of these texts . the user agreement can be retrieved from the ldc catalog ( evaluation agreements ) . the url for the ldc home page is : http : / / www . ldc . upenn . edu . five separate evaluations will be conducted as part of muc - 7 . the definition of these evaluations has been worked out since late 1996 by members of the muc - 7 planning committee . the evaluations may be viewed as capturing the results of text analysis at various levels of aggregation of information : * named entity ( ne ) requires only that the system under evaluation identify each bit of pertinent information in isolation from all others . * coreference ( co ) requires connecting all references to "" identical "" entities . * template element ( te ) requires grouping entity attributes together into entity "" objects . "" * template relationship ( tr ) requires identifying relationships between template elements . * scenario template ( st ) requires identifying instances of a task-specific event and identifying event attributes , including entities that fill some role in the event ; the overall information content is captured via interlinked "" objects . "" * experimental tracks using new data sets are variants of the ne task . the task definition is the same as for the basic ne task , but the texts are different . * experimental track involving a new task is a simplified version of the te task . key things to note about each evaluation task : * ne covers named organizations , people , and locations , along with date / time expressions and monetary and percentage expressions ; it requires production of sgml tags as output . * co covers noun phrases ( common and proper ) and personal pronouns that are "" identical "" in their reference ; it requires production of sgml tags as output ; the tags for coreferring strings form "" equivalance "" classes , which are used for scoring . * te covers organizations , persons , and artifacts , which are captured in the form of template "" objects "" consisting of a predefined set of attributes . * tr covers relationships among template elements , including location and time relationships , which are captured in the form of template "" relations "" consisting of a relationship and the template elements participating in that relationship . tr is a new task for muc - 7 . * st covers a particular scenario , which is kept secret until one month prior to testing in order to focus on system portability ; however , the generalized structure of a scenario template is predefined , and example scenarios are available for participants to examine . this task is domain dependent . * tasks for the experimental tracks are derived from ne and te . there is a world wide web site that allows automated testing following the rules of muc - 6 . it will be of particular value to new participants . the website is password protected and you need to be licensed to access the acl / dci disk from the ldc to obtain a password from chinchor @ gso . saic . com . muc - 6 articles were taken from the acl / dci disk . an anonymous ftp site will be available for downloading muc - 7 related material . this cfp and the muc - 7 participant agreement are available to the public from the ftp site . each participant ( after signing the ldc user agreement and a muc - 7 participation agreement ) will receive a password to download the muc - 7 data , definitions , and scoring software at the release times noted above . the url of the website is http : / / muc . saic . com . the ftp site is ftp . muc . saic . com . test protocol and evaluation criteria : muc - 7 participants may elect to do one or any combination of tasks and experimental tracks . participants will have access to shared resources such as the training texts and annotations / templates , task documentation , and scoring software . all muc - 7 participants are encouraged to participate in the dry run and take advantage of material available . the formal test will be conducted during the first week in march . it will be carried out by the participants at their own sites in accordance with a prepared test procedure and the results submitted to the ftp site for official scoring with the software prepared by saic for muc - 7 . test sets used for the evaluations will consist of 100 texts , with subsets for some of the tasks . there will be different data sets for the dry run and the formal test . systems will be evaluated using recall and precision metrics ( all tasks ) , f - measure ( all tasks ) , and error-based metrics ( all tasks except co ) . the computation of these metrics is based on the scoring categories of correct , partial , incorrect , spurious , missing , and noncommittal . muc - 7 participants will be able to familiarize themselves with the evaluation criteria through usage of the evaluation software , which will be released along with the training data . instructions for responding to the call for participation : organizations within and outside the u . s . are invited to respond to this call for participation . by the time of the actual testing phase of the evaluation , systems must be able to accept texts without manual preprocessing , process them without human intervention , and output annotations ( ne , co ) or templates ( te , tr , st ) in the expected format . organizations should plan on allocating approximately two person-months of effort for participation in the evaluation and conference . it is understood that organizations will vary with respect to experience with sgml text annotation , information extraction , domain expertise / engineering , resources , contractual demands / expectations , etc . recognition of such factors will be made in any analyses of the results . organizations wishing to participate in the evaluation and conference must respond by july 1 , 1997 by submitting a short statement of interest via email and a signed copy of the muc - 7 participation agreement via surface mail . 1 . the statement of interest should be submitted via email to marsh @ aic . nrl . navy . mil and should include the following : a . evaluation task ( s ) ( choose one or more ) * named entity * coreference * template element * template relationship * scenario template b . primary point of contact . please include name , surface and email addresses , and phone and fax numbers . c . does your site have a copy of the muc -

"syntax / philosophy of lang cormack , annabel ; definitions : implications for syntax , semantics , and the language of thought ; 0-8153 - 3131 - 2 , cloth ; pages , $ 83 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics the answer to the question "" how can we understand and use a definition ? "" provides new constraints on natural language and on the internal language in which meaning is mentally represented . most syntax takes the sentence as the basic unit for well-formedness , but definitions force us to focus on words and phrases , and hence to focus on compositional syntax in parallel with compositional semantics . this study examines both dictionary definitions and definitions from textbooks from the points of view of their syntax , semantics , and use for learning word meaning . the tools used throughout are principles and parameters syntax , relevance theoretic pragmatics , model theoretic semantics , and the formal theory of definitions . the analyses argue that because phrases can be understood in isolation , some standard syntactic analyses must be modified . ' np movement ' has to be reanalysed as transmission of theta roles . these ideas are then applied to a variety of adjectives which take propositional complements . the final chapter argues that for definitions to be understood , the syntax of the language of thought must be close to that of natural language in specifiable ways . for example , semantic types must be common to the two languages . the book will be of interest to linguists concerned with syntax , semantics and pragmatics ; philosophers of mind and of language ; and lexicographers . e - mail : info @ garland . com",Safe Email

Read this email to the end, follow the instructions, and you won't have to worry about funding your retirement, having money to play, or making ends meet... EVER. I know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these before either. Then one day I realized that I throw away $25 going to a movie for 2 hours with my wife, why not try investing this same $25 in a system that just might work. I don't know why that day I decided to take a chance, but I can't even come close to imagining if I hadn't - I guess I'd still be poor.Read on. It's true. Every word of it. It's legal, and it's ethical. Not only are you making money from your own business, you're helping other people achieve their goals and fulfill their dreams. Give it a shot, you'll see there is absolutely no way you won't get AT LEAST a modest return on your start up capital. Okay - here's the scoop on CashByNet (CBN):==================================================Due to the popularity of this particular email business, and the business potential of the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program to see if it's legal, and if it really can make people money.Their findings proved that there are ""absolutely NO LAWS prohibiting the participation in the program, and if people can follow a few simple instructions they are bound to make amazing returns with only $25 in startup costs.""DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. THE MORE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE, THE BETTER OFF YOU BECOME, AND THE MORE INCOME YOU WILL MAKE.This is what one had to say:""I was approached many times before to participate in Cash By Net, but each time I passed on it. One day I decided that instead of going out that night, I would take the money I would have spent - invest it in this business, and see if it was as lucrative as everyone claimed. Two weeks went by . . . . nothing. Three weeks . . . . $50 dollars rolled in. At this point I was just relieved to get my money back. Then it happened - One week after this, I opened my mailbox to find $580 in $5 bills waiting for me. Its been about 8 months now, and I just bought a new Mercedes . . . black :) The startup costs are so small, and the time involved is less than 5 hours per week. Give it a shot - what do you have to lose?""Pam Hedland, South Bound Brook, New Jersey. ==================================================Another said:""Programs like this have been around for a long time but I never believed in them. But this year I won a $50 bet on the Patriots to win the Super Bowl. I got this email the following morning, and I felt like gambling. I spent $25 ordering the reports, and the other $25 paying a parking ticket. I followed the instructions meticulously - I thought I would at least get my original $25 back. As soon as I got the email out, not One week went by before I quadrupled my $25. I'd take that over the Patriots any day. I got excited, and that's when it started to explode. In less than 6 weeks I was already up $9500 bucks. It's been almost 4 months, and the flow hasn't stopped. On an average day, I get anwhere from $500 - $1500 in the mail. I always say that everything happens for a reason, and I feel that this was meant to be, maybe it is for you too.

Remember, this method has been tested, and proved and if you alter it, it will NOT work !!!This is a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time, and have something many people can't - a profitable business enterprise (and more money to do WHATEVER YOU COULD POSSIBLY WANT).For more information go to http://www.cashbynet.net================================================== HERE IS YOUR PERSONAL CBN MONEY LIST : ==================================================REPORT# 1: 'The Insider's Guide To Advertising for Free On The NetOrder Report #1 from:Chris King 905 HWY 321 NW PMB 131 Hickory, NC 28601 _______________________________________________________REPORT # 2: The Insider's Guide To Sending Bulk Email On The NetOrder Report # 2 from:Greg Ferris 264 S.

STEPS 1-6 =======================1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports from your CBN money list, take this original saved email and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.3..

This is critical to YOUR success.================================================== **** SAVE THE NEW MODIFIED EMAIL, AS THIS WILL BE THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENT WHICH YOU WILL SEND TO PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS. BE SURE TO HAVE YOUR NAME IN THE #1 POSITION AND THAT YOU DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES TO THIS DOCUMENT. THIS IS CRITICAL TO THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR BUSINESS AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE SIZE OF YOUR PROFITS.****As soon as you receive all 5 reports via email SAVE A COPY OF THEM! These are the products that your customers are paying for. Not only do these reports hold the secrets and instructions for your new venture, you will be redistributing them to customers when you receive payment. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports will provide you with valuable marketing information on how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more.There are 2 Primary methods you will use to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00REMEMBER, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more?THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE. VISIT CBN AT http://www.cashbynet.net/Calculator/ to plug in your own numbers and see the results. METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ==================================================Advertising on the net is extremely inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response than just emails alone. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you begin to become more knowledgeable about the business and study the 5 reports. Remember to always provide same day service on all orders to ensure proper return on the back end - this means quicker profits for you. $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.**ONCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report.You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! =================================================FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF CASH BY NET:Cash By Net has become a very popular business for many sole proprietors.

' s shares have fallen 26 percent in the past three days on concern the biggest energy trader ' s dealings with partnerships run by its chief financial officer contributed to investment losses . enron ' s stock dropped 10 percent today . enron ' s board cost the company at least $ 35 million by allowing chief financial officer andrew fastow to manage ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , partnerships that bought enron assets , a shareholder alleged wednesday in a lawsuit . the lawsuit came the day after enron reported $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses from failed investments . the wall street journal reported $ 35 million of the losses were connected with the two limited partnerships . enron also reduced shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from the partnerships , the paper reported yesterday . ` ` it looks sleazy , ' ' said roger hamilton , a manager at john hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 shares . ` ` if you are someone who invests in a company ' s management , it ' s almost time to punt with enron . ' ' enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t return calls or written requests seeking comment . fastow didn ' t immediately return a telephone call for comment . fastow and a handful of associates made more than $ 7 million last year in management fees and about $ 4 million in capital increases on an investment of about $ 3 million in one of the partnerships , the journal reported today . buying enron assets fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies and partnerships that appear to have ties to houston - based enron , based on filings with the texas secretary of state . the foreign business corporations and limited liability companies have directors , officers or managers whose address is listed as 1400 smith street in houston , enron ' s corporate address , according to texas records . fastow is listed as a director , officer or managing member in each one . at least one of the companies bought and sold enron assets , including foreign power plants . whitewing management , which lists fastow as its managing member , received $ 807 million from the sale of enron debt last year . under the terms of the debt sale , whitewing is allowed to use the proceeds to buy power plants from enron or make other ` ` permitted investments . ' ' whitewing has bought 14 enron plants or companies since 1999 and sold four . enron ' s denne has not responded to written requests about fastow ' s role at whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of the value of enron assets to benefit outside investors or company executives at enron ' s expense . shares of enron fell $ 2 . 95 to $ 26 . 05 . they have fallen 69 percent this year . - - russell hubbard in the princeton newsroom , 609 - 750 - 4651 or rhubbard 2 @ bloomberg . net , and jim kennett in houston , ( 713 ) 353 - 4871 or jkennett @ bloomberg . net / pjm / alp / pjm usa : update 1 - enron stock sustains further heavy losses . 10 / 19 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . ( new first paragraph , adds additional analyst comment ) by andrew kelly houston , oct 19 ( reuters ) - enron corp . stock sustained further heavy losses on friday as investor confidence in the former wall street favorite was rocked by reports about the company ' s relationship with a limited partnership that was run until recently by enron ' s chief financial officer . the energy giant ' s stock closed down $ 2 . 95 or 10 . 2 percent at $ 26 . 05 per share , making a cumulative loss of 27 percent for a week in which enron reported a third - quarter loss of $ 638 million , its first quarterly loss in over four years . analysts said confidence was shaken by several articles in the wall street journal this week alleging possible conflicts of interest on the part of chief financial officer andrew fastow , who until recently ran a limited partnership that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from enron . "" i don ' t think this thing passes the smell test , "" said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity . "" i think the cfo should be out of there right now . in the interest of the stockholders , that cfo should be gone , "" he said . enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements , but fastow severed his ties with the ljm 2 partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities . poor judgment ? analysts said that at the very least , the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at enron , which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of high - profile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer jeff skilling in august . "" for a company that had a lot of question marks around it already , these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors , "" said commerzbank securities analyst andre meade . "" it points to poor decision - making on behalf of the board and top management at enron , "" he said . enron , north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity , was one of wall street ' s high flyers last year , when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent . the stock ' s ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company ' s plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its enrononline internet energy trading platform . this year enron ' s shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadband and the internet soured , skilling resigned after only six months as ceo , and the company ' s dabhol power plant project in india became mired in a payments dispute . moody ' s investors service said earlier this week that it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after enron took $ 1 . 01 billion in write - downs and charges that substantially reduced valuations for several non - core businesses , including broadband and water services . some of enron ' s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings . analysts said enron ' s credibility has been severely damaged and the recent reports about the ljm 2 partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant surprises may lie ahead .

"" good people can always be placed . as long as there is a job to fill and the company has a budget to hire , "" sarah gilley of london - based recruitment group exchange consulting said . "" where the situation starts to get difficult is where everyone is cutting budgets , people are not being replaced when they leave and there have been an awful lot of redundancies . "" last week , scotiamocatta , a subsidiary of the bank of nova scotia and a key ring dealing member , unveiled its decision to give up open outcry trading on the lme floor , prompting around 25 job losses among traders , phone jockeys and clerks . then blue - blooded banker n . m . rothschild & sons closed its london and new york base metals units . it left its core precious metals business intact , but 20 base metals staff were laid off in the process . in the same week , the lme ' s largest floor trader , enron metals , said it planned to cut 10 to 20 percent of its metals staff as part of an exercise to cut 250 to 500 jobs in the enron group . security with three big market players and several major banks with commodities divisions slashing jobs at the same time , competition in the labour market will intensify and those in work are becoming wary about job security . "" what we ' re finding at the moment is that there is still demand for traders with a track record , which is possibly increasing because people are nervous about their jobs and so they ' re keen to stay put , "" gilley said . "" so whereas someone who might be a big money - spinner with a track record would have previously stayed in their job for two to three years , they are now staying for three to five years . "" they probably feel that they ' re reasonably safe where they are , they ' re well recognised and not going to stick their necks out , "" she said . bonus fears october has never traditionally been a strong month for the the jobs market in base metals as players are often distracted by lme week functions and conferences also , traders tend to be looking towards their annual performance - linked bonuses , which are usually announced at the end of the year . "" those who are in work at the moment are sticking . often at this time of year , people are hanging on for their bonuses . but i don ' t think any of them are anticipating good bonuses . they ' re probably just happy to have a job , "" sian griffiths of exchange consulting said . lme volumes traded have been fallen over the past 18 months as the powerful hedge funds that once took a shine to the metals swarmed into areas such as hi - tech and telecomms stocks . metals traders who handled the large volume of fund activity have begun to focus again on moree traditional clients , and this may yet prove a boon for the jobs market . companies are seeking to fill a shortage of staff schooled in the traditional practices of trading physical metal . "" a lot of companies who had sidelined the traditional physical business are now re - aligning their focus and need poeple who understand the physical market and know how to set up a hedge and manage it , "" gilley said . "" the other area where demand has markedly increased in comparison to a few years ago is marketing , "" she added . as for morale in the industry , individuals ' confidence in their future is seemingly undimmed .

way you suggest, if the entire package contains only references to the
final version and that only the archive name has a ""pr1"" or ""beta6"" in it
for example.Take for instance xmame : I've been packaging 0.61 pre-releases as
""0.61-fr0.x"" since the entire source has only ""0.61"" tags everywhere, no
preversion tags whatsoever.Still, I don't think ""Epoch:"" is an evil hack although it's true that it
may cause problems between distributions when used. Wanting to avoid it
when possible is a good thing indeed ;-)Matthias--

Toshiba releases monster notebook
Weighing in at 9.6 pounds, the new Toshiba Satellite 1955-S801 notebook 
has a 2.2GHz Pentium 4 desktop processor and a huge 16-inch display. The 
desktop-replacement notebook category also includes the Satellite 1905 
that Toshiba introduced last month, as well as products from Hewlett-Packard. 
Gateway and Dell may be looking at the concept too.  The Satellite 1955 will 
cost $2,499 and sports a few features not found in other desktop-replacement 
notebooks, including a detachable wireless keyboard and wireless mouse.

of the small deeply ethnic neighbourhoods, if you stray more than 50
feet from Wellesley and Jarvis or Queen and Spadina, you're in
doughnutland; there's far more like the eateries in the Eaton Centre
than there are quaint cafes like McCaul north of Dundas, and the rare
little eateries are not brimming with lunchtime traffic (you can still
find a seat at noon at Village by the Grange)When most of Toronto does not live in those neighbourhoods but instead
lives in Scarborough, Malton, Mississauga and Markham (franchisevilles), you
will quickly see that one or two trendy strips does not save an entire
nation.

this is really a two fold question . let 's talk about the selling of report # 5599 first . all you have to do is place an ad , mail the postcards or send bulk email . if you place an ad send the respondent this sales letter and let this sales letter do the rest for you - no need to talk to anyone ! ! if you mail the postcards or use bulk emailing your job is done ! the postcard will ask the respondent to send $ 50 . 00 to your mailing address . email will work for you if you send it to as many people as you can . if you decide to become an offshore broker and qualify to receive over-rides and commission on the offshore business support services the parent company will do the selling for you if you wish . this is a "" no brainer "" and can be as simple or as complicated as you want to make it . . . talk to the people if you wish or do n't - report # 5599 sells itself !

yeah i know - you ' re thinking you will need money for ads and mailing . well - i ' ve had people start with $ 50 . 00 ( u . s ) and make ten copies of the report and sold them to their associates and friends giving them $ 500 . 00 ( us ) . that gave them enough money to start running ads and to buy stamps . in looking at all the money making opportunities offered in the world today i really do n't think you can get started for any less than $ 50 . 00 and have a better legitimate money-making opportunity than the one offered in report # 5599 !

"california update # 2 , 2 / 23 / 01 1 . bankruptcy an increasingly attractive option for davis despite the fact that the lights are on and the snowpack is approaching normal levels after a month of torrential storms , back at the poker table in sacramento the situation continues to drift toward bankruptcy . indeed , almost any reading of governor gray davis ' s political situation after the shock la federal court ruling makes forcing the utilities into bankruptcy his best bet . at least one of the three major power generators ( pg & e ) seems to agree that bankruptcy is better than cutting the deal on the table now , particularly after yesterday ' s ferc ruling that it is okay for the company to shift assets around to protect them in case of bankruptcy . 2 . davis wants to keep hope alive until analyst meetings next week today is crucial in determining the exact odds of a bankruptcy since davis wants to cut a deal if possible before heading off to lead the national governor ' s association and meet with wall street analysts tuesday and wednesday . in fact , davis ' s desire to have something definitive to say next week is the only reason to believe that bankruptcy can be avoided in california . according to talks with all sides , davis has offered to buy the electricity grid from the three largest power producers ( pg & e , socal edison and san diego ) for something like $ 7 billion that they could use to pay off most of the money they owe to suppliers and creditors outside their own corporate shells . but the questions is why the utilities would want the deal that appears to be on offer and that leaves many people on both sides of the table wondering whether davis actually wants a deal or an excuse to get back to a situation where he has court - ordered cover to raise electricity rates that he knows are necessary , but politically difficult . according to key sacramento officials , "" confidence continues to wane in davis ' ability to do this . the plain fact is the stick he ' s carrying isn ' t awfully big . "" adds another : "" the key people here just think the utilities are playing him . either they ' re playing him , or he ' s going to roll on the price , he ' s going to pay double what the transmission assets are worth . the utilities got away with the same kind of thing before , in 1996 of course . "" davis is more astute than that , and a bankruptcy judge could yet be the political cover for a resolution that has been lacking since the utilities lost their court case in los angeles . 3 . little support for transmission assets deal the transmission assets deal doesn ' t look attractive for anyone . davis has no particular affinity for it , having adopted state senator burton ' s proposal when his own preferred equity warrants idea began to fade . the legislature is wary of more state involvement in the power industry , and concerned about the vast investment needed in the network . the utilities - - pg state offers only tepid support for bond scheme "" there are also more and more issues quietly emerging about utility accounting methods which the audits didn ' t pick up "" says one california official . "" the way they calculate depreciation is very strange . if the accounts were done on a proper gaap basis instead of some kind of ferc basis they would look different . "" even if the deal goes through , the financing could be difficult and very expensive . the state has definitively ruled out putting the full faith and credit of the state of california behind the proposed bonds . state treasurer angelides has also been informed it is unlikely they ' d qualify for tax - exempt status . 5 . small ipp players furious and while the big players talk , there is increasing nervousness among small independent and alternative generators . the small companies have been the biggest losers so far - - their representative , jan smutny - jones , was tossed off the board of the california iso , and the closing of the california px deprives them of the main marketing channel for their power . the ceos of large companies like dynegy and reliant are talking to davis on a daily basis , but the small companies are out of the loop . they also lack the financial resources and diversity of income streams to resist problems for long . large companies and the major bank creditors are also aware of the potential political and relationship risks across the us if they get cast in the role of villain in california . for the small companies , however , it is a matter of survival . some legislators in sacramento are operating under the assumption that it would take a creditor committee of the large generators to force bankruptcy . not so . all it takes is three creditors owed at least $ 11 , 000 each to apply for bankruptcy . two small companies , cal energy and ridgewood power , are already resorting to the courts to try to press for payment . if bankruptcy is triggered , there is immense uncertainty about what would happen . no major player we talk to is confident they can predict the outcome , especially after the shock of judge lew ' s unexpected ruling in los angeles . it is likely that the issues would have to be decided ultimately by the state supreme court . ferc and the federal government could also be ensnared as writs fly . but to many of the players , that uncertain mess following bankruptcy looks better than certain loss in a bad deal .",Safe Email

"case against theft also acknowledges that the value to the thief is often far less than the value to the victim. Stealing my $1,000 sterio and then fencing it for $50 does not result in 'no loss' the the economy overall. For the same reason that voluntary transactions increase social value, involuntary ones decrease it. If the sterio was worth as much to the theif as it was to me he'd buy it ...On the flip side of this, common law allows a breach of property law in precisely the type of scenarios where a net social gain is recorded but the owner's availability to make a contract was problematic. Breaking into your isolated cabin because I'm starving, for example, is permissible if I later offer restitution for the damage I caused and the food I ate.> -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of > Russell Turpin > Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2002 6:25 AM > To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org > Subject: Re: David Friedman: Mail Me the Money! > > R.

>list specifically dealing with MacOSX?  (which, FYI is a version of BSD)>SlÃ¡n,>TimHi Tim,
It isn't a ""version"" of anything except NeXTSTEP, with a Mac hackjob.
It has a bastardised, but functional BSD -layer- which sit's atop Mach and
uses case insensitive HFS+ but it isn't really a BSD.(Here's a neat trick, touch ""Makefile"" and ""makefile"", notice the lack of
error message but the absence of ""makefile"", and don't bother formatting for
UFS. The Apple UFS implementation performs like a dog, was frozen in 97,
implemented badly and has not been updated since. HFS+ get's tweaked every
now and then, but enough screaming has them looking at shoving UFS2 in there
somewhere down the road. )Then there's the holdover NeXT inherent weirdness, such as multiple versions
of common Unix files, but none of them do anything, and all changes you
would usually append to them have to go through NetInfo Manager.All in all, I find it to be a functional, if not overly quirky desktop
environment.As for your initial question,

Mark.

 CNETÂ TECH897.37 Â -48.86Techs fall again with telecoms, Dow drops below 8K
The day after WorldCom Group filed for bankruptcy protection, telecom shares suffered and helped drag down the tech sector.BellSouth stock tumbled 18.07 percent after it missed Wall Street's earnings target and offered a worse-than-expected outlook.  With shares of SBC Communications, Qwest Communications International, Sprint and AT&T also dropping, CNET's Tech index shed 48.86 points, or 5.3 percent, to 897.37. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 36.5 points, or 2.77 percent, to 1,282.55.With a report raising questions about Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s role in the Enron fiasco, broader markets lost ground as well. After a see-saw session, the Dow Jones industrials ended down 234.7 points, or 2.93 percent, to 7,784.5. The S&P 500 slid 27.90 points, or 3.29 percent, to 819.85.
BellSouth posts lower second-quarter profits 
BellSouth Corp., the No. 3 U.S. local telephone company, on Monday posted lower second-quarter profits due to slack demand and turbulent economic conditions in North America and Latin America.BellSouth, the dominant local telephone company in nine Southeastern states from Kentucky to Florida, said net income fell to 16 cents a share from 47 cents a year earlier. BELLSOUTH CORP 22.61 -18.11% WorldCom, BellSouth news adds to telecom gloom 
WorldCom Inc.'s bankruptcy filing is only the latest in a long line of sad news for a slumping telecom industry grappling with soft demand, falling earnings and worries about accounting.And things are not likely to change any time soon, as signaled by BellSouth Corp.'s disappointing second-quarter earnings and downward revision to its full-year outlook, analysts and investors said on Monday.WORLDCOM INC-WORLDCOM TRCK STK 0.14 55.56% HP seeks Texas justice; Gateway dinged 
In separate court cases, a Florida jury dinged Gateway for sending phone calls to the wrong business, and a federal court in Houston issued an injunction barring Emachines from selling products that infringe on Hewlett-Packard patents.
A jury in Florida ruled last week that Gateway must pay $3.6 million for a typo in which it sent customers with a PC problem to an 800 number owned by Pensacola, Fla.-based Mo' Money Associates instead of the company's own complaint line, which had a similar number but with an 888 prefix.HEWLETT-PACKARD CO 12.00 -6.25%

Analyst Mark FitzGerald expects the chip equipment maker to meet his revenue and earnings estimates of $225 million and 10 cents per share when it reports second-quarter results after the market close. He anticipates earnings guidance for the current quarter of 15-20 cents per share. The stock could move a bit higher, but FitzGerald believes better data from end markets is needed for a sustained rally. He also expects the firm to announce it will pay back $880 million in debt.NOVELLUS SYSTEMS 29.55 -0.81%

Tyco CFO's tenure seen ending as confidence wanes 
Tyco International Ltd.'s earnings release on Tuesday may very well be the last for Chief Financial Officer Mark Swartz, whose tenure has been marred by his close association with the conglomerate's disgraced former chairman.
Named CFO in 1995, Swartz has been the chief defender of Tyco's accounting, which has drawn fire for being opaque and misleading. But perhaps more important, Swartz was a key adviser and architect in Dennis Kozlowski's decade-long acquisition binge to build Tyco into one of the world's largest manufacturing conglomerates.TYCO INTERNATIONAL 11.85 -5.12%

"Has anyone had much positive experience with PKI based smartcards, email 
(S/Mime interoperability), programming to smart cards, etc.?One area in particular that seems surprising is that a number of 
projects are using cards like the Datakey 330 which seems to store data 
in a way that is proprietary to particular card/reader driver versions.I've been told, on the other hand, that Java PKI smart cards are very 
interchangable and upward compatible.  The only reasons I've been able 
to find so far for using the more 'proprietary' cards is that they may 
be cheaper and further along in FIPS validation.sdw--

"ipa i have been enjoying the discussion about how nice it would be to "" end the chaos of multiple standards "" and go to a single system recommended by the lsa - - either ipa or some cooperatively designed one . but i think it might be impossible to achieve concensus : there is not only the old "" americanist "" vs . ipa debate , but also at least two more - - one is the issue of whether to break away from or continue to use the systems that have developed over time and become standard for linguistic work in particular language families ; and the other is the disparity between linguistic writing and the official or practical writing systems accepted in language communities - - the latter often being linguistically adequate and sometimes preferred by linguists so that the speakers can have better access to the information being recorded and published by the linguist . i suppose these considerations need not keep us from attempting to come to a consensus that might encourage introductory texts in linguistics to use a particular system ; but students will still be forced to develop knowledge of multiple writing systems as soon as they start reading articles rather than textbooks . as for me , i have come to enjoy the diversity of writing systems almost as much as i enjoy the diversity of languages .

hr exec ; kitchen , louise subject : enron stock options of hpl employees gentlemen : attached below are copies of some correspondence between fran mays and me regarding the time period allowed to exercise stock options after my involuntary termination from enron due to the sale of houston pipe line to aep . apparently various stock option plans allow different time periods for exercise in such cases - - the norm seems to be three years . however , employees who were able to participate in the original "" all - employee "" stock option plan at its inception were allowed a period of only one year . it seems that employees who joined enron in years following the inception of this plan were able to participate to a limited degree , but were allowed a three - year period in the case of involuntary termination . following are the facts material to this issue : 1 . fran mays was represented to hpl employees as the authoritative source of information regarding enron benefits available to employees who would be terminated due to the sale of hpl . 2 . even though documentation of the various benefit plans exist , the documentation may not be clear in some cases and subject to interpretation by an authoritative enron source . it is always prudent for an employee to have an official company interpretation of any plan document rather than to rely on their own interpretation . 3 . in an instance of a divestiture , merger , or other change of control of a company , in my personal experience , there can be , and often are , modifications and exceptions to benefit plans . usually this is done in the interest of fairness to employees affected . in my own case in the sale of hpl , there was an exception made since i did not retire from enron , but for vesting of stock options was considered to have retired . this allowed me to be vested in some stock options that i would have lost . the monetary benefit of this exception was not significant since i only had about 25 unvested share options , but it is a precedent . 4 . i submitted to fran mays , through my supervisor , a question that specifically addressed the stock option exercise period . 5 . the only response to the specific written question that i submitted was contained in a general q & a format response from fran mays which contains an unequivocal , direct statement that the period to exercise vested options after involuntary termination due to the sale of hpl is three years . 6 . there was a disclaimer in the q & a document that referenced plan documents . a disclaimer of this sort may be useful to address details of some specific issue or to allow clarification due to some ambiguity , but a disclaimer cannot negate and reverse a direct , clear , unequivocal statement of fact . there is logic that allows the application of the disclaimer to a statement of fact . i , among a number of hpl employees who are former enron employees , made significant personal decisions based on reliance on the statement in the q & a that we had three years to exercise all options . the one year period currently being allowed can impact both exercise price and income tax consequences . although i recognize that the actual impact depends on personal decisions of when to exercise options , in my case the combined impact could be very significant . from aep ' s perspective , enron employees who agreed to stay with hpl and move to aep with the sale added a great deal of value to the hpl acquisition . it seems only reasonable to treat these former employees with a sense of fairness and not to penalize them for a career decision that benefited enron . i am requesting that the time to exercise the original all - employee options be extended to three years . this would make this stock option plan consistent with other enron stock option plans and would settle the ongoing issue of the representation to hpl employees that the period would be three years . this change would allow hpl employees who acted as loyal enron employees and made a significant career choice that benefitted enron to feel that they were treated fairly by enron . l . b . echterhoff lbechterhoff @ aep . com 832 -

- - - - original message - - - - - from : echterhoff , lal sent : thursday , may 31 , 2001 10 : 53 am to : mayes , fran l . cc : brian redmond / hou / ect @ enron subject : re : stock option questions your position that the general disclaimer on the q & a of march 8 negated the specific response to the question regarding the period to exercise stock options is unacceptable . if the answer to this specific question , shown below , was that various plans had various periods for exercise , then that should have been the answer to the question , not an unequivocal statement that the period to exercise is three years . i , and i am sure many others , made certain critical decisions based on your statement which you now claim to be of no validity . i would suggest that the remedy to this situation is to allow all stock options to have a period to exercise of three years unless earlier due to the actual expiration date stated on the grant . i use the term "" expiration date "" to be the normal expiration date that would occur is options are unexercised and that would apply to anyone continuing employment with enron . with regard to the position that the period to exercise is set by the particular stock option plan and cannot be changed , anything can be changed or special provisions made particularly in the course of a transition due to a merger , spin off or sale of a company . special provisions were made to exclude hpl employees from the new all employee stock option plan , special provisions were made to provide a 5 % payment to hpl employees in lieu of the new stock option plan , special provisions were made to consider hpl employees over the age of 55 and with more that 5 years of service as retirees to allow vesting of stock options and i feel sure that there have been other special considerations to certain employees . lal echterhoff from march 8 , 2001 , q & a : "" 1 . with the transfer to aep , will my termination be listed as involuntary so that i can exercise my vested options ? yes , your transfer to aep will be treated as an involuntary termination by reason of divestiture from enron . 2 . what is the time frame to exercise my vested stock options ? the period to exercise vested options upon involuntary termination , retirement , death or disability is three ( 3 ) years . "" . from : fran l mayes / enron @ enronxgate on 05 / 30 / 2001 02 : 14 pm subject : stock option questions we have received questions from many employees concerning the expiration date for stock options . the q & a dated march 8 , 2001 stated three years as the exercise date for options . however , on page 1 of the document , a statement was included regarding the intent of the document and that the stock option plan document will govern all provisions of the stock option program . if you have options listed on the stock option termination report which list a one year expiration , not three years as stated in question # 16 of the document , this is correct and follows the provision of the plan document . some employees have options granted under a different stock option plan and that plan carries a three year term of expiration . please review your report carefully to determine which plan your options were issued under . additionally , the document was intended to provide general information only . page 1 included the statement regarding the plan document specifically in case there were any errors made in the document . additionally , we stated that employees could obtain copies of the plan document for their review . enron provides the plan documents so that employees can familiarize themselves with the plan and make decisions based on plan document . i apologize for any confusion this may have caused , however , the plan under which the options were granted is the official document by which enron determines the termination date . please call me if you need to discuss your options , however , understand that i cannot speak with you regarding other employees ' compensation / options .",Safe Email

Ah, but you've just gotten to the crux of the
situation.  There's good design and bad design. 
There's good testing and bad testing.  The problem
is, anyone can design a good Web form, but nobody
does.  I think ""best practices"" hasn't caught up
on main street Web enablement yet.  There's some
really great packages on how to do this stuff and
in fact the usability people knew that Web forms needed
to be fixed 5 years ago, so that's why we got XForms
and  XHTML.  You can shoot yourself in the foot and
people usually do.  What the problem is, they don't
even recognize that they're gimpy--ever.  They just
keeping trundling along making a mess of everything
assured in their job security that they can build
Web forms without even caring if they can be
used or not beyond their test machine.If you had a piece of software and a security warning
came out 5 years ago on it, would you run that software?
Wouldn't you have patched or upgraded something so fundamentally
broken 4 years and 11 months ago?  What I want to know
is why would someone use Web forms best practices from
5 years ago?  I mean you can get a college degree in that
time.  Imagine if the next version of Microsoft Windows
or Red Hat Linux forced you to use a tiled window
manager?  Sure, tiled windows were the best we had for
a brief period of time, but they are completely useless
except for some terminal based replacement applications. The bottom line is, if you can't get across the
bridge, then it's broken regardless of whose fault
it really is, and it's the business that 
needs to take responsibility as they are the ones that
wanted to put the bridge there in the first place.

"call for papers : dgfs meeting 1998 call for papers as part of the annual meeting of the german linguistic society ( deutsche gesellschaft fuer sprachwissenschaft ) , to be held in halle ( saale ) , germany , march 4 / 6 1988 , there will be a workshop ( arbeitsgruppe ) on the following topic : the linguistic analysis of intercultural communication in the last thirty years research on intercultural communication has attracted increasing scientific attention not only as a result of social developments but also due to the growing interdisciplinary cooperation between different disciplines such as cultural anthropology , ethnology , sociology , and linguistics ( c . f . ehlich 1996 ) . a central topic of the linguistic analysis of intercultural communication is determined by the experience that the use of a common language system does not guarantee mutual understanding . therefore , the theoretical conception of intercultural communication ( either in everyday or in institutional situations ) is characterized by misunderstandings ( gumperz ) . analyses of the mediation of intercultural competences show that both contrastive and interactive investigations into intercultural communication are important in order to answer the questions on the contextualizations of speech actions and on their universal or culture specific characteristics . only recently , has the innovative potential of intercultural communication started to attract particular attention ( c . f . koole & ten thije 1994 ) . it has become clear that research into intercultural communication should take an interdisciplinary perspective and requires reflection on traditional linguistic categories of linguistic description in order to see which new discursive forms are facilitated by intercultural communication . the specific question to be adressed in this workshop is whether the linguistic involvement in intercultural research has resulted in the extension and enhancement of new linguistic categories and research methods . reflexion on this issue should focus on topics like procedures of assertaining understanding ( verstdndnissicherung ) ( c . f . metacommunication ) , pragmatic universals ( c . f . politeness ) , contrastive analyses of speech actions and texts , linguistic forms of perspectivity or culture comparison . references ehlich , k .

"metals - imminent actions - an update rick / rick / sally i attach the ' executive ' summary of a note sent to the office of the chair last week detailing current operational difficulties with the metals merchanting business . subsequently an ' all hands ' meeting was called to discuss the operational issues and the business imperatives of off balance sheet facility ( "" obsf "" ) renegotiation minimising working captial sap implementation the notes of that meeting are also attached at the bottom of this email should you require any further information please call , otherwise i will forward updates as they are completed . regards mike issue the physical metals business implemented an off balance sheet structure ( obsf ) pre year - end to meet enron requirements for gearing ratios . whilst this does not present undue problems for lme warrants , these being bearer documents , it does present an issue when physical metal , the value of which depends upon brand and location , is placed into the facility . given the hard deadline of year - end the operational support of this process initially took place on spreadsheets . the impact of the obsf on the operational side of the physical business should not be underestimated . the process of moving material off and on balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlements , particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in the as 400 . with the specified functionality it is believed that all operational and trading issues arising from obsf can be managed satisfactorily . the core functionality , which was due prior to the year - end , was released during january but was subsequently found to have introduced  + bugs  , to the integrated business control processes . whilst an improvement on having no obsf functionality , the  + bugs  , have had an increasingly negative effect on the control environment , compounded by the fact that it can not provide a guaranteed delivery for the  + bug  , fixes and non core  , reporting  , functionality . this has given rise to the following concerns : ? there are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at a brand & location level to coordination records ( the global position is reconciled however ) . ? it is not possible to substantiate the dpr for em & cl as : ? a ) p & l on spread moves from cash to 3 months positions ( and related cash to 3 months provisions ) can not be produced by the system and must be estimated , and ? b ) system bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values . these concerns are compounded by the following : ? the most experienced as 400 it developer for the em & cl business has resigned . he is currently working his 6 months notice which will expire in july 2001 . ? the most experienced as 400 it developer on the eml side of the business has also resigned . he left in january 2001 . ? there is no documentation for the as 400 . it is therefore difficult for experienced as 400 programmers to get upto speed on the system . conclusion it is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the as 400 system and the renegotiation of the obsf facility with barclays . the current situation has arisen due to non - delivery of it developments and tight timescales on the finalisation of the obsf facility . to meet ql end requirements ( i . e . full production of the dpr and stock reconciliation ) , it and the obsf deal team must make concrete commitments on delivery timeline . the business will not be able to commit to successful implementation of the facility and resubstantiation of the trial balance without these - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by mike jordan / lon / ect on 26 / 02 / 2001 16 : 18 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mike jordan 26 / 02 / 2001 16 : 18 to : michael r brown / lon / ect @ ect , fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , joe gold / lon / ect @ ect , michael farmer / eu / enron @ enron , michael j hutchinson / eu / enron @ enron , anne edgley / lon / ect @ ect , melissa allen / lon / ect @ ect , mark pickering / lon / ect @ ect , paul chivers / lon / ect @ ect , robert campbell / lon / ect @ ect , andrew cornfield / lon / ect @ ect , howard carter / eu / enron @ enron , bill appleby / lon / ect @ ect , david p tregar / eu / enron @ enron cc : subject : metals - imminent actions - notes of meeting 23 rd feb to all i seek to clarify the actions discussed at friday ' s meeting and to emphasise the critical importance of getting all the below completed as quickly as possible to meet our ql requirements ( revenue targets , balance sheet targets , interest expense minimisation etc ) . the proposed tactical plan that was circulated is not attached as it has already been superceded ! there was agreement on several broad areas of immediate focus with specific objectives and accountabilities - it resourcing communicate priority to hr about the importance of obtaining skilled as 400 programmers - for tactical short term and for long term work - action mp resourcing for long term as 400 ' off - load ' initiative to be completed asap - action mp merchanting resource focus to be on bug fixes impacting mo ability to update obsf options in as 400 and for traffic to update recent location movements of stock in obsf - action rc ( deadline 1 week ) completion of inception document for full obsf inventory control functionality - action rc ( deadline 1 week ) split of resources for sap interface - only eml sap implementation is now planned for 1 / 4 / 01 - action rc to confirm resource reallocation 27 / 01 immediate improvement in it operations support required ( including completion of transfer of support responsibility from dev . to ops . ) - action mp operational support mo risk / trade accounting resources to focus on rebooking all remaining transactions on obsf inventory spreadsheet - action hc ( deadline asap ) validation of system generated p & l to commence following the above - action hc ( deadline asap ) timetable for catch up of traffic obsf location movements to be completed with john lunzer 27 / 02 - action hc determine action for improvement in delivering metal to facility ( initial assumption for recent working capital increase was that we had operationally slowed down in placing qualifying material into facility ) - action hc / ac ( deadline asap ) working capital detailed daily analysis of working capital movements to be produced and formatted in style of sources and uses of funds ( including facility headroom ) - action ac ( deadline asap ) forward estimate of working capital to be produced for rest of quarter and used for estimation of full interest expense - action ac , mj & ma ( deadline asap ) analysis for trade receivables ( and reasons for recent increase ) and investigation of possible factoring - ac / mj and ae / ba ( deadline asap ) determining extent to which pricing signals for working capital usage can be communicated to traders , traffic and operations - action jg , mj ( contingent on above ) obsf negotiation documentation of current negotiation issues ( including aa sign - off issues ) to be drafted and circulated with clear accountabilities - action ma / dt / ba ( deadline 26 / 3 ) operational impact of agreement to be considered in parallel to negotiation - action hc / ac / ba lme relationship consider utilising a us subsidiary to book obsf transactions to negate lme reviewing facility as part of regulatory regime - action ma / fd monitoring notice of investigation issued by lme - action fd / dt",Safe Email

"thought i'd pass this on, my favorite radio station in raleigh is going off the internet due to the new fees and restrictions associated with remaining online. this is from the station manager and describes the situation.---------- Forwarded message ---------- Date: Tue, 3 Sep 2002 13:13:17 -0400 From: Arielle Subject: RE: KNC Stream [1:51144:51751]This message was sent from: WKNC Chat. ----------------------------------------------------------------It does, but it's not the cost that is causing us to shut it down. The cost is a ""minimum $500 per year""... but that only accounts for 18 people streaming and playing like 13 or 14 songs an hour. But we could maybe manage the 2 cents per person, per 100 songs.The problem comes with the record keeping they mandate with webstreaming. Start and end times for every song (not too hard), artist (okay), title (okay), composers (a little harder), serial number (wtf??). I think there are a few more things they wanted, but honestly, programming this info in for every song that we play is ridiculous. This means we'd also have to get all the DJs to find this info and write it down any time they play a request, vinyl, or CDs not loaded into the computer. It's ridiculous and nearly impossible...We would need someone to sit in the studio 24/7 writing down all this info - which sometimes isn't available, like from earlier album that don't have serial numbers and barcodes. Then still if only the magic 18 people webstream our signal, the price would become quite exponential since we play on average 16 songs an hour, we'd be paying $22.11 everyday to stream to those 18 people. So really, it does have to do with the internet tax, but it is a few reasons together why we can't do it after their kill-date. :( ---------------------------------------------------------------- Sent using Phorum software version 3.2.6",Safe Email
"I guess the first question here should be does anyone have some
updates to the PGP code in EXMH that I should know about?My current problem is that if I get a PGP signed message, I first
get a button that reads:
	""Check the signature with GnuPG""
If I punch the button, and I dont have the signature on my keyring
then I get a message saying just that, and the message:
	""Can't check signature: public key not found""
along with a button with the inscription
	""Query keyserver""
If I punch the button then EXMH just hangs.  Forever.If instead of punching the button, I go out to the keyserver myself
and then try the message again, everything works, so it SEEMS that it
must be the code that goes out to the keyserver.Anyone else with this problem?

coal and emissions trading the first enron online synfuel trade occurred this past week , establishing enrononline as the only online marketplace for synfuel . the purpose of bringing synfuel on enrononline is to provide market transparency between the coal / synfuel spread . the coal cash book , which began trading only two months ago , has traded over 2 million spot tons . the fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies , while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing of coal . enron energy and operational services - ena solid fuel initiative ena started development of a coal initiative late last year to support the electricity trading desk and to provide enron with a hedge in the event that the cost of natural gas continues to escalate above current long term projections . because of the culture shock associated the use of the words ' enron ' and ' coal ' in the same sentence , consideration was been given to changing the name to dng ( dense natural gas ) ; however , we went with solid fuel initiative . this initiative is developing multiple sites throughout the country where ena feels there is the greatest opportunity for long term corporate benefit . the primary areas are texas , florida , southeastern ohio and the central rocky mountain area . there are 2 principal areas currently being aggressively pursued : brownsville , tx and brighton fl . in brownsville , the team secured formal owner approval to lease a 600 acre site near the brownsville ship channel . this approval will allow the formal permitting activities to proceed without delay . a 500 mw facility is being considered for brownsville . as conceptualized , it will consist of two - 250 mw ( net ) cfb units ( circulating fluidized bed ) boilers . the boilers will be fired by petroleum coke ( petcoke ) and use a technology that will generate electricity in the most environmentally friendly way currently possible . one of the advantages of locating this facility near brownsville is that it remains a steady growth area and there is already serious interest by others to take substantial initial base load capacity . there is further synergy with other developing projects in the area that could lock down additional base capacity . as stated the plant is initially 500 mw , but will be designed to be expanded to a 1000 mw facility . the eeos team is starting to grow and currently includes hilda akin & cheryl kent , project admin assistants , bill fox as pem , and paula solomon as pcm . as the project develops there will be more team members required . in addition , as the florida opportunity develops we plan to establish a separate team . esource esource , enron ' s research group , recently posted on its website a forrester report as well as analyst reports for various industry and companies . these reports are free and available to all enron employees on the esource hot topics page at http : / / esource . enron . com / hot _ topics . asp . to date , over 1 , 600 employees have downloaded "" spending wisely on private hubs "" , a report valued at $ 2 , 000 . over 1 , 100 employees to date have viewed the analyst reports , provided by investext . the reports , which are updated continuously , are presented in folders by company and industry . new folders are being added upon request . to submit a suggestion for a new folder , please complete the suggestion form at http : / / esource . enron . com / suggestion . asp . watch for the new esource bulletin , the source . it will feature frequently requested searches , tips on finding information , new products , services , and events . meanwhile , to further fulfill enron ' s information needs , esource has arranged for analysts and bureau chiefs of various organizations and publishing houses to offer seminars to enron employees . enron freight markets efm signed a firm contract with streamline shippers association last week to provide truckload capacity for one -

!==================================================BE IN GOOD MONEY WITHIN A YEAR!!!Before 
you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been 
hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the 
Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the 
investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make 
people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was 
legal.Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely 
NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow 
the simple instructions, they are bound to make some money with only $25 out of 
pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT 
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED,Â  IT IS 
CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.This is what one had to say: 
""I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am 
so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the 
minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total 
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."" Pam Hedland, Fort 
Lee, New

is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long time 
but I never believed in it. But one day when I received it again in the mail I 
decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa 
.... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. Â The first month 
I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of 
$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have 
made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this 
program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.""More

=====For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE 
REPORTYOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name 
appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON 
YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.=== When 
you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.Â  You will need all 5 reports so that you 
can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 
5=$25.00.Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 
reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they 
will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case 
something happens to your computer.IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of 
the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in 
any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you 
will lose out on a majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this 
works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this 
method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT work !!! People have 
tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get 
all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to 
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than 
what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you.Â  Remember, honesty reaps the 
reward!!!1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this 
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5.

ACCURATELY!==========================================================**** 
Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your 
computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just 
in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the 
internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing 
information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find 
thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to 
get this venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL 
LEGALLY==========================================================Let's 
say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume 
You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that 
the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but 
lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of 
thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).Continuing with this example, 
you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders 
for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail 
each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with 
orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 
people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.Â  The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders 
for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total 
of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for 
Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total 
of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders 
for Report #5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half 
million).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 
+ 3..... $5,000 + 4.... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000Â  
Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A 
PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW 
YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY 
!=========================================================REMEMBER 
FRIENDS, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED 
TO.Â  Dare to think for a moment what 
would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 
e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet 
worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and 
more!METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE 
INTERNET=======================================================Advertising 
on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to 
advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger 
response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as 
you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the 
Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on 
it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the 
report.=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================ORDER EACH 
REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) 
for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by 
wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, 
Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL 
ADDRESS and your name and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE

now.Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put 
your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 as 
instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or 
more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.Â  Remember though, the more you send out 
the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the 
ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. 
IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !============ MORE TESTIMONIALS 
================""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in 
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good 
money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk 
mail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spouting my knowledge of the population 
and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my 
supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made 
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when 
the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had 
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 
147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 
''hobby''.Â  Mitchell Wolf M.D., 
Chicago, 
Illinois======================================================''Not 
being the gambling type, it took several weeks to make up my mind to participate 
in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment 
was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at 
least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post 
office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The 
nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There 
simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.""Â  Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, 
Canada=======================================================''I 
had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should 
have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another 
copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 
months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made 
more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks.""Â  Susan De Suza, New York, 
N.Y.=======================================================''It 
really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to 
you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money 
started to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third 
month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to 
internet."".Â  Fred Dellaca, Westport,

"fw : rto week - - state commissioners fyi . tj and claudette - - please send to your groups . thanks - - - - - original message - - - - - from : landwehr , susan m . sent : thursday , october 18 , 2001 6 : 19 pm thursday morning session - - - - meeting with state commissioners this session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at ferc taking action without including them in the decision making process . although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend , upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame . it was a long morning ! i will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts . approximately 35 to 40 % of the commenters were supportive of ferc and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts . most of these comments came from the midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support . everyone else was fairly verbal against ferc , primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process , that ferc was moving too quickly , and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens . in particular , the commissioners from maryland and north carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric . while many would think that the session was extremely negative ( our friend sarah novosel thought it was disgusting ! ) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing - - allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis . here ' s some individual comments : catherine riley / maryland - - - she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the maryland commission and immediately implied that ferc was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens ( she was way overboard in the dramatics department ) . she then stated that she was not at the meeting to "" help you ( ferc ) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record "" . it went on like this for about 15 minutes . the good part is that she was so personally negative , that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her . sam ervin / north carolina - - - he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens , that customer choice is never coming to his state , so he will never benefit from an rto , that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an rto ( and i bet if they do , he ' ll work to change the statutes ! ) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of ferc . his comments were also pretty brutal , but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor . arnetta mcrae / delware - - - she kept on saying "" show me "" where the benefits for consumers are . she also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order . rory mcminn / new mexico - - - repeatedly talked about how the west was different , how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers , how the ferc commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were . carl wood / california - - tried to portray himself and california as representing the west as a whole , and even brought along a statement from the washington commission echoeing his comments . he delivered the same messages that we ' ve been hearing forever - - - ferc should have acted sooner on price caps , etc etc . glen thomas / pennsylvania - - - he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it ' s energy system into the new century . . . that by opening it ' s markets they have had an explosion in green power , they have reduced costs all across the state , etc . he was very supportive of pjm ( makes sense because it ' s in his back yard ) and stated that for any rto to be effective it must have independent governance . judy jones / ohio - - - was very parochial in her discussion , but echoed don svanda ' s comments from earlier in the week that one rto for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the ferc to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed . ed garvey / minnesota - - - he got the gold star for the day . after very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners , he took about 1 minute and said "" ferc - - just get it done "" . . . . in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward . other commissioners who talked were : arthur / connecticut , hadley / indiana , huelsman / kentucky , nugent / maine all on the positive side . other negative commentors were two guys from dc and jim irvin from arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do . from the ferc commissioner standpoint , the gold star went to massey . after hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn ' t feel that they had been included and that ferc had not consulted them enough , he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back , saying the "" there has been 7 years of process , and he wants a process that comes to an end . . . . you ' ve been talking for 7 years and never could agree . . .

> least we can't develop and deploy them on time, My estimate is that, in the worst case, we have 17 years (5.4e8
seconds) to move it one earth radius, or about 6000 km (6e6 m).  
a t^2/2 = x, if I remember right, so a = 2x/t^2, which is 
1.2e7 m/(2.9e17 s^2), or about 4.1e-11 m/s^2, which is not a very
large acceleration, roughly equivalent to the gravitational
acceleration in these parts divided by 200000000000.  Assuming a
2km-wide --- that is, 20 000 decimeter-wide --- spherical asteroid of
specific gravity 10, 4/3 pi r^3 says it would have a volume of 4e12
cubic decimeters and thus a mass of 4e13 kg.  The force we'd have to
apply to achieve this acceleration would be roughly equivalent to the
weight of 200 kg here on Earth.So, yeah, ion drives are probably a no-go, unless I screwed up the
calculations here; I think the force they typically exert is about
four orders of magnitude too small.If we just wanted to hit today it with enough of an impulse that it
would miss us 17 years later, we'd need to accelerate it by about 1.1
cm/s.  A one-ton (1000kg) mass would need to hit it at about 4e9 m/s,
or about ten times the speed of light, to achieve this, so that's not
possible.  (If you could actually put enough work into a one-ton mass,
as it approached the speed of light, it would mass more, so you could
still do it with a one-ton mass; but we don't have anything
approaching that speed.)  The impulse required is inversely
proportional to the remaining time to impact, so if we were to hit it
after half the time has elapsed, we'd need to accelerate it by around
2.2 cm/s instead.The gravitational force of an Earth-sized mass could provide
sufficient deflection if that mass were about 4.5e5 times as far away
from the asteroid as we are from Earth's center, or about 2.7e9 m, or
about 0.018 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun (0.018 AU).
(And if that mass stayed so nearby for 17 years.)The effects of continuous acceleration benefit greatly from planning
ahead, since they scale with t^2, not t --- and thus the needed
acceleration scales with 1/t^2.  After half the time has elapsed, we'd
need four times as much acceleration to make it miss the Earth than if
we were to start accelerating it now.All of these numbers are a little low, because the Earth presents a
slightly easier target than its physical size suggests, due to its
gravity well.  How much easier depends on the speed of the projectile
in ways I don't understand.They're also a little high, because they assume the force is being
applied purely at right angles to the asteroid's current path, which
is a slightly suboptimal scenario (although for velocity changes five
orders of magnitude smaller than the relative velocity, the difference
is probably insignificant.)  And they assume there are no other effects on the asteroid's path.What about electrical charges?  Could we electrically charge the
asteroid and another nearby asteroid, perhaps with electron beams, to
provide the needed acceleration?Of course, all of this calculation could be applied in the other
direction, too.  If you want to sock a moon colony with a one-ton
asteroid, you could do it with a tiny amount of force applied over
twenty-five years to adjust its orbit.***About spam: I'm sorry to admit I haven't implemented any of the better

( it 's actually a bit more complicated than that . ) meanwhile i suggest you check a paper by ohala , ' the ethiological use of pitch ' ( i think ) , which appeared in phonetica in the early ' 80s ( again , i think ) . he has done other work on sound symbolism , including a recent book ( hinton , nichols , ohala , eds ) under that name . actually there are two by ohala , both in phonetica , one in 1983 , one in 1984 . . . in yoruba , rugudu ( hhh ) 's mall and spherical ( as buttocks ) ' vs rogodo ( hhh ) ' large and round ( as yams ) ' . if i understood your posting this fits in your ( i . e . the longzhou ) hierarchy . i came across it in child 's paper in the sound symbolism book , the original source is courtenay ( 1976 ) . nb both these words are ideophones in yoruba and there is no suggestion that these two words reflect a productive process , even among ideophones ( though i suspect no one has seriously checked out the possibility ) . dr . bruce a . connell oxford university . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . shoshoni , a uto - aztecan language spoken in the great basin of north america has something like this with demonstratives . there are two sets of prefixes which can be affixed to demonstrative stems ; the first set consists of an [ s ] followed by a vowel and has definite readings , while the second set consists of a bare vowel and has indefinite readings . these are : i ii gloss example si - i - near sit @ n ' this ' se - e - not quite so near set @ n ' this ' sa - a - far , but in sight sat @ n ' that ' su - u - not in sight , far sut @ n ' that ' in addition , there is another prefix which makes no distinction as to proximity , ma - . the forgoing information is taken from a grammatical sketch of shoshoni by the late wick miller , as well as my own field experience with the language . dirk elzinga university of arizona elzinga @ aruba . ccit . arizona . edu . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . you might want to look at my book for the vector space of vowels . the ordering above is almost a perfect match for a hilbert curve that follows the vowels at the corners of the ordinal vowel cube : hubey , h . m . ( 1994 ) mathematical and computational linguistics , mir domu tvoemu , moscow , russia , isbn 5-87553 - 001 - 4 as in many other scientific fields , particular mathematical fields are used or have been shown via experience to be useful in linguistics and most books on linguistics do n't stray too far from these methods ; i . e . the formal language theory , graph theoretic , or logic . this book covers the area starting from the most basic phonetics / phonemics to morphology , syntax and historical linguistics . almost everything in the book is original and uses mathematics to model the phenomena . what is not original is covered in the appendices . even some original ideas can be found in the appendices . it 's comprehensive and introduces mathematical methods into linguistics in a very strong , natural and non-trivial way including ; differential equations , stochastic differential equations , catastrophe theory , fuzzy mathematics , entropy , various metric spaces , vector spaces for phonemes , orthogonal basis for speech sounds , and a natural orthogonal space for sonority , vowels , and even consonants , time-domain and frequency-domain relationships , dimensional analysis , partial differential equations and permutation matrices et cetera in addition to the usual binary arithmetic , and monoids , groups , rings , karnaugh maps , sets , et cetera . you can find a free copy of the book on my home page at http : / / www . smns . montclair . edu / ~ hubey or directly try ftp ' ing to amiga . montclair . edu the http is a much better way you can get a copy of the table of contents first . regards , mark . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .",Safe Email

"Dear ilug@linux.ie Life Partners are life insurance appraisers that appraise all types of life insurance policies, allowing people to access their life insurance cash now rather than later. We help individuals unlock cash from unutilized assets. 
Individuals usually age 65 or older who find that their health, financial and/or estate planning needs have changed are typical candidates.

DO NOT drop your policy as it may be worth CASH to you NOW.Why do people sell their policies? 
The reasons individuals make the decision to sell their life insurance policies are as varied as the people themselves. Some reasons may be to:Pay off debts

I'm not sure it's loading it. For a start, the / filesystem is being
mounted as ext2, at first, not ext3. It does seem mounted as ext3 after
the fsck is done - but that means that it's mounted as ext2 read only,
fsck'ed and then remounted ext3. Losing the point of it. Given I can't pass the kernel parameters (I think), how then can I get it
to load the initrd ?Kate

periodically create hard links to every file on the hard drive that does not

you just do a save as, and set the extension to .gif - you should
get a dialog asking whether you want to merge visible layers or
save as an animation. I believe that you can also specify the
extension as .mpg or .mpeg if you've got the mpeg plug-in built.Cheers,

"I am Mr.IKE EJOH. Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6  1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes  and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Bran
ch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please replyimmediately via the private email address . Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: Thanks and regards.

is that they were going on phenotypes,
and didn't engineer the genetics.  That
example makes a good case for natural
selection, but not for artificial.(do ""married people live longer"" because
of the benefits of matrimony, or because
acceptable health is one of the qualities
selected for in spouses?)Of course, if there are FoRKs with six
or fewer biological great grandparents
(or who are offspring of Wilt) I should
eat my words; otherwise, the micro/macro

for checks: livestock owners have, over a
period of millenia, altered the genetics
of their herds to be dumber, meatier, and
more tolerant of industrial living, so if
caution is in order, they are some of the
least likely people to volunteer it.

making so much noise that it interferes with the speaker. That's wrong,
immoral and unethical no matter what the political bent of the speakers and
the protesters. Rowdy protests in their own venue (on a college campus or
some of the commons areas of DC) is perfectly fine by me. Waving signs to
get attention is fine.> That picture

not arrested? Think about what you are saying and what you are telegraphing
about your state of mind here. You WANT people to do bad things (ie, police
arresting peaceful protesters) if it can help you further your cause? That

in someone's face.One other comment... Most of the people that are protesting against taking
out the Iraqi dictator wouldn't give a rats ass if a nuke went off in NYC.
They simply wouldn't care so why in the hell should the Americal public
listen to them on matters of national security?So enlighten me, exactly why shouldn't Hussein be taken out? And if your
answr boils down to ""i don't give a shit about what happens to the US"", you

( vnbl . ob ) is a holding company , which is identifying and acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services to provide long term growth for its shareholders . vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in the security sector is unprecedented . the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 have changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in the banking , healthcare and government sectors . while the focus for vinoble is on north america , the opportunity for security services is worldwide . according to giga , a wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by 2005 . vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security market by delivering professional services , security products , security training , and managed security services . in pursuit of this objective , vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals offering a full range of security services . through vinoble ' s consulting services and integrated delivery solutions , vinoble will help organizations protect key assets including persons , property , information , brand , and reputation . homeland security , the national strategy for a secure cyberspace , the healthcare insurance portability and accountability act ( hipaa ) , sarbanes - oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued increase in security demands in the united states and abroad . vinoble intends to position itself as the ' most desired ' provider of , both , physical and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients , alliance partners , and peers . we will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are the most knowledgeable , agile , professional , and cost - conscious provider of ' tailored ' security solutions to meet the unique needs of each client . management has partnered with garcyco capital corp . ( "" gccc "" ) to assist in finding acquisition candidates for the company , structuring such acquisitions , and effecting a transition to corporate growth . at present , vinoble and gccc have targeted several companies as potential acquisition candidates . pending the outcome of due diligence and audits , the company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis required for listing on a national exchange . here is recent news on the company : malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - may 20 , 20 o 5 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb : vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services , is pleased to announce that as it continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition of assets , businesses , and strategic partners in the rfid and gps tracking sector , vinoble has further engaged with several additional businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology , software , and patents . following the move to acquire rfid ( radio frequency identification ) technology , hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use applications , the company has concluded that the need for application support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the framework which operates such technology . the company has identified several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software , and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element . middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications , both internally and externally , to the enterprise . this typically involves routing data using different transport protocols , translating data into different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as web services and service - oriented architectures . since rfid is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and non - mobile assets , user - friendly and efficient management software enabling customers to manage rfid data both incoming and out - bound is important in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with customer service . management software will allow for real time visibility of assets or product inventory , whether in transit , in a warehouse , at the manufacturing plant , or on a store shelf . visibility and accuracy will enable customers to reduce handling costs , gain instant access to shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply chain . the ability to manage data collection from a number of different rfid and gps devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system . the company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology will be essential and will further position vinoble in the vastly growing rfid and gps tracking industry . the company ' s goal is to provide critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of their personnel and assets in this current state of constant threat . safe harbor statement : this press release contains forward - looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 ( the "" act "" ) . in particular , when used in the preceding discussion , the words "" plan , "" "" confident that , "" "" believe , "" "" scheduled , "" "" expect , "" or "" intend to , "" and similar conditional expressions are intended to identify forward - looking statements within the meaning of the act and are subject to the safe harbor created by the act . such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties , and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward - looking statement . such risks and uncertainties include , but are not limited to , the ability of vinoble to complete the proposed acquisition ( s ) , the results of vinoble ' s due diligence review of the candidate ( s ) , the success of the business of the acquisition candidate ( s ) , including the ability of vinoble to continue to sell the applicable products and the acceptance of those newly designed products by the market , market conditions , the general acceptance of the company ' s products and technologies , competitive factors , timing , and other risks described in the company ' s sec reports and filings . the closing of the transaction will be subject to complete due diligence , inspections , and completion of audited financial statements in accordance to gaap as required by the sec prior to consummation . we believe the speculative near term target price is - $ o . 5 o we believe the speculative long term target price - $ 4 . oo we feel this is our best pick since december of 20 o 4 ! ! please watch this one trade monday ! disclaimer : information within this email contains "" forward looking statements "" within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 . any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions , expectations , beliefs , plans , projections , objectives , goals , assumptions or future events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be "" forward looking statements .

dictates that they are externally powered and clocked, but SmartCards used 
for security purposes (usually JavaCards) have built-in crypto co-processors 
that make clock rate irrelevant. 4mhz SmartCards can often preform triple-DES 
faster than general purpose processors clocked at ten times the speed.That said, clock rate has nothing with how trustworthy a card is. As Michael 
pointed out, there's something of an arms-race between manufacturers and 
attackers which has nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again 
what we've seen is that it's not a question of ""is it secure"", it's a 
question of ""who is it secure from and for how long?"" Security is rarely a 
question of absolutes (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather 
it's a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk. SmartCards are 
designed to address threats in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the 
$1-20 range (depending on the application).As whether or not they are ""trusted hardware"", the question again revolves 
around attacker and timeframe. One might expect a bored undergrad EE student 
to have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than, 
say, a governtment intelligence service. If your goal is to keep undergrad 
EEs from perpetrating mass fraud in the caffeteria, then a smartcard is 
likely ""trustworthy"" enough for your application. If your aim is to protect 
ICBM launch codes, then it's probably the wrong tool. In either application, 
a risk/cost ratio must justify the use of the protection measure in question.--

I remember not so long ago when eircom was put

accept mail from my address. Of course, informing
Eircom of this did nothing for about 4 months or so.IMHO stopping spammers is a great idea but I'd rather

sentence on Houellebecq and liked-minded fundamentalists have offered
millions of euros bounty for his head, so he has gone into hiding
under police protection for a few years.Or maybe some handful of Muslims are acting uppity and dragging him to
court under ""hate speech"" laws make a point about people not showin'
dem da massive respect dat dey deserve, especially these days.Or maybe some journo is trying to fill column inches on a boring day.
BTW I read Houellebecq's ""Extension du domaine de la lutte"" recently,
about a depressed computer services dude working in Paris, looking for
love and not finding it, slowing losing his marbles and trying to get
a friend of his to kill a woman, and ending up in a clinic for
nutcases...  Yikes!  Purposely provocative, very depressing, with some
unbelievably boring passages where the anti-hero writes little stories
about animals talking philosophical mumbo-jumbo to each other, quoted
inline in full for pages on end.It starts out:""On Friday evening, I was invited to a party with some colleagues from
work.  There were about thrity of us, all professionals aged from
twenty-five to forty.  At one point, some cunt started getting
undressed. She took off her T-shirt, then her bra, then her skirt, all
the while making unbelievable faces.  She pranced around for a few
seconds, then she started getting dresesd again because she didn't
know what else to do.  Anyway she never sleeps with anyone.  Which
underlines the absurdity of her behaviour.After my fourth glass of vodka I started to feel pretty bad so I had
to go lie down on a bunch of cushions behind the couch.  Shortly after
that, two girls came and sat on the couch.  Those girls are not pretty
at all, the two fat office cows actually.  They go to eat together and
read books about the development of language in children, all that
sort of stuff.""... and it's downhill from there!

"come on ! it ' s fun and easy ! ! * * * please read this email to the end * * * try it . just for fun . it will cost you 25 $ to earn at least thousands of dollars ! ! ! this thing is legal because you are buying and selling something of value : marketing reports . there is my true story . i received by email the instructions include in this letter . it interests me because the system was quite simple . in the list of people selling the reports ( as you will see above ) , there was a guy living not so far . i searched for his phone number and i called him . i just wanted to know if this system was really working . he told me his business was going very well and he was receiving from 50 $ to 150 $ in cash everyday ! that ' s why i went into this thing ! thank ' s to the computer age and the internet ! be an internet millionaire like others within a year ! ! ! before you say ' ' bull ' ' , please read the following . this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are ' ' absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can "" follow the simple instruction "" they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost ' ' . = = print this now for your future reference = = if you would like to make at least $ 500 , 000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably , please read the following . . . then read it again and again ! ! ! follow the simple instruction below and your financial dreams will come true , guaranteed ! instructions : = = = = = order all 5 reports shown on the list below = = = = = for each report , send $ 5 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering and your e - mail address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems . = = = when you place your order , make sure = = = = = = you order each of the 5 reports ! = = = you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . your total cost $ 5 x 5 = $ 25 . 00 . within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer . important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in step ' ' 1 through 6 ' ' or you will loose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work ! ! ! people have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money . but it does not work this way . believe us , some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened . so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed . because if you do , it will not work for you . remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! ! this is a legitimate business . you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it . treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time . 1 . . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this advertisement and remove the name & address of the person in report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune . 2 . . move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5 . 3 . . move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4 . 4 . . move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3 . 5 . . move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2 6 . . . . insert your name & address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name & address accurately ! this is critical to your success . take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do not make any other changes . save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going : method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receive only a 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 10 of 1 % ) response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0 . 2 % ) . also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e - mails instead of only 5 , 000 each ) . continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that ' s = 100 people responded and ordered report # 2 . those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 . those 1000 people send 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 5 million e - mail sent out . the 0 . 2 % response is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 . that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half a million dollars ) . your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00 numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands more coming on line every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . = = = = = = = = = = = available reports = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the reason for the "" cash "" is not because this is illegal or somehow "" wrong "" . it is simply about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you . order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = report # 1 : ' the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net order report # 1 from : y . l . wong p . o . box no . 71819 kowloon central post office hong kong report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net order report # 2 from : martin veronneau c . p . 70058 laval , quebec h 7 r 5 z 2 canada report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net order report # 3 from : francis kidd p . o . box 209 homestead , pa 15120 usa report # 4 : how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net order report # 4 from : m . l . frayser p . o . box 61432 fort myers , fl 33906 usa report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free order report # 5 from : stone evans 600 n . pearl , suite gl 03 dallas , tx 75201 usa $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : = = = if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do . = = = after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business !

   Version: 1.19
   File size: 1.63MB
   License: Free to try; $20.00 to buy
   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS X   One of the most frustrating things about off-the-shelf
   organizer applications is that they try to force everyone to
   keep track of things in the same way. AquilaCalendar is
   refreshingly different: you can design your own calendar
   windows, choosing from a plethora of basic options (day,
   week, month, year, several months together, and so on), customize
   your calendar with colors and fonts, and more. To-do lists
   and notes-to-self can be added to calendars or you can add a
   handy clock and holiday markers, among other options. The
   interface fits with the OS X design theme, and makes getting
   organized no more difficult than it has to be. Get organized:   http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=88-ec5PQQKx6IOkSTY-rU358atSBbiR    Want to review AquilaCalendar? Submit your opinion here:

   also need to pick up coins for extra points and stay clear
   of those nasty aliens to stay alive. Blast your way through

BUY PRODUCTS70 to 80%
BELOW WHOLESALENEW, AND IN QUANTITIES YOU NEED
A SINGLE UNIT, A PALLET,
  OR A TRUCKLOAD1. Do you consider yourself ""FINANCIALLY SECURE""?
2. Are you still looking for a very Real Business that can provide you and
  your family with the lifestyle you desire and deserve? Or,just a second
  income in your spare time?3. Would you invest $66.50 (A 25% discount off of our regular price of
  $99.95 during this limited time promotion. ) in a business that could make you
  ""FINANCIALLY SECURE""?
If so, read on:
This is not a get rich quick scheme, but, it is a way for you to get into
  a business with a minimal investment and, may be your first step towards a
  rewarding first, or second income. For the longest time, only those, who were
  able to make large investments were able to take advantage of this type of a
  business. We have made it possible for everyone to do it, and at a price
  everyone can afford.Â Corporate America has conditioned us to believe that security comes from
  employment. Yet layoffs are hitting an all time high, major corporations are
  failing and we hope to never become the victims of this downsizing, career
  burn out, illness or injury.
There was a time, when finding another job was not a problem, but today,
  the frightening reality for a lot of people is that ""the
  plastic in their wallets determines the quality of their lives.""
The hard facts show that our economy has moved from the industrial age
  into the INFORMATION, SERVICE AND RETAIL AGE. No longer can you depend on the
  corporation to provide your family with the security you seek.
If you are TIRED OF LIVING FROM PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK, and are willing to
  work a few hours per week, than this may be for you.
Please read further:
We will show you how you can buy, new, not out of date, products for PENNIES
  on the WHOLESALE DOLLAR. We will not just send a
  list, or catalog of where you can buy, but actual point and click DATABASE
  with hyperlinks to suppliersÃ¿FFFF92 websites and specials pages, with email
  addresses, phone and fax numbers, and their current HOT
  listings. Unlike othersÃ¿FFFF92 distribution businesses where you are provided with
  WHOLESALE CATALOGS, out of date CD's, or lists of Government Auctions that
  sell Jeeps for $10, (which are a myth), we provide an unlimited virtual
  database of items at up to 95% below wholesale from liquidators, not
  wholesalers, that is up-dated on a weekly/daily basis by the suppliers. And
  the products are available for immediate purchase and shipping to you.
This database is designed for the individual or a small business. Although
  there are suppliers in this database selling in large quantities, most are
  selected for their flexability in being willing sell in small quantities at
  great savings (80 to 95% Below Wholesale)
You will be able to buy such items as RCA Stereos that retail for $250.00+
  for $20.00, New Boom Boxes for $12.50 each, Palm Pilots for $39.00, Cell Phone
  Antenna Boosters that sell on TV for $19.95- - for .16 cents, Perfect Pancake
  makers as seen on TV for $19.95, for$6.50, Disney Kids' clothes at $1.85/unit,
  or Pentium computers for as little as $11.00.Â If you would like to see some sample listings and featured specials,

  the Database)Â For your protection, we provide a 30 DAY, 100%
  MONEY BACK, SATISFACTION GUARANTEE, if we have misrepresented our
  product.
What do you get for your $66.50 investment:
A, fully executable, database of 100Ã¿FFFF92s of suppliers with hyperlinks to
  their websites, fax and phone numbers and a description of what type of
  product they handle and current product specials.And, ""On-going telephone support during normal business hours.""Â Since this is such a fast changing business, with new products being added
  and deleted on a weekly or even a daily basis, all data will be provided
  within 24 hours of receipt of payment via email file transfer. ( no waiting or
  shipping and handling costs) The $66.50 is your total
  one time cost.
This DATABASE is for individuals who recognize an opportunity to make a
  substantial income. Keep in mind, everyone likes a bargain, and even more so
  when the economy is down. So, even if you just want to buy for your own use, a
  single purchase could repay your initial investment. And, remember we provide
  a 30day, full refund satisfaction guarantee.
We know that this has been a brief description, and you may want
  additional information. You may email us at adddata7080@excite.com
  for additional information and a sample of listings currently being offered by
  various suppliers. (If you give us some idea of what
  types of products interest you, we will try to include some sample listings of
  those products.)We look forward to being of service in your new venture.

Dear Sir.First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virture of its nature as being utterly confidencial and top secret. all though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, let me start by introducing myself properly to you.I am the Manager Bills and Exchange of Foreign Remittance Department of Union Bank of NIgeria (U.B.N. Headquarters Lagos Nigeria) formally Union Bank of Switzerland(UBS-AG Zurich Switzerland). In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.We discovered an abandoned sum of US$7. 5 million(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our Foreign customer who died along side his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.To this effect, I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.We need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and I. If you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter and putting in your BANK PARTICULARS, PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.Once I receive your reply, I will send you the Text of application for immediate application of Claim.Yours faithfully,DR MARKUS PHILLIPS.

This seems to be a problem in tk8.4.
There is a switch statement at lines 691-697 in ispell.tcl inside a catch.
It ends with a line ending with a backslash, followed by a blank line.This seems to be enough to confuse this verson of tk.  Removing the backslash
causes the error to go away, and the catch is not executed.

I think it won't do anything about the kernels. Come to think of it, the

"sum : v - initial languages several weeks ago i posted a query in connection with the exceedingly frequent vowel-initial lexical items of basque , in which perhaps 50 % of native nouns and adjectives are v - initial ( i exclude verbs , since ancient verbs almost invariably show a prefix * / e - / in their non-finite forms . ) i asked whether other languages ( apart from the initial-dropping languages of australia ) show a comparable frequency of initial vowels and , if so , whether a historical explanation is known . i was particularly interested in hearing about possible cases of the lenition and loss of initial voiceless plosives , an explanation proposed for an ancient stage of basque by andre ' martinet . one respondent queried whether there was adequate statistical evidence to assert that the basque case is indeed unusual . i know of no such evidence , and indeed one of my purposes was to try to find out whether basque is really as unusual as is commonly believed by vasconists . the following languages were cited in the responses . polynesian : the proto - austronesian consonant system has undergone considerable attrition in the polynesian languages , which today exhibit between eight and twelve consonants apiece . in hawaiian , in which proto - polynesian * / h / and * / ? / have been categorically lost , v - initial words appear to be rather common . but i could not find any explicit discussion of this , and my impression of such hawaiian texts as i could find is that the proportion of v - initial words probably does not approach 40 % , though i am ready to be corrected on this . niger-congo : initial vowels are frequent in a number of west african languages which are not closely related ; the initial vowels generally appear to be of morphological origin . there is uncertainty as to whether the vowels are fossilized noun-class prefixes ( the most popular explanation ) or the residue of derivational processes , such as for making agentive nouns out of verbs . in the cross river languages of nigeria , most nouns are v - initial ; in some of these languages , virtually all nouns are . here it seems clear that the initial vs are fossilizations of ancient noun-class prefixes , in most cases derived from original cv - prefixes by loss of the c . in at least some of these languages , most verb forms are also v - initial , but only because the presence of fully functional agreement markers . benue - congo languages generally lack a distinct class of adjectives . in some benue - congo languages , and especially in some bantu languages , cv - prefixes have instead been augmented for morphological reasons to yield vcv - prefixes , again producing frequent initial vowels . ancient noun-class prefixes appear to be recoverable to varying extents in many niger - congo languages , especially in bantu . importantly , the original semantic values of the prefixes can often be determined , though this is not always the case . the kwa language ( bini ) edo is unusual in that every single noun must begin with a vowel , so that even c - initial loans from english have vowels prefixed , apparently purely for morpheme-structure reasons . yoruba is noteworthy in that it has around 45 % of v - initial words , even though four of its ten vowels cannot appear initially . catalan : a rough estimate suggests that catalan words are about 32 % v - initial , rather more than one might expect in a language with 7 vowels and 22 consonants , and more , i suspect , than are typically found in romance languages . i know of no particular reason for this . arawan ( amazonia ) : many of these languages have frequent v - initial words . it is suggested ( but not established ) that these derive from the loss of initial glottals . in at least some of these languages , v - initial words differ from c - initial words in that the first group may never bear stress on the first syllable . berber : masculine - gender nouns regularly take a prefix / a - / , while feminine nouns take / ta - / . muskogean : these have vc - prefixes on v - initial words but cv - prefixes on c - initial words . it is not clear to me what this means overall . siouxan : these seem to have undergone heavy reduction of initials , not entirely unlike the australian initial-dropping languages , but the results have been complex . siouxan languages particularly show the lenition of initial / p [ h ] / > / f / > / h / , and possibly also some cases of / t [ h ] / > / h / . germanic : the change / k [ h ] / > / x / > / h / is well attested here , but not , as a rule , exclusively in word-initial position ( though sometimes in syllable-initial position ) . lenition of voiceless plosives generally is widespread in germanic . on the basis of this admittedly unscientific sample , i would therefore suggest the following conclusions : ( 1 ) languages in which 40 % or more of nouns are v - initial are not exceedingly rare , but they do not appear to be at all common . the majority of the examples come from niger - congo . ( 2 ) in niger - congo , the initial vowels derive chiefly from morphological sources , probably entirely so apart from the reduction of cv - prefixes to v - in some languages . fossilized noun-class prefixes appear to be the most widely accepted origin in most cases , and such prefixes appear to be certain in some cases , in which the semantic value of the prefixes is still recoverable . but other morphological processes may be responsible in some other cases . ( 3 ) outside of niger - congo , there appears to be little evidence of morphological origins for initial vowels , and loss of initial consonants is more usually invoked . the consonants invoked are , unsurprisingly , more likely to be glottals than oral obstruents . ( 4 ) except perhaps in siouxan , there is little or no evidence for the systematic loss of initial voiceless plosives . so what happened in basque ? i still do n't know . the american long-ranger john bengtson has for years been defending the "" fossilized noun-class prefix "" view of the basque initial vowels , for reasons of his own , but there seems to be no trace of any semantic correlations with the initial vowels , and in fact the frequency of each of the five basque vowels appears to be about the same initially as elsewhere : a > e > i > o > u . my money is therefore still on the systematic loss of certain initial consonants , but i ' ll be very surprised if i ever have to pay out or get to collect . my thanks to maile rehbock , bruce connell , max wheeler , dan everett , john koontz , david stampe , mark liberman , herbert stahlke , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy for their helpful responses . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk",Safe Email

data somewhere.  I don't want to use ZODB, as I'd like something a
person can just drop in with a default Python install.  So anydbm is
looking like my best option.I already have a setup like this using Xavier Leroy's SpamOracle, which
does the same sort of thing.  You call it from procmail, it adds a new
header, and then you can filter on that header.  Really easy.Here's how I envision this working.  Everybody gets four new mailboxes:  train-eggs
  train-spam
  trained-eggs
  trained-spamYou copy all your spam and eggs* into the ""train-"" boxes as you get it.
How frequently you do this would be up to you, but you'd get better
results if you did it more often, and you'd be wise to always copy over
anything which was misclassified.  Then, every night, the spam fairy
swoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts of
things you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam.  After she's
done, she moves your mail into the ""trained-"" folders.This would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who read
their mail right off the server.  I've spoken with some fellows at work
about Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exports
appropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well.Advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail
client to bind the key ""S"" to ""move to train-spam"" and ""H"" to ""move to
train-eggs"".  Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it'd
start showing up in mail clients.  That's the ""delete as spam"" button
Paul Graham was talking about.* The Hormel company might not think well of using the word ""ham"" as the
  opposite of ""spam"", and they've been amazingly cool about the use of
  their product name for things thus far.  So I propose we start calling
  non-spam something more innocuous (and more Monty Pythonic) such as
  ""eggs"".Neale

"sum : progressive with future time reference content - length : 6465 some time ago i posted a query concerning the possible existence of languages in which the morpheme expressing the notion of "" progressive "" may be used with future time reference , as in english : - i am leaving tomorrow . the coexistence of progressive and a future time adverbial is the decisive factor . i started from a very scanty piece of knowledge : besides english , i only know of icelandic ( quoted in a paper by karen ebert , that will appear in a volume on tense and aspect ) , and possibly kinyarwanda ( but i need more data concerning this language ) . as i suspected , this feature seems to be very rare . i got only two answers . the first one is from john koontz ( koontz @ alpha . bldr . nist . gov ) . since it is not particularly long , i reproduce it entirely : = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the dhegiha branch of mississippi valley siouan all form progressives by pairing the simple verb with a positional auxiliary , and omitting the plural / proximate marker that otherwise occurs in the plural forms and the third person singular proximate . dhatha = i he ate / eats dhatha = i they ate / eat dhathe he ( obv ) ate / eats dhathe = akha he is eating dhathe = ama they are eating the usual reading of the simple form is past / aorist . there are special auxiliary and / or enclitic constructions for habitual . the future is formed with the enclitic = tte , which requires the auxiliary following it . dhathe = tta = akha he will eat dhathe = tta = ama they will eat the future without the auxiliary expresses polite requests , and there is also a form = tta = i = the ( no auxiliary ; basically the evidential of the future ) that has the reading ` shall surely ' . dhathe = tta = i = the he / they shall surely eat note also : dhatha = bi = ama they say that he ate / eats ( not the same ama , i believe ) dhatha = i = the it seems that he ate / eats john koontz = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = answering a further request of clarification , koontz kindly added the following ( the letter b presumably stands for my syrname ) : = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ) the dhegiha branch of mississippi valley siouan all form progressives by ) pairing the simple verb with a positional auxiliary , and omitting the ) plural / proximate marker that otherwise occurs in the plural forms and the ) third person singular proximate . ) ) dhatha = i he ate / eats dhatha = i they ate / eat ) dhathe he ( obv ) ate / eats ) ) dhathe = akha he is eating dhathe = ama they are eating b ) why are there two forms : akha and ama ?

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / www . interwise . cc ( if you can't log into the site just call us , sometime the site is overloaded with hits ) call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our "" global remove list "" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully processed immediately * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *",Phishing Email

"re : mpr for 6 / 20 / 00 ted , question 1 ) the investments in calme and apachi are booked on an accrual basis . i have had several meetings with commercial and accounting representatives over the last year and all have stated that any earnings are effectively reinvested back into the assets . therefore , the market values that are reflected on the mpr are actually book values . the book values are typically adjusted the last week of the month and are 1 month behind as the internation groups wait until the gl is closed before communicating the updated values . question 2 ) thanks for the heads - up on india . i spoke with sheila glover and we are now aware of the details behind rediff . com . we need to ensure that these positions are not accounted for on the dpr by india so that we do not double - report the p & l . the long - term solution is to establish a communication line for future investments . between sheila , donna lowry , and i we can develop a plan . question 3 ) the 3 bonds that you are referencing were purchased by jeff kinneman for jim easter . during our last conversation , jim told jeff that these are strategic investments and should not be reflected on the mpr . there is still some uncertainty / confusion as to when an investment is classified as merchant . we could insist that all publically traded investments not included in the equity books would qualify . having said that , i would like to know if the gas authority of india , ltd ( gail ) and europe ' s investment in mg are considered to be merchant investments . i will be on vacation this friday and all of next week so please include david maxwell on any responses . david and i will stay in touch so as to make adjustments as needed . thanks , todd from : ted murphy 06 / 22 / 2000 03 : 07 pm to : d todd hall / hou / ect @ ect cc : sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , rick buy subject : re : mpr for 6 / 20 / 00 mr . hall , i have just reviewed the merchant portfolio summary for 6 / 20 and have the following questions : 1 ) calme shows an asset of $ 291 . 9 mm and apachi shows an asset of $ 113 . 0 mm and they show no p & l for the year is this possible in a world of changing interest rates and equity premiums and commodity prices ? 2 ) india recently invested in an ipo ( rediff . com ) for which there was a simultaneous dash to buy and sell ( sounds like a merchant deal ) . where does this show up ? 3 ) there are several bonds ( publicly traded , registrered securities , housed in our prime broker accounts ) owned by various enron entities that i do not believe are on the dpr . shouldn ' t they be ? and if so , who is deciding not to include ? pls advise at your earliest convenience as you always do . thanks ted from : d todd hall 06 / 21 / 2000 01 : 16 pm to : rick buy / hou / ect @ ect , andrea v reed / hou / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , richard causey / corp / enron @ enron , carol jean marshall / hou / ect @ ect , raymond bowen / hou / ect @ ect , jeff skilling / corp / enron @ enron , jeff donahue / hou / ect @ ect , l ' sheryl hudson / hou / ect @ ect , monica reasoner / hou / ect @ ect , hope vargas / hou / ect @ ect , adarsh vakharia / hou / ect @ ect , joseph w sutton @ enron , michael s galvan / hou / ect @ ect , maria lebeau / hou / ect @ ect , wes colwell / hou / ect @ ect , mark frevert / na / enron @ enron , thomas myers / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : mpr for 6 / 20 / 00",Safe Email

"commercialization of nasa technology hey , i thought you might like to take a look at viaspace the cohen report viaspace was founded in 1998 as a spin - off of the caltech / nasa jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) to transform technologies originally developed for space and defense markets into profitable commercial enterprises . viaspace seeks opportunities in high growth markets delivering on problems with growing global relevance by leveraging unique expertise not available elsewhere in the commercial world . viaspace sees a compelling business opportunity in the homeland security public safety and fuel cell markets . viaspace target markets are in excess of $ 100 b / yr and growing with a cagr of over 20 % . in the past six years viaspace has created three companies , spectrasensors , qwip technologies and vialogy corp . their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology , ( spectrasensors . com , qwip . com , vialogy . com ) . the company ' s current focus is on three subsidiaries , direct methanol fuel cell , arroyo sciences and ionfinity . direct liquid methanol fuel cell direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow ' s fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones . methanol fuel cells ( dfmc ) are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices . a dfmc can power a laptop for up to 10 hours on a disposable cartridge that costs $ 2 to $ 3 . a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to 3 weeks . we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating . as a disposable product , it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc . the technology is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents . toshiba , nec , sanyo , and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers . arroyo sciences , inc . arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency , nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation , supply chain , security , logistics assurance and first responder safety markets . the micro tracker product enables a wireless tracking for first responders in hazardous environments . this product combines radio frequency identification ( rfid ) tags , wireless digital communications , ground positioning satellite ( gps ) , data for 2 - d and 3 - d geolocation determination , geographic information system ( gis ) and sensor technologies . real - time processing of many high data content inputs is required for the instantaneous assessment of danger . applications include improved safety for fire department personnel in emergency situations , improved coordination of multi - agency deployments and extended operations in hazardous environments . the cobra product uses the imaging and sensing technology to provide early threat indicators for coastal surveillance and public infrastructure protection such as ports , power plants , airports , and telecommunication facilities . real time sensory and image data is processed and software is customized to discriminate between friend and foe . deepscan is a software system that provides automatic analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x -

"GAMING ADVISOR  NEWS July 16, 2002   i2corp Enters into Research and Development Agreement with Nevada Gaming Equipment Supplier For Live Remote Bingo.      
 
The general feeling of the Top Internet Lawyers and Analysts is that ""online gambling and sports betting is here to stay.Â” Attempts at trying to stop it would be largely ineffective! Banning Internet gambling and sports betting presents technical and legal problems that Governments are ill equipped to enforce. WhatÂ’s more, there are NO competitors for the CompanyÂ’s method or technology for remote wagering. i2corp is the Only Company in the World that can legally license its method and technology for remote wagering. i2corp is currently negotiating with
Major Casinos Globally.    
 
Michael Pollock of the Pollock Gaming Resource Group (PRRG) has issued a report studying the effects of live wagering from remote locations. Â“ The study concludes that live wagering from remote locations does more than create a new source of revenue for sponsoring casinos. Additionally, it creates a marketing opportunity, a means to find and cultivate thousands of new customers who can be encouraged to become on-site patrons.Â” A copy of the full report in pdf format can be downloaded at http://www.gamingobserver.com/.
 
i2corp is the holding company for Home Gambling Network, Inc. HGN holds U.S. Patent 5,800,268, which covers remote wagering on live games and events with electronic financial transactions. The Patent is comprised of three primary actions: the gambling is live; the player is remote and physically away from the actual game or event; and the winnings and losses are transacted electronically in real time. They include, but are not limited to, horse racing, soccer, bingo, poker, roulette and many other Las Vegas Casino Games. FACT: Currently there is an overwhelming opinion that remote wagering in real-time will become one of the most profitable/prolific industries worldwide. i2corp recently won judgment against giant UUNET a subsidiary of MCI/WorldCom in a U.S. Federal Court for Patent infringement. Just another compelling reason why i2corp has orphaned their competition! Therefore we conclude i2corpÂ’s common stock to be overlooked and undervalued! RECOMMENDATION: STRONG BUY     i2corp

Date: Not suppliedGreat article on a group of East Bay activists who rehab junk computers, using 
semi-skilled volunteers who train other semi-skilled volunteers. The resulting 
computers are sent to the developing world for activist use.     For the Amazonian villages where there's no electricity or where phone 
    lines are scarce, the activists plan to set up free computer labs in the 
    nearby cities. Many cities already have commercial Internet cafes, but they 
    cost about a dollar per hour of use, Henshaw-Plath says, which is about a 
    day's wage for most of the population.     The IMC activists plan to ship off these computers to Guayaquil, Ecuador's 
    main port city, by the end of September. Because none of the computers are 
    being sold in Ecuador, and because they're being transferred from an 
    American nonprofit to an Ecuadorian one, the activists won't be charged any 
    international shipping duties on the computers. ""It's what you call real 
    free trade,"" says Eddie Nix.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Markoffcharney!_)[1] http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/09/23/antiglobal_geeks/index.html

"ua appeal : arief budiman urgent action appeal : re : the unhonorable discharge of dr . arief budiman from university of satya wacana , salatiga , indonesia dr . arief budiman , one of the most consistent defenders of freedom of speech in indonesia and an outspoken critic of indonesian government , was fired from his position as a senior lecturer in the post graduate department at the christian university of satya wacana ( uksw ) , salatiga , indonesia . the letter of dismissal that will take effect on october 31st , 1994 , was issued on october 17th , and was cosigned by prof . haryono semangun ( chairman ) and drs . nelky oemboe nganggoe ( secretary ) of the university 's board of trustees . the letter said that dr . budiman has been unhonorably discharged because of not following the critique ethics adopted by the university . he was also accused of circulating issues discrediting the university 's board of trustees and rector . what dr . budiman actually did was only publicly expressing critical opinion againts the board 's controversial decision on the appoinment of the new rector , dr . john ihalauw . previously , dr . budiman received two letters of reprimand from the board , but no specific "" misconduct "" was mentioned in both letters . two additional notes must be mentioned . first , over the year the board has been under constant pressures from the majority of the faculty members , students , and administrative staffs of the university to revoke the appointment of the new rector , which was considered illegitimate . the same academic community has expressed public support for dr . budiman 's initiative to file a lawsuit againts the board . secondly , all of this is taking place as an increasingly sweeping clamp - down of intellectual activism has been heightening in the past two weeks , presumably in preparation for the upcoming apec summit in jakarta this november . there is a possibility that this dismissal was also intended at punishing dr . budiman and closing his opportunities to continue expressing his criticism to the indonesian authorities . in a separate case , dr . george junus aditjondro , another uksw 's lecturer and a close friend of dr . budiman , is still under police 's interrogation for insulting the state authorities while speaking in a seminar in another campus . this arbitrary measure againts dr . budiman has demonstrated how such an academic institution as uksw has violated the principles of freedom of speech and has threatened the democratic atmosphere within the academic community . his dismissal will be detrimental not only to the world-wide known reputation of uksw as one of more committed universities , but also to the dynamic of indonesia intelectual and academic life as well . as members of academic communities and individuals who are concerned with the maintenance of freedom of speech , we should express our concern to this arbitrary action . please send letter , fax , or make a call to the board of trustess of uksw for : - expressing concern at the unhonorable discharge of dr . arief budiman - asking the board to reconsider the decision and to give dr . arif budiman an opportunity to defend himself in front of the university 's senate and academic community in general . mailing address : prof . dr . ir . haryono semangun ketua umum dewan pengurus yayasan perguruan tinggi kristen satya wacana ( board of trustees satya wacana christian university ) jl . diponegoro 52-60 salatiga 50711 indonesia phones : ( 62 ) ( 298 ) - , 81362 , 81363 , 81364 fax : ( 62 ) ( 298 ) 81420 telex : 22364 ukswsa ia for more information , e-mail : amrih widodo at awidodo @ facstaff . uwisc . edu heri akhmadi at jpnn @ clark . net",Safe Email

"re : 5 . 1305 qs : canadian american , ipa - fonts for dos , genre analysis , it may be of general interest to note some differences between canadian and american accents , bearing in mind that both types of accents vary quite a bit , and that what is characteristic of some parts of canada may be characteristic of some parts of the us . for example , one of the most widespread characteristics of canadian english is the merger of short o and long open o , e . g . , hock vs . hawk . although this is also characteristic of certain areas of the us , they are generally not contiguous with the canadian areas of the merger . thus , most of the us border area with canada maintains a distinction . this , then , is a striking contrast , geographically , between canada and the adjacent us at most points . the stereotypical canadian feature , for canadians themselves , and for others who know ( including those who must have handed the canadians their self-stereotype ) is the pronunciation of / aw / as in "" out "" , "" house "" , etc . the nucleus is mid rather than low , so that it sounds something like long o as in "" oat "" as spoken by standard british or philadelphian speakers . commonalities between canada and the adjacent us , similar to the last mentioned feature , is the raising of the nucleus of / ay / as in "" right "" . this seems to keep getting discussed in the context of causing a vowel contrast between "" writer "" and "" rider "" . the canadian and upstate ny contrast has to do with height along the center of vowel space , rather than along the periphery ( central vs . back nucleus ) as in new york city . upstate ny at least , though , seems to be distinct in canada by the more extreme raising of the nucleus of / ay / , and it often sound fronted , as if like a more widespread american / ey / sound , as in "" eight "" . canada is more extreme than the adjacent us in its raising ( from low to mid ) of the / aw / nucleus - the stereotype i discussed above . i have not seen discussion elsewhere of how canadian english deals with short o before r in open syllables . more than most american dialects , it lengthens and raises them to merge with long o , so that "" sorry "" rhymes with "" story "" . this is rare for the words "" sorry "" , "" sorrow "" , "" borrow "" and a few others across us dialects , although it is general in r-ful areas for "" forest "" , "" orange "" and most such words . in this case , the adjacent us dialects , e . g . , northern wisconsin , agree with canada , so that there is a continuum , not the striking border distinction observed for the hock : hawk merger . that 's enough , although i welcome observations on other and more localised canadian and border us dialects . as for the british , when they have an american actor and do n't want to make anything out of the fact that he 's american in a film , they call him canadian - - in order to explain the accent . apparently they do n't hear the difference - - i guess they only hear flapped t 's , but think americans have to be stereotyped as characters , while canadians have more latitude .",Safe Email

Gen 44.8) is used to mean steal silver and gold amongst other things.In July 1999, I made the following comment in response to a similar
claim about the ""real"" meaning of one of the ten commandments:""""""

knowledge of the meaning of the Hebrew word ""ratsach"". Most modern
translations I've seen translate it ""murder"" but elsewhere the word is
used
of an animal killing a human (something for which most English speakers
wouldn't use the word ""murder"").

"OK, let's bring some data into the discussion:
http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/02.htm
(A graph, derived from Vostok ice core samples, of CO2 and temperature
fluctuations over the past 400k years).> Recent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and
> temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest
> correlation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases
> are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the
> increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature
> preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done
> of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are
> correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly
> causative.Based on the Vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlation
between temperature and CO2 concentrations, but it doesn't always appear to
be causal.> With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to
> point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly
> regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.Also correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm CO2.> As it
> happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous
> cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data.Not correct. Mauna Loa data  and
 show that the current CO2
concentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded
value from the past 400k years. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations are growing
at 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the
Vostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn't capable of such fine
resolution).> In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels,No, we are *definitely* adding to CO2 levels. Look at the following chart:
http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/07.htm
(Shows CO2 concentrations since 1870, the ""historical record"").Not only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostok
record, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing.
There is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except for
anthropogenic input. You're really out on the fringe if you're debating
this -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point.> but it looks a lot like we
> would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical
> record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2
> concentrations.Wrong again. Current CO2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past
400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows CO2 levels to quickly
spike, and then return back to ""normal"" background levels (and hence the
spike might not show up in the ice cores).Still, by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm CO2, a level that
even you would have a hard time arguing away.> Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately
> affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely
> predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative
> feedback systems mentioned above.Yes, clouds and oceans are a big unknown. Still, we know ocean water has a
finite capacity to store CO2, and if the world temperature doesn't increase,
but we all have Seattle-like weather all the time, the effects would be
enormous.> Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it
> makes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and
> methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule
> basis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something
> that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the
> biosphere.Correct.Data on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses:
http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/05.htmNote that methane concentrations now are *much* higher than pre-industrial
levels (many cows farting, and rice paddies outgassing), and methane is also
a contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor. Another clearly
anthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. I'm in favor of reductions in
methane levels as well.Data on water vapor here:
http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html> CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent
> studies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a
> passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.I tend to think that holistic, and techical approaches would work best in
reducing global warming. I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar,
wind and nuclear, with all carbon-based combustion using renewable sources
of C-H bonds. Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense
(burying trees deep underground, for example). Approaches that involve
reductions in lifestyle to a ""sustainable"" level are unrealistic --
Americans just won't do it (you'd be surprised at the number of climate
change researchers driving SUVs). But, as California showed during last
year's energy crisis, shifts in patterns of consumption are possible, and
improved efficiency is an easy sell.- Jim

"$ 7 money maker and e - mail service please follow the instructions of this letter very carefully . immediately print it and read twice . greetings hopefully my name is still on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is the same as the letter in front of you now . he asked me to verify the fact that this letter was legal . i told him that i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off-the - wall idea to make money . a week later i met again with my client to discuss the issue . i told him that the letter originally brought to me was not 100 % legal . my client asked me to alter the letter to make it 100 % legal . i advised him to make a small change in the letter and it would be all right . i was curious about the letter , so he told me how it works . i thought it was a long shot , so i decided against participating . before my client left , i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later he called to tell me that he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! ! ! i didn t believe him , so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself . i thought about it for a few days and decided that there was not much to lose . i followed his instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters . sure enough the money started coming in ! it came slowly at first , but after three weeks i was getting more than i could open in a day . after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it totaled $ 868 , 439 . 00 . i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i told myself if things worked out i would retire from practice and play golf . i decided to try the letter again , but this time i sent out 500 letters . well , three months after that i had totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 . 00 ! i just couldn t believe it . i met my old client for lunch to find out how this works . he told me that there were a few similar letters going around . what made this one different is the fact that there are seven names on the letter , not five like most others . that fact alone resulted in more returns . the other factor was the advice i gave him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal , since no one wants to risk doing anything illegal . i bet now you are curious about what little changes i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to be legal , you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar . i told him that anyone sending a dollar out must receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list , you must include a slip of paper saying please put me on your mailing list and include your name , mailing address and e-mail address ( your phone # is optional ) . this is the key to the program !

"This article from NYTimes.com 
has been sent to you by luke@applix.com.
The mind boggles at the idea that the Bush administration has not bothered to find a serious rationale at all, much less one extraordinary enough to justify these extraordinary measures, much less present it to the public, and that the Bush administration appears to be against American-style justice.The default explanation for government secrecy is to conceal official wrongdoing.  The administration is here making the case that Americans don't even have a right to question government secrecy.We may find that the history of this past year has been an epic looting from the public, made possible by the urgency of reacting to 9/11.

After Sept. 11, a Legal Battle Over Limits of Civil LibertyAugust 4, 2002
By THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 This article was reported and written by Adam Liptak, Neil
A. Lewis and Benjamin Weiser. In the fearful aftermath of Sept. 11, Attorney General John
Ashcroft vowed to use the full might of the federal
government and ""every available statute"" to hunt down and
punish ""the terrorists among us."" The roundup that followed the attacks, conducted with
wartime urgency and uncommon secrecy, led to the detentions
of more than 1,200 people suspected of violating
immigration laws, being material witnesses to terrorism or
fighting for the enemy. The government's effort has produced few if any law
enforcement coups. Most of the detainees have since been
released or deported, with fewer than 200 still being held.
But it has provoked a sprawling legal battle, now being
waged in federal courthouses around the country, that
experts say has begun to redefine the delicate balance
between individual liberties and national security. The main combatants are the attorney general and federal
prosecutors on one side and a network of public defenders,
immigration and criminal defense lawyers, civil
libertarians and some constitutional scholars on the other,
with federal judges in between. The government's record has so far been decidedly mixed. As
it has pushed civil liberties protections to their limits,
the courts, particularly at the trial level, have pushed
back, stopping well short of endorsing Mr. Ashcroft's
tactics or the rationales he has offered to justify them.
Federal judges have, however, allowed the government to
hold two American citizens without charges in military
brigs, indefinitely, incommunicado and without a road map
for how they might even challenge their detentions. In the nation's history, the greatest battles over the
reach of government power have occurred against the
backdrop of wartime. Some scholars say the current
restrictions on civil liberties are relatively minor by
historical standards and in light of the risks the nation
faces. The current struggle centers on three sets of issues.
People held simply for immigration violations have objected
to new rules requiring that their cases be heard in secret,
and they have leveraged those challenges into an attack on
what they call unconstitutional preventive detentions. People brought in and jailed as material witnesses, those
thought to have information about terrorist plots, have
argued that they should not be held to give testimony in
grand jury investigations. Finally, Yasser Esam Hamdi and Jose Padilla, the two
Americans labeled ""enemy combatants"" for what the
government contends is more direct involvement with
terrorist groups, are seeking rights once thought to be
fundamental to American citizens, like a lawyer's
representation and a chance to challenge their detentions
before a civilian judge. So far, federal judges in Newark and Detroit have ordered
secret deportation proceedings opened to public scrutiny,
and on Friday a federal district judge in Washington
ordered that the identities of most of the detainees be
made public under the Freedom of Information Act. ""Secret arrests,"" Judge Gladys Kessler wrote in the
decision on Friday, ""are a concept odious to a democratic
society."" A senior Justice Department official said the detentions
had been lawful and effective. He said it was hard to
""prove a negative"" and cite specific terrorist acts that
had been disrupted. But he said that department officials
believed that the detentions had ""incapacitated and
disrupted some ongoing terrorist plans."" Two federal judges in New York have differed sharply on
whether the government may jail material witnesses while
they wait to testify in grand jury investigations. In
Virginia, a federal judge ordered the government to allow
Mr. Hamdi to consult a lawyer. ""I look at the federal district court judges and just cheer
them on, because they are doing exactly what an independent
judiciary should be doing,"" said Jane E. Kirtley, a
professor at the University of Minnesota and former
executive director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom
of the Press. ""It's not hostile or adversarial; it's simply
skeptical."" These lower-court decisions have for the most part not yet
been tested on appeal, and there is reason to think that
appeals courts and the Supreme Court will prove more
sympathetic to the government's tactics and arguments. The federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., for instance,
reversed the decision to allow Mr. Hamdi to talk to a
lawyer and ordered the lower court judge to consider
additional evidence and arguments. But even the appeals court seemed torn, and it rejected the
government's sweeping argument that the courts have no role
in reviewing the government's designation of an American
citizen as an enemy combatant. The detention issues also carry an emotional punch. Many of
the Arabs and Muslims caught in the government dragnet were
cabdrivers, construction workers or other types of
laborers, and some spent up to seven months in jail before
being cleared of terrorism ties and deported or released. Last month, at a conference held by a federal appeals
court, Warren Christopher, the secretary of state in the
Clinton administration, snapped at Viet Dinh, an assistant
attorney general under President Bush, saying that the
administration's refusal to identify the people it had
detained reminded him of the ""disappeareds"" in Argentina. ""I'll never forget going to Argentina and seeing the
mothers marching in the streets asking for the names of
those being held by the government,"" Mr. Christopher said.
""We must be very careful in this country about taking
people into custody without revealing their names."" Mr. Dinh, who came to the United States as a refugee from
Vietnam, recalled his family's anguish when his father was
taken away in 1975 for ""re-education."" In contrast, he
said, those detained by the United States were not being
secretly held but were allowed to go to the press and seek
lawyers. ""These are not incognito detentions,"" he said. ""The only
thing we will not do is provide a road map for the
investigations."" According to the Justice Department, 752 of the more than
1,200 people detained since Sept. 11 were held on
immigration charges. Officials said recently that 81
remained in detention. Court papers indicate there were
about two dozen material witnesses, while most of the other
detainees were held on various state and federal criminal
charges. President Bush also has announced plans to try suspected
foreign terrorists before military tribunals, though no
such charges have been brought yet. Last month, William G. Young, the federal judge presiding
in Boston over the criminal case against Richard C. Reid, a
British citizen accused of trying to detonate a bomb in his
shoe on a trans-Atlantic flight, noted that the very
establishment of those tribunals ""has the effect of
diminishing the American jury, once the central feature of
American justice."" Judge Young, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan,
added: ""This is the most profound shift in our legal
institutions in my lifetime and - most remarkable of all -
it has taken place without engaging any broad public
interest whatsoever."" Jack Goldsmith and Cass R. Sunstein, professors at the
University of Chicago Law School, have written that the
Bush administration's policies are a minimal challenge to
civil liberties especially compared with changes during the
times of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt. What
has changed, they say, is a greater sensitivity to civil
liberties and a vast increase in mistrust of government. The Secrecy U.S. Says Hearings 
Are Not Trials Ten days
after last September's attacks, Michael J. Creppy, the
nation's chief immigration judge, quietly issued sweeping
instructions to hundreds of judges for what would turn out
to be more than 600 ""special interest"" immigration cases. ""Each of these cases is to be heard separately from all
other cases on the docket,"" Judge Creppy wrote. ""The
courtroom must be closed for these cases - no visitors, no
family, and no press."" ""This restriction,"" he continued, ""includes confirming or
denying whether such a case is on the docket."" The government has never formally explained how it decided
which visa violators would be singled out for this
extraordinary process, and it has insisted that the
designations could not be reviewed by the courts. But as it turns out, most of these cases involved Arab and
Muslim men who were detained in fairly haphazard ways, for
example at traffic stops or through tips from suspicious
neighbors. Law enforcement officials have acknowledged that
only a few of these detainees had any significant
information about possible terrorists. As the ruling on Friday in Washington suggests, a series of
legal challenges to this secrecy has resulted in striking
legal setbacks for the administration. Several courts have
ordered the proceedings opened and have voiced considerable
skepticism about the government's justifications for its
detention policies generally. Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties
Union, said the secrecy of the proceedings exacerbated the
hardships faced by people who disappeared from sight on
violations that in the past would not have resulted in
incarceration. ""Preventive detention,"" he said, ""is such a radical
departure from constitutional traditions that we certainly
shouldn't be undertaking it solely on the Justice
Department's say-so."" Malek Zeidan's detention would have been unexceptional had
it not given rise to one of the legal challenges that
threatens to end the secret proceedings. Mr. Zeidan, 42, is a Syrian citizen who overstayed his visa
14 years ago and has lived in Paterson, N.J., for more than
a decade. Over the years, he has delivered pizzas, driven
an ice cream truck and pumped gas. When the Immigration and
Naturalization Service came around last Jan. 31 to ask him
about a former roommate suspected of marriage fraud, Mr.
Zeidan was working at Dunkin' Donuts, and his expired visa
soon cost him 40 days in custody. When a hearing was finally held three weeks after his
detention, the judge closed the courtroom, excluding Mr.
Zeidan's cousin and reporters. The closing of proceedings prompted lawsuits in federal
court, from both Mr. Zeidan and two New Jersey newspapers.
In March, the government dropped the ""special interest""
designation, Mr. Zeiden was released after posting a bond,
and the case he filed was dismissed. The immigration
charges against him will be considered in the fall. ""You're one of the lucky ones,"" his lawyer, Regis
Fernandez, recalls telling Mr. Zeidan, given that other
visa violators were held as long as six or seven months
before being deported or released. Mr. Zeidan's lawyers believe that their legal strategy,
which focused on openness, forced the government's hand. ""The government was somehow linking secrecy to guilt,"" Mr.
Fernandez said. ""We figured if the public had access to
these hearings they would see that nothing went on except
multiple adjournments and delay."" Through a spokeswoman, Judge Creppy declined to comment. An
I.N.S. official, who spoke on the condition that he not be
named, said the agency had acted properly in Mr. Zeidan's
case and in similar cases. He said the immigration service had always detained people
without bond who were linked to criminal investigations. He
added that the agency had no choice now but to detain a
visa violator until the Federal Bureau of Investigation was
sure the person was not involved in terrorism. ""Consider the flip side - that you held him for two days
and then deported him, and 30 days later you found out he
was a terrorist,"" the official said. The newspapers' lawsuit has continued. It has already once
reached the Supreme Court, and the government's papers
contain one of the fullest accounts of its position on
secrecy and executive power. Its main argument is that the courts have no role because
immigration hearings are not really trials, but are merely
administrative hearings that can be closed at will. Bennet Zurofsky, who also represented Mr. Zeidan, said he
was flabbergasted by this suggestion. ""A trial is a trial,"" he said. ""A person's liberty is at
stake. A person is being held in jail. A person is being
told where to live."" But in a sworn statement submitted in several court cases,
Dale L. Watson, the executive assistant director for
counterterrorism and counterintelligence at the F.B.I.,
outlined the reasoning behind the government demand for
total secrecy. ""Bits and pieces of information that may appear innocuous
in isolation can be fit into a bigger picture by terrorist
groups,"" he said. This rationale for withholding information, sometimes
called the mosaic theory, is controversial. ""It's impossible to refute,"" Professor Kirtley said,
""because who can say with certainty that it's not true?"" In May, John W. Bissell, the chief judge of the federal
district court in Newark, appointed by President Reagan,
ruled for the newspapers and ordered all deportation
hearings nationwide to be opened, unless the government is
able to show a need for a closed hearing on a case-by-case
basis. His ruling followed a similar one in Detroit the
month before, though that case involved only a single
detainee. The government appealed to the Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, and asked it to block Judge
Bissell's order until the appeal was decided. The court,
which will hear arguments in September, declined to do
that. A number of news organizations, including The New
York Times, filed a brief as a friend of the court in
support of the newspapers. The government then asked the United States Supreme Court
to stay Judge Bissell's order. The court, in a relatively
unusual move given that the case was not before it for any
other purpose, blocked Judge Bissell's order, suggesting
that it might have more sympathy for the government's
arguments. The Witnesses Rights Violated, 
Lawyers Contend Late on Sept. 12, federal agents pulled
two nervous Indian men, Mohammed Jaweed Azmath and Syed Gul
Mohammed Shah, off an Amtrak train near Fort Worth. They
were carrying box cutters, black hair dye and about $5,000
in cash and had also shaved their body hair. The agents' suspicions were obvious. The hijackers had used
box cutters and knives to take control of the aircraft and
had received letters instructing them to ""shave excess hair
from the body."" An F.B.I. affidavit dated Sept. 15 said
there was probable cause to believe that both of the Indian
men were involved in, or ""were associated"" with, those
responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. But even though government officials told reporters that
the men had been detained as material witnesses, their
lawyers now say that they were held last fall only on
immigration violations. The distinction is important because a material witness
warrant brings the automatic appointment of a
government-paid lawyer, while the government does not have
to supply a visa violator with counsel. As a result, the authorities were able to question each of
the men repeatedly about terrorism without a lawyer
present, their current lawyers say. Like some of the people who were picked up as material
witnesses, the Indian men were held in isolation in jails
in New York for extended periods. It was 91 days before Mr.
Azmath received a lawyer and 57 days before Mr. Shah did,
their lawyers say. ""It's wrong to keep a man in jail for 57 days and never
bring him before a magistrate to advise him of his rights,""
Mr. Shah's lawyer, Lawrence K. Feitell, said in an
interview. ""It's wrong not to provide him with an attorney
at the threshold. It's wrong to depict this as an I.N.S.
investigation, when in truth and in fact, it's the main
inquiry into the World Trade Center debacle."" Anthony L. Ricco, the lawyer for Mr. Azmath, said his
client was interrogated ""often times for several hours a
day, with multiple interviewers, getting rapid-fire
questions from three or four different people."" Eventually, the F.B.I. and the prosecutors cleared the men
of any involvement in terrorism, and both pleaded guilty in
June in a credit-card fraud scheme and are awaiting
sentencing. Federal prosecutors said in court papers that both men
consented to questioning. Each ""was read and waived his
Miranda rights before each interview,"" prosecutors wrote,
adding that each man confessed to the credit card offenses.
The United States attorney in Manhattan, James B. Comey,
would not comment on the specific cases, but said generally
of the government's tactics: ""I don't see any violation of
any rule, regulation, or law. ""I can understand defense lawyers not being happy,"" he
said. ""But I know our position after 9/11 was to use every
available tool, to stay within the rules but play the whole
field and recognize the boundaries, but cover the whole
field. ""We need to do whatever we can that's legal to investigate
and disrupt,"" he added. Today, it is believed that only a handful of the two dozen
material witnesses, perhaps as few as two, are still being
detained. But the process of detaining the witnesses has stirred
intense criticism. Last April, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District
Court in Manhattan ruled that the use of the law ""to detain
people who are presumed innocent under our Constitution in
order to prevent potential crimes is an illegitimate use of
the statute."" Judge Scheindlin said the material witness law applied when
witnesses were held to give testimony at trials, not for
grand jury investigations. ""Since 1789,"" Judge Scheindlin
said, ""no Congress has granted the government the authority
to imprison an innocent person in order to guarantee that
he will testify before a grand jury conducting a criminal
investigation."" Then last month, Chief Judge Michael B. Mukasey, also of
Federal District Court in Manhattan, upheld the
government's use of the material witness statute in grand
jury investigations, criticizing Judge Scheindlin's
reasoning. Judge Mukasey, citing the assertion in 1807 by Chief
Justice John Marshall that ""the public has a right to every
man's evidence,"" held that detentions of material witnesses
during investigations are proper. The War Captives No Lawyers Allowed 
Under U.S. Label Yasser Esam Hamdi, a
Saudi national who was captured in Afghanistan, is probably
an American citizen by virtue of having been born in
Louisiana. His case represents the core issue of what kind
of role the nation's courts should have, if any, in
reviewing the government's imprisonment of someone charged
with something akin to a war crime. Prosecutors will be back in Federal District Court in
Norfolk, Va., next Thursday to confront one of the federal
judges who has shown resistance to the government's
approach that once someone is declared an ""enemy combatant""
by the president, all judicial review ceases. Judge Robert G. Doumar, an appointee of President Reagan,
has twice ruled that Mr. Hamdi is entitled to a lawyer and
ordered the government to allow Frank Dunham, the federal
public defender, to be allowed to visit him without
government officials or listening devices. Judge Doumar
said that ""fair play and fundamental justice"" require it.
He said the government ""could not cite one case where a
prisoner of any variety within the jurisdiction of a United
States District Court, who was held incommunicado and
indefinitely."" But the three-judge panel of the appeals court stayed Judge
Doumar's order, saying he had not fully considered the
government's needs to keep Mr. Hamdi incommunicado and,
more important, the executive branch's primacy in areas of
foreign and military affairs. ""The authority to capture those who take up arms against
America belongs to the commander in chief,"" Chief Judge J.
Harvie Wilkinson 3rd wrote for the appeals panel. But even Judge Wilkinson seemed to evince some surprise at
the breadth of what the government was asserting when he
asked the Justice Department's lawyer, ""You are saying that
the judiciary has no right to inquire at all into someone's
stature as an enemy combatant?"" The government has relented slightly, agreeing to provide
the court with a sealed declaration of the criteria by
which they have judged Mr. Hamdi to be an enemy combatant.
But the government has argued that judges cannot argue with
the standards. Judge Doumar has indicated that he will question the
government closely on those standards. The case of Jose Padilla, which has not progressed as far
as that of Mr. Hamdi, may present an even greater challenge
to normal judicial procedures. Mr. Padilla, also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir, is, like
Mr. Hamdi, an American citizen, imprisoned in a naval brig
after having been declared an enemy combatant. But unlike
Mr. Hamdi, Mr. Padilla was not arrested on the battlefield
by the military but on United States soil by civil law
enforcement authorities, on May 8 in Chicago. After his detention as a material witness based on
suspicions that he was seeking to obtain material and
information to build a radioactive bomb, he was transferred
to military custody. ""This is the model we all fear or should fear,"" said Mr.
Dunham, the public defender. ""The executive branch can
arrest an American citizen here and then declare him an
enemy combatant and put him outside the reach of the
courts. They can keep him indefinitely without charging him
or giving him access to a lawyer or presenting any
evidence.""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/04/national/04CIVI.html?ex=1029550865&ei=1&en=c82350bcf915e44eHOW TO ADVERTISE

You guessed the problem correctly in an earlier e-mail There was still

Its a little confusing but you install rpms like
rpm -ivh packagename-0.1.1.rpm 
uninstalls must be done without the version info like
rpm -e packagename   ie: rpm -e sendmail or 
rpm -e sendmail-devel. give that a go and it should work np. Phil,

    they be, and how'd they get on?     *Mark:* The zine would be Jethro Bodine of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" -- 
    curious, neophilic, xenophilic, gleeful, and eager to adopt any new theory 
    or conspiracy as the absolute truth. The Blog would be Sherman from 
    ""Peabody's Improbable History"" -- a traveler of time and space in search of 
    beauty, truth, and the outre. I think Jethro bOING bOING and Sherman Boing 
    Boing would be great pals. Jethro would invite Sherman's dog, Mr. Peabody, 
    to go raccoon hunting with him, and Sherman would send Jethro 40 years into 
    the future to hang out at the Playboy Mansion.  Link[1] Discuss[2][1] http://www.octapod.org/jeanpoole/archives/000203.html#000203

typo)? And what do you mean by ""unbreakable""?You need to be far more explicit about the problem which you wish to
solve, and about the constraints involved.Some general points:1. For a conventional ""CD key"" system, where the actual CDs are
mass-produced (where you have many identical CDs), and the entire
system has to work offline, you cannot solve the problem of valid keys
being ""traded"" (e.g. included along with bootleg copies of the
product).If there's an online element involved, you can ""tie"" keys to a
specific hardware configuration, as is done (AFAIK) for Windows XP's
""product activation"".2. Anything which uses a symmetric cipher (or hash) is bound to be
vulnerable to reverse engineering of the validation routines within
the executable.3. Ultimately, any software mechanism will be vulnerable to
""cracking"", i.e. modifying the software to disable or circumvent the
validation checks.This can only be prevented by the use of trusted hardware (e.g. a
Palladium-style system).Most significantly, the data must be supplied in a form which is only
accessible by that hardware. If anyone can get at the data in a
meaningful (i.e. unencrypted) form, they can extract the useful parts
and discard the rest (i.e. any associated protection mechanisms).IOW, you have to ""keep the genie in the bottle"" at all times. If the
data can be got at just once (even if it requires the use of dedicated
hardware such as a bus analyser), it can then be duplicated and
distributed without limit.--

"2 things - first, the switch parser changed in a subtle way with 8.4 -
byte-code compilation was added, and it is slightly more strict in
its parsing than the original parser.  You can only have a comment where
Tcl would expect to find a command.  Switch has a ""pattern - body""
strucutre, so if you goof and put a comment where it is trying to find
a pattern, both of you will be confused with the results.  The
subtlty arises with extra whitespace and newlines. I can't give you
the exact case, but I know exmh had one example that stopped parsing
correctly, and was arguably wrong before.2nd - I've managed to remain fairly ignoranat of the PGP support in
exmh, so you'll have to dig in yourself or see if someone else on
exmh-users or exmh-workers is having similar problems.>>>Reg Clemens said:

' s shares have fallen 26 percent in the past three days on concern the biggest energy trader ' s dealings with partnerships run by its chief financial officer contributed to investment losses . enron ' s stock dropped 10 percent today . enron ' s board cost the company at least $ 35 million by allowing chief financial officer andrew fastow to manage ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , partnerships that bought enron assets , a shareholder alleged wednesday in a lawsuit . the lawsuit came the day after enron reported $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses from failed investments . the wall street journal reported $ 35 million of the losses were connected with the two limited partnerships . enron also reduced shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from the partnerships , the paper reported yesterday . ` ` it looks sleazy , ' ' said roger hamilton , a manager at john hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 shares . ` ` if you are someone who invests in a company ' s management , it ' s almost time to punt with enron . ' ' enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t return calls or written requests seeking comment . fastow didn ' t immediately return a telephone call for comment . fastow and a handful of associates made more than $ 7 million last year in management fees and about $ 4 million in capital increases on an investment of about $ 3 million in one of the partnerships , the journal reported today . buying enron assets fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies and partnerships that appear to have ties to houston - based enron , based on filings with the texas secretary of state . the foreign business corporations and limited liability companies have directors , officers or managers whose address is listed as 1400 smith street in houston , enron ' s corporate address , according to texas records . fastow is listed as a director , officer or managing member in each one . at least one of the companies bought and sold enron assets , including foreign power plants . whitewing management , which lists fastow as its managing member , received $ 807 million from the sale of enron debt last year . under the terms of the debt sale , whitewing is allowed to use the proceeds to buy power plants from enron or make other ` ` permitted investments . ' ' whitewing has bought 14 enron plants or companies since 1999 and sold four . enron ' s denne has not responded to written requests about fastow ' s role at whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of the value of enron assets to benefit outside investors or company executives at enron ' s expense . shares of enron fell $ 2 . 95 to $ 26 . 05 . they have fallen 69 percent this year . - - russell hubbard in the princeton newsroom , 609 - 750 - 4651 or rhubbard 2 @ bloomberg . net , and jim kennett in houston , ( 713 ) 353 - 4871 or jkennett @ bloomberg . net / pjm / alp / pjm usa : update 1 - enron stock sustains further heavy losses . 10 / 19 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . ( new first paragraph , adds additional analyst comment ) by andrew kelly houston , oct 19 ( reuters ) - enron corp . stock sustained further heavy losses on friday as investor confidence in the former wall street favorite was rocked by reports about the company ' s relationship with a limited partnership that was run until recently by enron ' s chief financial officer . the energy giant ' s stock closed down $ 2 . 95 or 10 . 2 percent at $ 26 . 05 per share , making a cumulative loss of 27 percent for a week in which enron reported a third - quarter loss of $ 638 million , its first quarterly loss in over four years . analysts said confidence was shaken by several articles in the wall street journal this week alleging possible conflicts of interest on the part of chief financial officer andrew fastow , who until recently ran a limited partnership that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from enron . "" i don ' t think this thing passes the smell test , "" said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity . "" i think the cfo should be out of there right now . in the interest of the stockholders , that cfo should be gone , "" he said . enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements , but fastow severed his ties with the ljm 2 partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities . poor judgment ? analysts said that at the very least , the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at enron , which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of high - profile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer jeff skilling in august . "" for a company that had a lot of question marks around it already , these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors , "" said commerzbank securities analyst andre meade . "" it points to poor decision - making on behalf of the board and top management at enron , "" he said . enron , north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity , was one of wall street ' s high flyers last year , when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent . the stock ' s ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company ' s plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its enrononline internet energy trading platform . this year enron ' s shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadband and the internet soured , skilling resigned after only six months as ceo , and the company ' s dabhol power plant project in india became mired in a payments dispute . moody ' s investors service said earlier this week that it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after enron took $ 1 . 01 billion in write - downs and charges that substantially reduced valuations for several non - core businesses , including broadband and water services . some of enron ' s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings . analysts said enron ' s credibility has been severely damaged and the recent reports about the ljm 2 partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant surprises may lie ahead . "" what don ' t we know that went on at that company ? where ' s the credibility ? "" asked one frustrated analyst .

"" good people can always be placed . as long as there is a job to fill and the company has a budget to hire , "" sarah gilley of london - based recruitment group exchange consulting said . "" where the situation starts to get difficult is where everyone is cutting budgets , people are not being replaced when they leave and there have been an awful lot of redundancies . "" last week , scotiamocatta , a subsidiary of the bank of nova scotia and a key ring dealing member , unveiled its decision to give up open outcry trading on the lme floor , prompting around 25 job losses among traders , phone jockeys and clerks . then blue - blooded banker n . m . rothschild & sons closed its london and new york base metals units . it left its core precious metals business intact , but 20 base metals staff were laid off in the process . in the same week , the lme ' s largest floor trader , enron metals , said it planned to cut 10 to 20 percent of its metals staff as part of an exercise to cut 250 to 500 jobs in the enron group . security with three big market players and several major banks with commodities divisions slashing jobs at the same time , competition in the labour market will intensify and those in work are becoming wary about job security . "" what we ' re finding at the moment is that there is still demand for traders with a track record , which is possibly increasing because people are nervous about their jobs and so they ' re keen to stay put , "" gilley said . "" so whereas someone who might be a big money - spinner with a track record would have previously stayed in their job for two to three years , they are now staying for three to five years . "" they probably feel that they ' re reasonably safe where they are , they ' re well recognised and not going to stick their necks out , "" she said . bonus fears october has never traditionally been a strong month for the the jobs market in base metals as players are often distracted by lme week functions and conferences also , traders tend to be looking towards their annual performance - linked bonuses , which are usually announced at the end of the year . "" those who are in work at the moment are sticking . often at this time of year , people are hanging on for their bonuses . but i don ' t think any of them are anticipating good bonuses . they ' re probably just happy to have a job , "" sian griffiths of exchange consulting said . lme volumes traded have been fallen over the past 18 months as the powerful hedge funds that once took a shine to the metals swarmed into areas such as hi - tech and telecomms stocks . metals traders who handled the large volume of fund activity have begun to focus again on moree traditional clients , and this may yet prove a boon for the jobs market . companies are seeking to fill a shortage of staff schooled in the traditional practices of trading physical metal . "" a lot of companies who had sidelined the traditional physical business are now re - aligning their focus and need poeple who understand the physical market and know how to set up a hedge and manage it , "" gilley said . "" the other area where demand has markedly increased in comparison to a few years ago is marketing , "" she added . as for morale in the industry , individuals ' confidence in their future is seemingly undimmed .

"Once upon a time, Ralf wrote :> Are there any reasons _not_ to use the new apt releases on RH 7.x?Hmmm... I don't see any :-)My main concern is that when rebuilding the recent packages I've made for
Psyche on Valhalla, I'd need to lower the ""Release:"" tag (to keep an
upgrade working), and that would f*ck up my CVS repository which is on my
Valhalla box (well, I'm exagerating, It'll just make it more difficult for

Sure, there are easy ways around this, but the easiest for me will be to

What about the ""dvdrecord"" package that's already included in 7.3? It
doesn't do what this one does? I'm asking this because I've got a friend
with an iMac running YellowDog Linux (basically Red Hat Linux for PPC), and
it's one of the newer versions with a DVD burner. I'd be very interested in
using his drive to burn DVDs full of 2-CDs movies or full of ""files for

Also, a bootable DVD of Red Hat Linux 7.3 would be great as I've still not
burned the CDs even once for myself since I always install through the
network (and haven't found an easy way of purchasing an english boxed set
here in Spain...).Matthias--

"NFS as a protocol is not known for its speediness but this is absurd. I did an 
NFS install of a box this morning (that would be the box which won't boot 
from CD for those who were in IRC) and it was rather slow but I just left it 
to it. Having got it up, I want to copy the DVD to a disk on it so I have it 
handy for installing any further bits I might require. So I simply mounted 
the NFS exported DVD on the new box and started copying. After a couple of minutes I looked - it was transferring about 8MB a MINUTE. 
So I killed that and used rsync instead which is ticking away now at about 
100 MB/min - still not exactly turbo charged but a lot better than the NFS 
rate. Any ideas as to what's making it SO slow ? There's really no point in 
running more nfsd processes, as there is exactly one client, so I'm a little 
at a loss I must say.Niall--

Date: Thu, 26 Sep 2002 00:18:04 GMT""rssflowersalignright""A productive thread[1] on RSS-DEV confronts the 
negativeness about RSS 2.0[2] head-on. This will go someplace interesting.  I left a big hint there in the way the blogChannel module[3] is designed, 
patterned after the Syndication module[4] designed by the RDF folk. In other 
words, the place where they're expressing discomfort with RSS 2.0 is where they 
can make it their own. Lead. Instead of feeling disempowered, be powerful.  At one point I saw clearly where the compromise between RSS 0.9x and 1.0 was. 
We could have gotten there in early 2001, so instead we get there in late 2002. 
So what, not a big deal. Think about how much better it will be _when we're all 
advocating the same format._ Visualize peace. That's basically what I did when 
I did the 2.0 spec. I know it's hard to swallow, but swallow anyway. If I did

diary.codemonkey.org.uk [Dave Jones]:
 Got a mail from Neil telling me about some whizzy new warnings in the cvs 
version of gcc. Pulled it and spent a while playing with gcc, and after a 
few false starts got it to spit out a bunch of warnings when compiling the 
kernel. There's a boatload of stuff that still needs cleaning up for 2.5 
(Things like __FUNCTION__ abuse and the like). 2.4 doesn't even compile due 
to broken asm constraints and other such sillies. As 3.x isn't a recommended 
compiler for 2.4, this isn't too important just yet. As more and more archs 
start using 3.x for their standard compiler though, we should clean up some 
of this stuff for 2.5. The new warning Neil tipped me off about 
(-Wunused-macros) turns out far too much crap. From what I looked at, 
it was correct in most cases, and yes there were macros being defined 
but being unused. Cleaning them up however creates a maintenance nightmare 
for anyone with patches in those areas already. (This sort of cleanup 
particularly hurts people like myself who have huge patches touching large 
parts of the tree). The recent gcc->c99 struct initialisers patch for instance 
made large parts of my tree reject. With more to come, the fun isn't over yet either.that is the CVS version, but it seems that more breakage is to come with the
kernel :((Everyone will want to compile their machine on the latest greatest... I think
they eventually persuaded Compaq's compiler to compile the kernel)...L.

"Quite independently from testing and tuning the algorithm, I'd like to
think about deployment.Eventually, individuals and postmasters should be able to download a
spambayes software distribution, answer a few configuration questions
about their mail setup, training and false positives, and install it
as a filter.A more modest initial goal might be the production of a tool that can
easily be used by individuals (since we're more likely to find
individuals willing to risk this than postmasters).There are many ways to do this.  Some ideas:- A program that acts both as a pop client and a pop server.  You
  configure it by telling it about your real pop servers.  You then
  point your mail reader to the pop server at localhost.  When it
  receives a connection, it connects to the remote pop servers, reads

 Release Date: 2002/07/22
Last Modified: 2002/07/22
       Author: Stefan Esser [s.esser@e-matters.de]  Application: PHP 4.2.0, 4.2.1
     Severity: A vulnerability within the multipart/form-data handler
               could allow remote compromise of the web server.
         Risk: Critical
Vendor Status: Patches Released.
    Reference: http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/022002.htmlOverview:
	
   We have discovered a serious vulnerability within the default version 
   of PHP. Depending on the processor architecture it may be possible for a 
   remote attacker to either crash or compromise the web server. 
 
	
Details:   PHP 4.2.0 introduced a completely rewritten multipart/form-data POST 
   handler. While I was working on the code in my role as PHP developer
   i found a bug within the way the mime headers are processed. 
   A malformed POST request can trigger an error condition, that is not
   correctly handled. Due to this bug it could happen that an uninit-
   ialised struct gets appended to the linked list of mime headers.
   When the lists gets cleaned or destroyed PHP tries to free the pointers
   that are expected in the struct. Because of the lack of initialisation
   those pointers contain stuff that was left on the stack by previous
   function calls.    On the IA32 architecture (aka. x86) it is not possible to control what
   will end up in the uninitialised struct because of the stack layout. All 
   possible code paths leave illegal addresses within the struct and PHP
   will crash when it tries to free them.   Unfortunately the situation is absolutely different if you look on a
   solaris sparc installation. Here it is possible for an attacker to free
   chunks of memory that are full under his control. This is most probably
   the case for several more non IA32 architectures.   Please note that exploitability is not only limited to systems that are
   running malloc()/free() implementations that are known to be vulnerable
   to control structure overwrites. This is because the internal PHP memory
   managment implements its own linked list system that can be used to
   overwrite nearly arbitrary memory addresses.
   Proof of Concept:   e-matters is not going to release the exploit for this vulnerability to
   the public.
   Vendor Response:   22th July 2002 - An updated version of PHP which fixes this 
                    vulnerability was released and can be downloaded at:                       http://www.php.net/downloads.php                    The vendor announcement is available at:                       http://www.php.net/release_4_2_2.php
Recommendation:   If you are running PHP 4.2.x you should upgrade as soon as possible,
   especially if your server runs on a non IA32 CPU. If you cannot upgrade
   for whatever reason the only way to workaround this, is to disable all
   kinds of POST requests on your server.

[...]All of these ""af6"" are related to avifile6 support :-/
Normally, my 0.6.1-fr2 build of transcode defaults to *not* use avifile,
but you can use ""--with avifile6"" to force recompiling against it.Do you have an old avifile installed maybe?
Can you check the ""./configure ..."" line run at the beginning of the
rebuild process to see if it does include the ""--without-avifile6"" option?Matthias--

"I think that when considering deployment, a solution that supports all
Python platforms and not just the L|Unix crowd is desirable.Mac and PC users are more apt to be using a commercial MUA that's unlikely
to offer hooking ability (at least not easily). As mentioned elsewhere, even
L|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to
their MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).)My notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, a
client-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I'm only
going to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams
the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). The
MUA accesses this ""eThunk"" as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam is
retained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual
oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter)
and the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUA
fetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for 'always online' users, but I am not
clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme.Outbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully all
MUAs can split the host fetch/send URL'sIMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. If
this is available, the ""simple viewer"" could be enhanced to support viewing
via folders and (at least for me) the Outlook nightmare is over - I would
use this as my only MUA. (N.B. according to my recent readings, the best
n-way classifier uses something called a ""Support Vector Machine"" (SVM)
which is 5-8% more accurate then Naive Bayes (NB) ).I wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves
the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code? That way, it could
be dropped into whatever harness that suited the user's situation.David LeBlanc

browsing the ippe via mosaic ( or any other web browser ) is now the preferred access method . mosaic and other web browsers allow easy access to the multiple formats in which the ippe stores each paper , allowing users to as easily browse an abstract or an ascii version of a paper online as to download or print a fully-formatted version . in addition , we have provided navigation aids such as a colorful graphical map of the ippe ( not to mention the attractive new graphical ippe logo ) . in addition , much of the ippe 's structure , and many of our informational documents , are being redesigned to take full advantage of the hypertext capabilities of the web . expect further announcements soon . in ncsa mosaic , netscape , lynx , or your www browser of choice , open the url http : / / phil-preprints . l . chiba-u . ac . jp / ippe . html to pay us a visit . new journals online since the last "" news from the ippe "" in july , several more journals have joined our program of making pre-press abstracts , tables of contents , and in some cases selected full-text articles available online . recent additions include ethics and the journal of the history of philosophy , and arrangements are currently being made with five other journals , bringing the total number of journals available or soon to be available through the ippe to over a dozen . we invite the editors of other journals to contact us at the address given below . call for submissions the ippe invites the submission of working papers in all areas of philosophy . submissions undergo an informal process of "" minimal refereeing "" by the ippe 's international board to ensure that they are of contemporary philosophical interest , but need not be in fully publishable condition as they stand . due to the flexibility of our electronic media , no length limits apply . the ippe 's large collection of working papers is currently being visited by over 1000 philosophers and graduate students each month , providing the widest possible exposure for works in progress . authors benefit from the critical attention of colleagues world-wide . many authors have received incisive commentaries and forged important international connectins with workers in their areas , and the exposure produced by placing a paper on the ippe has also in a number of cases yielded tangible benefits including speaking invitations and offers of publication . copyright to a paper placed on the the ippe remains with the author , and therefore placing a paper on the ippe is no obstacle to subsequent publication . placing a working draft on the ippe provides an ideal way to beenfit from the critical attention of the international philiophical community before submitting a work for publication . call for commentaries the ippe invites the submission of well-reasoned commentaries on any working paper currently available on the ippe . commentaries are subject to the same "" minimal refereeing "" process described above for working papers . accepted commentaries are made available on the ippe alongside the original papers to which they apply , and the authors of the original papers are invited to respond in similar form . ippe represented at psa / 4s / hsa meeting the round table on electronic communications at october 's joint meeting of the psa , 4s , and hsa provided an opportunity for members of the ippe 's board to meet with representatives of several other leading projects in electronic media for philosophy and science studies . among the topics discussed were means of lowering the technological barriers to access to electronic communications resources , and especially to the submission of materials , and the formation of a consortium or clearinghouse for electronic publishers in these fields . much was accomplished , and even greater possibilities lie ahead . renovations nearly complete the international philosophical preprint exchange 's ambitious project to create an integrated system allowing the preprints and other documents on the ippe to be distributed simultaneously by means of the world wide web in addition to the previously implemented gopher , ftp , and mail-server access methods is nearly complete . the customized software we have developed for this purpose allows the ippe staff to easily make a single copy of a working paper available

"re : "" snow "" 1 / 2 about snow . . . first , i should apologize to tony for misunderstanding his cocktail advice - - his derivation of the origins of my misunderstanding is correct . second , i think that quotations from boas / whorf are very helpful and a good reminder to those of us in this debate . third , as to the question of whether or not sleet is related to snow . i do n't agree . it is , i agree , related ( and would be defined in relation to ) water , but ( at least i and a few other students that i asked ) would n't define it as a form of snow ( ditto for freezing rain ) . fourth , i agree with tony that "" counting "" has to be mediated by many considerations of grammatical structure in the compared languages and spread of the form in the speech community . but , i do n't think that this wipes out the ( admittedly small , but original ) point . fifth , i ' m going to sidestep the issue over ' lexicalization ' vs . ' complex construction ' because i do n't think that i share the same view as others on the importance / necessity of this distinction - - indeed , it is a bit ironic that another implication of sapir / whorf is that the view that our language is made up out of ' words ' and ' grammar ' ( constructions ) is precisely the kind of objectification , which we would expect and which formal distributional analyses show to be a simplification ) . as jonathan states , "" figuring out just what counts as a simple , lexicalised form is * very * hard in yup ' ik , given that it has a rich , higly productive derivational morphology "" . i agree and the answer would eventually have to draw lines along continua that i do n't think will be labelled ' lexical ' vs . ' construct ' ( and sapir offered some nice theoretical machinery for these kinds of comparative distinctions too ) . i still see only four ' arbitrary and unmotivated ' forms that deal specifically with 's now ' ( i . e . , snow , slush , blizzard , flurry ) . i ' ll leave it to others to decide whether or not various dialects of eskimo have more or less , but even if the point should fail here it still has life to it . so , i still find myself agreeing with the original insight . the point - - and not all that it has been used to argue - - has always seemed obvious to me . perhaps if we narrow the scope of the relevant speech community and bring it closer to home , it is easier to see . would n't we all accept the idea that _ on average _ lawyers ( vs . non-lawyers ) have more distinct forms for legal concepts than do others outside this community / culture ? ( and , of course , what we mean by distinct forms implies all of the complex relative distinctions hinted at above ) . similarly to take an example i know more about , statistically speaking arabs have more arbitrary and unmotivated forms for camels than english speakers ( even accounting for differences in the syntactico-semantic structures of the two languages ) . why does this simple - - and to be honest relatively uninteresting - - idea seem to bother people so much ? douglas j . glick department of anthropology vassar college doglick @ vassar . edu",Safe Email

"fw : northeast rto mediation report fyi - - - - - original message - - - - - from : novosel , sarah sent : tuesday , september 18 , 2001 8 : 36 am to : kean , steven j . ; shapiro , richard ; steffes , james d . ; nicolay , christi l . ; lindberg , susan ; robertson , linda ; fulton , donna ; alvarez , ray ; connor , joe ; staines , dan ; stroup , kerry ; migden , janine ; walton , steve ; comnes , alan ; mara , susan ; maurer , luiz ; philipp , meredith cc : allegretti , daniel ; hoatson , tom ; fromer , howard subject : northeast rto mediation report yesterday afternoon , september 17 , the judge in the northeast rto mediation proceeding issued his report to the commission on the 45 - day mediation session . although not unexpected , but still disappointing , the judge endorses the market design proposal of the new york and new england isos . this market design proposal encompasses a long , drawn out process for discussing what the northeast market should look like ( minimum 12 months ) before work begins to develop the new rto . the target implementation date of the isos is november , 2004 , but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is "" subject to extension "" if new design requirements are introduced . we believe the true intent of the isos is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing iso structures . a copy of the judge ' s report and the business plan are attached . one good aspect of the judge ' s report is that he asks in several areas of the report for commission guidance . we too believe this is necessary . it became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the new york entities ( or the new england iso ) on market design or governance . we argued that ferc intended the new market design to be primarily the pjm system , with enhancements where possible . others , relying on the ambiguity in ferc ' s orders , argued that ferc really intended to create a new system , using pjm as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two isos , regardless of time or complication of creating this new market . we need ferc direction on this , and the judge makes this clear . background the judge ' s primary goal of this 45 - day mediation process was simply to establish a "" business plan "" which lays out how and when a single northeast rto will be created . enron , along with many other participants , opposed this approach , arguing that we are wasting the 45 days given to us by the commission . the judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly . although the majority of the judge ' s report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan , he does discuss two substantive issues : market design and governance . market design at the beginning of the mediation , pjm , ny and ne submitted a joint proposal for forming a single northeast rto . this proposal envisions a time - intensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders , with an implementation date in 3 - 4 years ( "" option 1 - m "" of the business plan ) . this proposal is now supported by the new england and new york isos - pjm has its own approach ( see below ) . the new york transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new rto in 3 years ( "" option 2 - m "" of the business plan ) . pjm submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single northeast rto with a single day - ahead and real - time energy market by november 2003 ( "" option 3 - m "" of the business plan ) . we took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers , generators , pjm tos , industrials , and other end use customers ( the one rto coalition ) advocating the creation of a single energy market based on pjm ' s system by december 2002 , but no later than may , 2003 . although we ( enron ) believe pjm ' s november 2003 time frame is too conservative , the coalition supports option 3 - m ( pjm ' s approach ) since it achieves the coalition ' s goals , albeit on a slower timetable . as noted above , the judge endorses option 1 - m , in part because it has a built - in a process for determining "" best practices . "" although pjm also conducted a "" best practices "" analysis , the other isos and ny tos do not agree with pjm ' s determinations of what practices from their isos are "" best practices . "" the judge acknowledges that support for option 3 - m ( the pjm plan ) "" far outstrips "" the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support . however , the judge believes that the pjm option assumes the pjm platform can work in new york and new england , even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in new york and new england than in pjm . the judge states that "" impatience , haste and greed "" should not be permitted to drive the rto process "" at the expense of sound policy "" and that optimal rto benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to "" exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint . "" see report , page 18 . governance the other substantive issues we have discussed are governance : interim governance , final governance , board make - up and stakeholder process . the judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead , he discusses the pros and cons of each option . here again , the judge strongly urges the commission to provide guidance to the participants on the commission ' s preferred governance approach . the judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures . pjm has stated that in order to meet its deadline of november 2003 ( and certainly earlier ) , pjm has to be in control of the implementation of the new rto . pjm proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing isos : 5 from pjm , 3 from new york , and 2 from new england . the board elects a voting ceo ( assumed to be phil harris if the pjm proposal wins ) . ny iso , new england iso , ny psc , ny tos and new england tos , along with other entities ( primarily those who are afraid to cross new york psc ) all support equal representation on the new board . one proposal would have 3 board members from each iso with a non - voting ceo . the other proposal would have 3 board members from each iso with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders . we support the pjm board make - up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single northeast rto and energy market based on the pjm system . post mediation the judge in his report recommends that the commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge . the judge urges the commission to not accept comments from participants , but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment . we are working on two sets of comments now , one on our own and one in conjunction with the one rto coalition . we will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared . although we are disappointed that the judge did not endorse the pjm proposal , we still believe that the commission is intent on implementing a single northeast rto as soon as possible and that the pjm proposal provides a well - reasoned ( even conservative ) approach to reaching that goal . therefore , even though the judge sided with new york , we are hopeful that the commission will stick to its guns and go with the pjm proposal . please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the report . sarah , dan , howard and tom",Safe Email

Date: 2002-10-07T21:35:22-06:00Yahoo: The Case for Regime Change[1].        Khatami asked the U.N. to set a deadline for Bush to step down in favor of 
    president-in-exile Al Gore the legitimate winner of the 2000 election, the 
    results of which were subverted through widespread voting irregularities 
    and intimidation.      [... This will likely require] a prolonged bombing campaign targeting major 
    U.S. cities and military installations, followed by a ground invasion led 
    by European forces. ""Civilian casualties would likely be substantial,"" said 
    a French military analyst. ""But the American people must be liberated from 
    tyranny.""     [...] ""Even before Bush, the American political system was a shambles,"" 
    said Prof. Salvatore Deluna of the University of Madrid. ""Their 
    single-party plutocracy will have to be reshaped into true 
    parliamentary-style democracy. Moreover, the economy will have to be 
    retooled from its current military dictatorship model--in which a third of 
    the federal budget goes to arms, and taxes are paid almost exclusively by 
    the working class--to one in which basic human needs such as education and 
    poverty are addressed. Their infrastructure is a mess; they don't even have 
    a national passenger train system. Fixing a failed state of this size will 
    require many years.""    Welcome news. The only way to crush America's fundamentalist tendencies is by

"Surely it would be faster to save you conf files, install it on the box
again, copy back you confs and voila.
All you car about are the confs as the boite has no DATA right?Thats what I would do, but you sysadmins have to make life as difficult &
complicated as possible ;--)Have you thought about mirroring the system drives? Might save you serious
hassle down the line. Only kidding but thats what I would do.CW----------------
OK, Here's how to do it [1] ...While the disk is still installed in the i686 machine (if that's broken,
beg, borrow or steal...), remove the i686 versions of glibc and kernel and
install the i386 versions.  This will break one or two other packages since
they have entries in /etc/ld.so.conf which belongs to glibc.  these packages
will need to be reinstalled.  So:1. rpm -e --nodeps glibc	Your /etc/ld.so.conf has been saved as /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave2. rpm -ivh glibc--i386.rpm
3. rpm -e --nodeps kernel
4. rpm -ivh kernel--i386.rpmThis installs the i386 versions of kernel and glibc.  You'll be able to boot
in a non 686 machine now.  However, X is now broken as is kerberos.  At
least those are the two I noticed.  Your /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave will
contain clues as to what else might be broken.  To fix X and kerberos you
need to reinstall their libs (copying /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave back to
/etc/ld.so.conf doesn't seem to work):1. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs XFree86-libs--i386.rpm
2. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs krb5-libs--i386.rpmfixes them.  Other libs listed in _my_ /etc/ld.so.conf are qt, mysql and
sane.  If they start behaving in odd fashions, it may be related.
Reinstalling the libs for these packages may fix that.Thanks guys...> [snip]

admin will be done locally.Conor[1] ""it"" being migrate a Hard Disk from an Intel P3/4/celeron box to an AMD
K6-x box.  Essentially, the P3/4/celeron processor is an i686 class while
the AMD K6 processor is an i586 class (not sure about the AMD athlon or
duron chips).  A RHL installed on the i686 class machine will not boot on an
i586 calss box since both kernel and glibc are optimised for i686.  The
solution is to replace the i686 kernel and glibc with i386 versions.

"disc : the parameter of aspect "" on the parameter of aspect "" this posting continues the fruitful exchange subsequent to the initial book review of c . smith 's 1991 "" the parameter of aspect "" . in a follow-up to that review , i noted an alternative to smith 's proposal involving a simpler binary parameter for aspect that was in part the basis for my 1995 dissertation on the biblical hebrew verbal system ( u of toronto ) . smith 's reply pointed out the apparent empirical disconfirmation by mandarin and navajo ( treated in her work among others ) ; and this is where we pick up the thread . i do not grant the traditional analysis of navajo and especially mandarin chinese that is the basis of the objection ; nor do i grant the traditional analysis of the "" oriental "" languages including burmese , japanese , and above all , biblical hebrew representing the classical semitic systems . the earliest layer of the quasi-consensus on tense , mood and aspect ( tma ) , flowing from comrie 1976 , 1985 to present , is the early 19th century "" orientalist "" framework that posits ( a ) "" tenseless "" languages or "" inflectional aspect "" systems , and ( b ) a definition of "" perfectivity "" based on the ambiguity inherent in the concept of "" completion "" ( global view as well as relative past tense ) ; on "" oriental "" and "" orientalism "" , see e . g . , e . said 's "" orientalism "" 1978 . i reject the orientalist framework and the analysis of semitic systems which was extended to other "" oriental "" systems , which was extended worldwide to at least half of the world 's systems ; i indirectly reject the traditional analysis of mandarin and navajo . to clarify and make the discussion more concrete , i offer an analysis of english in the orientalist framework ( * please * do not take this seriously as an analysis of english ) . english , as all reputable authorities agree , is "" tenseless "" : it encodes only "" aspect "" ( cf . slavic systems ) . not only do we find arrested development , but actual regression from the robust classical aryan tma systems . english has but one distinction : - ed vs - s / - 0 , respectively perfective and imperfective . the perfective signals "" completion "" vs the non-completion of the imperfective . the severely impoverished system of english signals the regression of the anglo - american mind ( witness reagan and thatcher , etc . , etc . ) . we note several key elements that underlie all traditional analyses of so-called "" tenseless "" languages . 1 ) tma is encoded morphologically on the greek model or not at all : the "" morphocentric fallacy . "" 2 ) the perfective is defined as relative past tense ( bypassing the revolution in aspectology in the second half of the 1800s ) : the "" aorist fallacy . "" 3 ) the relative hierarchy of languages , with greek and sanskrit on top , semitic near the bottom , and now the creoles on the bottom , related to the relative development of "" mind "" and tied to a particular pre - darwinian interpretation of evolutionary theory . english is not tenseless , nor is biblical hebrew or quranic arabic , nor is japanese , nor burmese , nor turkish , nor indeed mohawk or haitian creole . they do differ from the standard european systems : they systematically differ with respect to aspect in mirror-image fashion . this difference is insightfully captured by cowper 's strong claim for a simple binary parameter for aspect : a system default 's for an aspectual interpretation of its simple tense system , either perfective or non-perfective . the aspect not "" defaulted for "" is separately encoded ( cross-linguistically in a limited number of ways ) . european "" tense "" systems default for the non-perfective ( apparently the minority or marked option ) ; non - european "" tenseless "" systems default for the perfective as does english . i simply extrapolate to a strong claim for universal grammar : all systems encode tense ( past vs non-past ; i do not grant a "" future tense "" ) , and at least irrealis / realis ; and in addition the basic system is configured by the binary parameter for aspect . virtually all systems outside of the european sphere default for the perfective according to my studies ; and i assume that is the unmarked setting for ug . the major diagnostic among many is the ( non - ) obligatory expression of the progressive : the perfective default must separately encode the progressive . e . g . , mandarin must express the progressive by the zai v construction ( lit .

*Q AND A SECTION**SHIVER MY TIMBERS*/From Tad Spencer/: ""Please could you tell me where the phrase /shiver 
my timbers/ originated?""This is one of those supposedly nautical expressions that seem to be 
better known through a couple of appearances in fiction than by any 
actual sailors' usage.It's an exclamation that may allude to a ship striking some rock or 
other obstacle so hard that her timbers shiver, or shake, so implying a 
calamity has occurred. It is first recorded as being used by Captain 
Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: ""I won't thrash you Tom. 
Shiver my timbers if I do"".It has gained a firm place in the language because almost fifty years 
later Robert Louis Stevenson found it to be just the kind of old-salt 
saying that fitted the character of Long John Silver in /Treasure 
Island/: ""Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before 
you ... some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, 
and all to feed the fishes"". Since then, it's mainly been the preserve 
of second-rate seafaring yarns.",Safe Email
"I like this part - sounds like httpd on the client...http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/04/27/xdegrees.html""Once the Client Component is installed, a server can order a program to run
on the client. Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could be
run on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts.
Originally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the field
started demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGI
and mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose to
go back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let the
client do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in one
important detail: the program doesn't have to reload when a new page is
loaded, as JavaScript functions do.And because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can access
XDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using their
browser.""===
""Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a
new naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figured
out mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and
billions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location of
servers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamai
does), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default
""home"" server. Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-house
applications.""""Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the
Internet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees is
more sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth
connections can download portions, or ""stripes,"" of a file from several
cached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassembles
these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that
the downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of this
digital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP header
for the file.""

"I've got some really interesting wav files here.A friend had a Windows CD with, wait for it . . .Every Beatles Record ever released in the U.K.! Including the Christmas and 
BBC special albums! All on one, ordinary CD! Yes a 650M CD!Of course this CD also had a special Windows app for playing this collection!I had a look at the contents of the CD, since I don't do Windows, and the 
albums appeared to be plain wav files? Each album in it's own wav file, 25 
Albums, 25 wav files?!? I copied the wav files to my hard drive. Curious thing, though, noatun crashes on some of the larger ones, seems to 
attempt to load the entire file into memory first, and on the ones it doesn't 
crash on, it plays them fast and noisily? kwave refuses to recognise them 
completely and wavp just makes an ungodly noise!xanim can, and does play them correctly though. Unfortunately xanim does not 
have any position control so you just have to listen to the album from start 
to finish.file has this to say about them:johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ file beatles/SGT.WAV
beatles/SGT.WAV: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft ADPCM, 
stereo 22050 Hz

-r-xr-xr-x    1 johngay  johngay  53334900 Sep 27  2001 beatles/SGT.WAVAnd this is SGT Pepper's lonely Hearts Club Band album. 51M is quite good, 
considering it also has the inner track. But they certainly are NOT in stereo.What I would like to do is split up the tracks and convert them the mp3 for 
xmms. I'm jsut not sure what tools would be able to handle these strange 
compressed wav's that only xanim seems to recognise? I like the albums, but 
would prefer to be able to sellect tracks to play rather than entire albums 
and be able to listen to all my music with one app. I know xmms has a WAV 
plugin, but it does not recognise these either.Any help will be greatly appreciated!Cheers,	John Gay

"n-ary comparison ( 1 ) very strongly support alexis mr 's message on n-ary comparison being stronger than binary comparison . as real minds work , it is the pragmatics of not going down false trails which is at issue . i am puzzled only by what he mentions as an exceptional case , that is , how ternary comparison could * * * ever * * * be worse than binary . even if a third language is included which is more divergent , has more loan vocabulary , or whatever , and therefore poses extra problems or barriers . that is not a consequence of the ternary status in the comparison , because if the same language were included as one member of a binary comparison , the same problems would presumably be there . ( 2 ) i did not respond earlier only because of lack of time . the preference for n-ary comparison , the claim that n-ary is only a multiple of binary , is obviously false , just as the notion that one should not be engaging in comparison if one needs to use a dictionary is obviously false ( alice faber answered that one , that if that restriction had been enforced , our knowledge would be far less than it now securely is ) . both of these supposed restrictions are for the convenience of the linguist analyst , artificially restricting the data available so as to make it seem as if the analyst 's knowledge is more complete for the task than it is , and give a greater ( but artificial ) sense of psychological security . it goes along with the statement by some historical linguists that they "" never want to make a mistake "" . of course none of us do , but some are willing to in order to advance knowledge , and even those who do not want to cannot make themselves immune . the very act of disregarding data which is "" too far afield "" can sometimes lead to mistakes . always possible when trying to * discover * answers when we do not know the answers in advance . rather , we are all human , and gigantic problems will be beyond any of us to completely solve ( attempts at partial solutions do not imply guilt or wrongdoing ) . this in no way implies we should not attempt to solve those problems . we should be tolerant of others ' efforts and use the best part of them , always .

custom pickler.  I just checked my little dbm file and found a lot of

  >>> d = hammie.PersistentGrahamBayes(""ham.db"")

  (WordInfo'(1031337979.16197, 0, 0, 0, 0.5)', 42)Ignoring the fact that there are too many zeros in there, the pickled
version of that WordInfo object is over twice as large as the string
representation.  So we could get a 50% decrease in size just by using
the string representation instead of the pickle, right?Something about that logic seems wrong to me, but I can't see what it
is.  Maybe pickling is good for heterogeneous data types, but every
value of our big dictionary is going to have the same type, so there's a
ton of redundancy.  I guess that explains why it compressed so well.Neale

Continuous
End-User testing, constructive feedback, and suggestions on how to improve
the
system.  Upgrade each time a new beta version comes out, so everyone is
testing
on the same version of the code, and old bugs don't get reported as being in
the
new version, thus slowing down the debugging process.Report any installation issues, bugs, errors, etc., to the V2 beta list
(http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-testers) so that they can
be quickly
looked at, etc.  Provide detailed description of issues, include logs if
possible,
as well as any ""captured"" spam that generated the error(s).

that.  The mere knowledge of known plaintext (a corresponding input and
output) does not necessarily make it trivial to break a properly
designed systems and/or algorithm. The primary reason it was easy for
CSS is because the CSS key was only 40-bits, and thereby easy to break
with exhaustive search attacks.  It was only 40-bits (speculated)
because of a misunderstanding of the government cryptography export
rules at the time.Even more interesting, to me at least, was that soon after the Xing
player break, people started studying the CSS algorithm itself.  They
rapidly found serious design flaws which left the 40-bit CSS algorithm
with an actual strength of around 23-bits (from memory, and new attacks
might have further reduced the strength).  This is another great example

There have been any number of very clever attacks against smartcards
(Ross Anderson in the UK has documented quite a few of these), and
smartcard manufactures are usually one step behind these attacks.  A
well designed system assumes that a system smartcard will be completely
compromised at some point, giving an adversary all of the secrets
contained in the smartcard.  The cryptography industry has developed a
variety of techniques that can reduce the impact of a compromise,
including unique keys per smartcard and forward security techniques.

outside the trusted hardware, it is impossible to ""unbreakably"" protect
it.  There may be some mitigation steps you can take, such as the SDMI
watermarking, but most schemes to date have been easily broken.  Another consideration is the value of what you are trying to protect.
While there is no such thing as unbreakable, adding more cost (both in
terms of price and hassle-factor) can greatly improve the protection.
Since you are talking about the use of standard PC workstations, I
presume what you are trying to protect is not THAT valuable.  I'm afraid
most security measures don't come for free.

"dash for potential deal with nstar all : as some of you may be aware , we appear to be getting close to entering a transaction with nstar to serve its all - requirements power needs for its residential and commercial customer class default service obligations . the deal would be for a term of 6 or 12 months commencing july 1 , 2001 . nstar ' s service territory covers boston and surrounds , as well as south - eastern massachusetts . this prospective deal is very similar in nature to the standard offer service deals we have entered into with united illuminating , nstar , and most recently , central maine power . here is the status at this point : nstar achieved various levels of signoff for the basic deal structure ( both with regulators and internal senior management ) . nstar has indicated that it has basically come down to price and they could potentially pull the trigger as early as monday , but certainly within a couple of days at the most . nstar has requested updated pricing by 10 am eastern on monday 3 / 26 to be held firm through cob same day ( contingent upon execution of definitive agreements by that time ) . they are seeking pricing updates from competing suppliers so we are not exclusive at this point . nstar / enron have worked through our extensive markups on their proposed contract , and have compiled a list of outstanding contract issues . ( note : marcus nettelton has been leading our legal efforts on this deal , and can be reached at 5 - 8161 to discuss contract issues ) . while the number of outstanding contract items are numerous at this point , my sense is that there are no real deal breakers on either their end or ours . in fact , they have agreed to many of the open issues in our previous contract with them for standard offer service , so they could potentially agree to our terms without much delay , thereby potentially making execution on monday a possibility . attached is a draft dash for this deal . i request that you review it promptly with a goal to have each of your signoffs for this deal in principle by mid - afternoon on monday so as to enable us to transact on monday if necessary . the parameters that are still in motion are : ( 1 ) price ( again to e updated monday morning ) , but will maintain same npv value ; ( 2 ) term ( they may end up just going for 6 months ) ; and ( 3 ) exact volume they source from us . as for volume , they indicated they may want to go with us for something less than 100 % of their requirements for the first 6 months ( they estimate anywhere between 50 - 100 % ) , and then potentially a smaller percentage for the second 6 months if they do end up doing a 12 - month deal . please feel free to call me ( 978 - 449 - 9936 office , 978 - 448 - 9260 home over the weekend ) if you would like to discuss in more detail . berney aucoin in structuring will be on point to run internal traps on monday as may be necessary . thanks in advance . regards john",Safe Email

Dear Sir.First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virture of its nature as being utterly confidencial and top secret. all though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, let me start by introducing myself properly to you.I am the Manager Bills and Exchange of Foreign Remittance Department of Union Bank of NIgeria (U.B.N. Headquarters Lagos Nigeria) formally Union Bank of Switzerland(UBS-AG Zurich Switzerland). In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.We discovered an abandoned sum of US$7. 5 million(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our Foreign customer who died along side his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.To this effect, I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.We need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and I. If you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter and putting in your BANK PARTICULARS, PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.Once I receive your reply, I will send you the Text of application for immediate application of Claim.Yours faithfully,DR MARKUS PHILLIPS.

i do believe that many traditions ( sexism being one of them ) and perspectives are partially conveyed through language . however , like you , i tend to believe that language and behavior evolve together . i do believe that historically today 's sexist interactive patterns are influenced - - among other factors - - by sociolinguistic practices during biblical times when a wife had to address her husband as slaves had to address their master , or subjects their king . this implied that a man could also address his wife as a master his slave and a king his subject , i . e . , using a clear rhetoric of authority . today , conversational dominance by males in our judeo-christian society is not as extreme as during the biblical times , but interestingly it is still inherent to male-specific discourse and has become the focus of some interesting sociolinguistic research . as a matter of fact , i moved to the bible belt one year ago ( i spent 10 years on the east and west coasts in the us prior to my arrival in the bible belt last year ; originally i come from europe ) , and after observations of interractive patterns among couples around me , i came to the hypothesis that the stronger a religious ( or traditional ) impact on people 's life , the more sex discrimination is reflected in language use . i have also noticed much more instances of sex discrimination in language use in offices i had to go to in the bible belt ( e . g . doctor and lawyer offices , insurance agencies , etc . ) than in other professional offices i visited elsewhere in the u . s . i found this extremely interesting . > ( a ) i do believe that people in all kinds of cultures themselves > believe that men and male behavior are superior in some sense to > women and female behavior , and i hold that this perception ( even if > it were not accurate ) is what must matter to us as we discuss > sexist language . whether the perception is accurate is of no importance > in this context . why should it be of no importance ? shall we just accept the discriminatory status quo as it is ? what is the point of studying linguistics if it is for no other purpose than the pleasure of intellectual analysis ? shall we just remain at the analytical level and ignore the implications revealed by research , or could we also use research findings to help improve communication or even change subsconsciously ( socially ) acquired schemata ? studies in psychology have shown that females reading texts written in a generic "" he "" retain less information than when they read texts using a generic plural . obviously , the impact of using a sexist language goes beyond the simple interest of linguistic studies within a certain context . personally , i like to believe that my research will somewhat help society at large . what is the point of considering discriminatory perspectives as unchangeable or questionable facts whereas we all know that both languages and human psychology have the potential to change ? > ( b ) i do not make any necessary connection between oppression of > womn and oppression of black people at all . i simply used the > example of black slavery as an example of the general principle that > to admit the existence of a form of oppression practiced by some > group ( by white people ) does not mean that one must necessarily > hate them . my point was that i am not a mysandrist just because > i accept that men have historically not been very nice to women . you are absolutely right ! hate does not help any purpose nor does it improve communication . yet , black people needed the cooperation of open-minded white people to help them reach a status based on the principle of equality . the same applies to females who keep trying to communicate with males , and who meet open and understanding men whereas others still believe that sexism is a nonsense political issue brought up by angry feminists . before being a political issue , it is a serious social issue that needs to be addressed through mutual understanding and respect . if males refuse their cooperation , some females may end up hating men as a natural psychological reaction . simone de beauvoir wrote in her book the second sex that there is no black problem yet a white problem ( referring the civil right movement in the us in the 50 's 60 's ) , because so called black issues essentially stem from the whites ' disciminatory attitudes . black problems can be addressed by first revealing the problem of racism , and then by educating people to open their mind to differences as an enriching asset to the society , not a sign of deficiency . likewise , women issues are primarily men issues , because we are still living in a world which has been historically organized by men who believed in female inferiority , whether politically , socially or linguistically . communication between men and women is therefore the key to social improvement , hence the social mission of our research in linguistics , considering that language use is a social phenomenon . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * je pense donc je baragouine . . . . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * lydie e . meunier / department of languages university of tulsa / tel : 918 631 2813 ( o ) lang _ lem @ centum . utulsa . edu / fax : 918 744 1902 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *",Safe Email

I think what you're looking at with the dual antenna mounts is a

 From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
      Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
      To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.--------------------------------------------------------------------
Shakespeare, William.  Sonnets.William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was a famous English poet,
dramatist, and actor, often regarded as the greatest English
writer of all time. Shakespeare's early life was spent in
Stratford-upon-Avon, where little else is known about him
until he married at age 18 to Anne Hathaway.  He enjoyed
quick recognition as a skilled playwright in London as a
member of the Lord Chamberlain's Company (also known as the
King's Men).  He retired in 1610, having spent a successful
career as a writer and heralded by royalty and peasants
alike.Shakespeare's privacy resulted in a sketchy timeline of the
writer's life, leading many over the years to attempt to
fill in the gaps, often with scraps of fact and fiction that
only result in nothing close to the truth (A truth we will
probably never know).  Among the rumors and hypotheses
offered over the years: that he was gay; a womanizer;
illiterate (reciting his works to a scribe), and a puppet
(in which he didn't write the works but was encouraged to
take credit to shield the real writer -- a person with
political ties).Shakespeare's sonnets give readers a glimpse into the mind
and heart of the playwright.  Published in 1609, the 154
sonnets involve the author's relationship with various
characters, including a striking young man, a mysterious
woman, and a rival poet.  The identities of the characters
have also been the subject of much speculation over the
years, despite the fact that they may have been completely
created in the mind of the bard.--------------------------------------------------------------------

"mg intergration there are clearly a large number of people who need to know what is happening on the integration of the mg metals business and a large number of fluid teams working on different aspects of the project ; however , most issues related to the integration process will only be of interest to a subset of the people involved . we currently have two main forums for information sharing available to members of the integration team : the weekly newsletter produced by fiona grant in pr , which from 30 june onwards will be sent to eel management and the heads of those departments represented on the integration team . a weekly meeting on friday mornings from 8 am to 9 am in nwl 006 , which has been put in place to provide team leaders with an opportunity to update the entire integration team on their top two or three issues for the past and / or coming week . for now , i expect the weekly update and the weekly meetings to meet the information needs of the integration team . if you feel this is not adequate , then let either myself or fiona grant know and we ' ll do a re - think on the subject . to this end , and in the interests of ensuring that we conclude our discussion in the allotted time , the following are a few organisational points i would like everyone to bear in mind when attending the friday morning meeting : attendees should distinguish between presenters and audience at the weekly meeting . presenters should attend if at all possible and , in the event they are unable to attend , should nominate a replacement for the meeting ( replacements should be notified to esther gerratt in advance of the friday morning meeting if possible ) . for the time being , presenters and their designated areas are : - eric gadd commercial and acquisition progress - amita gosalia eol - justin boyd legal - toby knight premises - barry sangster it infrastructure - bob campbell it applications - richard sage middle and back offices and project management - lloyd fleming rac - tim davies credit - anne edgley finance - anne hicks cash management - janine juggins tax - andrea kerch us gaap and due diligence - nigel sellens hr - fiona grant pr - bruce garner business development as this is intended to be an "" update "" - only meeting , any unresolved substantive issues are to be taken off - line and the resolution reported the following week . lastly , i would request that presenters focus on communicating , in an efficient manner , things which affect other functions within the integration process . doing so will assit other presenters in relaying the information presented at the meeting to other personnel in their respective areas . i hope you find this useful . we want to keep the information flowing as we continue the integration process , but at the same time we need to make sure we use our time wisely and efficiently . regards , eric",Safe Email

"reminder of coling-acl ' 98 workshop deadline ( cvir ' 98 ) call for papers coling-acl 1998 workshop content visualization and intermedia representations ( cvir ' 98 ) august 15 , 1998 university of montreal montreal , quebec , canada workshop description : in the last few years , multimedia systems have become available which integrate text , graphics , sound ( speech and non-speech audio ) , as well as animation . there are many different communities working on such systems ( e . g . , hypermedia , human-machine interaction , information retrieval , scientific visualization , content extraction , dialog tracking ) , each with distinct concerns and goals , and often the communities are not aware of each other 's research and methods . this workshop aims to bring together these communities to examine the questions of the visual presentation of diverse content through multiple media . the major goal is to explore common intermedia representation languages which are expressive enough to cover diverse modalities yet suitably appropriate for the individual media . with increasing amounts of data , information , and knowledge available to the user , the effective use of visualization is increasingly important in applications . examples include : # visualization of data in scientific literature , including support for interactive information retrieval ; # business and finance data visualization ( data profiling ) ; # automated or assisted map , graph , diagram , or image construction from text or data ; event , process , and knowledge editing and visualization tools ; # and knowledge navigation over databases , texts , and search results . the specific issues addressed by the workshop include but are not limited to : 1 . definition of content : different disciplines and applications have distinct perspectives on what content is , e . g . , of text , video , graphics , collections of interactions or correspondences . 2 . knowledge representation : i . e . , what it is , how to represent it , reason about it , and present it . 3 . taxonomies of content representations , tasks , and visualization artifacts . 4 . representations for content and how these relate to and / or facilitate visualization tasks . 5 . selection and organization of content : deciding what to present and how to organize the presentation of selected content and why ( i . e . , effect ) . 6 . deciding how to coordinate the presentation of content through several media : 7 . the relationship of cognitive task to visualization content and style ( e . g . , visualization structure , properties , form , coherency , interpretability , and accuracy of displays ) . 8 . deciding how to accept and integrate input from several media . 9 . medium - specific encoding of content . 10 . presentation and interaction techniques of generated results . 11 . tailoring visualizations to specific user and usergroup characteristics , knowledge , and interests . 12 . content visualization evaluation metrics and methods . we encourage submissions of demonstrations and / or videos of working visualizations pertaining to the above topics . the organizers will produce a workshop report and , providing there is sufficient interest and adequate results reported , will consider a special edited journal issue and / or state of the art collection . authors are encouraged to submit their workshop papers simultaneously for public discussion to the area intelligence user interfaces of the electronic transactions on artificial intelligence ( etai ) . the etai is a new kind of electronic journal using open and posteriori reviewing . formally , the rules work as follows . in the etai , you first have the article discussed for three months , then you have a chance to revise it based on the feedback , and then you decide whether to submit it for refereeing in the etai or in some other journal . for more information , see : http : / / www . ida . liu . se / ext / etai / . sponsors : sigmedia ( acl 's special interest group on multimedia language processing ) acl / coling program committee : elisabeth andre , dfki saarbruecken branimir boguraev , ibm watson research steve feiner , columbia university michael johnston , oregon graduate institute mark maybury , mitre corporation james pustejovsky , brandeis university steve roth , carnegie mellon university wolfgang wahlster , dfki saarbruecken kent wittenburg , gte laboratories program chairs : james pustejovsky , brandeis university mark t . maybury , mitre requirements for submission : papers are invited that address any of the topics listed above . maximum length is 8 pages including figures and references . please use us or a4 letter format and set margins so that the text lies within a rectangle of 6 . 5 x 9 inches ( 16 . 5 x 23 cm ) . use classical fonts such as times roman or computer modern , 11 to 12 points for text , 14 to 16 points for headings and title . latex users are encouraged to use the acl style file for latex . ms - word users should use the acl style file for ms - word . submissions can be made either as hardcopies or electronically in ascii , postscript , html , or ms - word format . they should be sent to : james pustejovsky cvir ' 98 computer science department 258 volen brandeis university waltham , ma 02254-9110 voice : 1-781 - 736-2709 fax : 1-781 - 736-2741 email : jamesp @ cs . brandeis . edu more detailed information on the workshop can be found at : http : / / www . cs . brandeis . edu / ~ jamesp / cvir / timetable * deadline for electronic submissions : march 11 , 1998 * deadline for hardcopy submissions : march 13 ( arrival date ) * notification of acceptance : may 1 , 1998 * final manuscripts due : june 12 , 1998 organizer information : mark t . maybury , director advanced information systems center the mitre corporation ( ms k308 ) 202 burlington road bedford , ma 01730 tel : 1-78 - 271-7230 fax : 1-781 - 271-2780 maybury @ mitre . org james pustejovsky , associate professor computer science department and volen center for complex systems brandeis university waltham , ma 02254-9110 voice : 1-781 - 736-2709 fax : 1-781 - 736-2741 jamesp @ cs . brandeis . edu james pustejovsky associate professor computer science department and volen center for complex systems brandeis university waltham , ma 02254-9110 usa voice : 1-781 - 736-2709 fax : 1-781 - 736-2741 jamesp @ cs . brandeis . edu http : / / www . cs . brandeis . edu / ~ jamesp http : / / www . cs . brandeis . edu / ~ rllc",Safe Email

which hasn't yet been released (again). Bad enough the first time, and
I'm sure it gave RedHat a lot of embarrassment.FWIW, I've yet to compile apt on the gcc 3.2 snapshot in RawHide - apt's
C++ makes several rather poor assumptions on what iterators are, and in
addition doesn't use namespaces at all.For non-C++ folk, this basically means it needs porting. I've got a
reasonable way along, now, and I'll send a suitable patch to Connectiva
or somewhere when I succeed - I can't find anything on Connectiva's site
itself for this.In addition, the rpmlib stuff has changed slightly - I've not really
started on this, but it's mainly just arguments added. The rpmlib
documentation seems somewhat poor, though, unless I've missed it.Dave.

"syntax wesley hudson . pragmatic constraints on binding into noun phrases . ph . d . diss . u . s . c . distr . by gsil publications ( gsil @ usc . edu ) this study analyzes a set of constructions referred to as specificity effects , where the possibility of extracting from within or binding into a noun phrase depends on non-syntactic properties of the np . in contrast to a number of syntactic studies of this phenomenon ( fiengo and higginbotham ( 1981 ) , bower ( 1987 ) , diesing ( 1990 ) ) , this work argues for a non-syntactic analysis of specificity effects . thus the inability to quantify into specific nps follows from a pragmatic equivalent to structurally determined wide scope readings . the class of nps which induce such wide scope readings is defined in terms of two distinct pragmatic properties . the first is referentiality as defined in burge ( 1974 ) , where the interpretations of referential nps are relativized to acts of reference performed on particular occasion of utterance . the second property is based on hawkins ( 1991 ) 's approach to anaphora with ( in ) definite nps ' and involves the implicatures speakers utilize in conveying whether or not a referent is identifiable . these pragmatic properties are shown to correlate with the opacity of nps more closely than syntactic or semantic properties . gsil pulbications patricia schneider - zioga . the syntax of clitic doubling in modern greek . 1994 in this dissertation it is argued that clitic doubling involves a predication structure where a clitic left dislocated ( cllded ) expression , which is a copy of the clitic doubled expression , is the subject of the predication and the clitic and doubled expression serve as the predicate variable ( cf . iatridou ( 1991 ) for clld ) : ( a ) noun phrasej [ predicate . . . cliticj - v noun phrasej . . . ] either the cllded or the doubled argument may phonetically delete . the difference between clitic doubling and clld is a matter of whether the topic or the doubled expression is phonetically ( but not syntactically ) deleted . this proposal accounts for what kind of lexical projections allow clitic - doubling ; the difference in behavior between accusative and oblique clitic doubled expressions ; the impossibility of doubling qps that contain expressions needing antecedents and other reconstruction effects ; as well as the scope interpretation of doubled qps . assymetries between clitic doubling and clld are also addressed . for more information , please contact : gsil @ usc . edu liliane haegeman , the syntax of sentential negation . 1993 / 94 ca . 250pp . paperbound approx . usd 50 rosenberg & sellier via andrea doria 14 , i-10123 torino ( credit card accepted ) this collection comprises papers by : l . haegeman , n . duffield , i . laka , j . ouhalla , e . pearce , l . progovac , g . puskas , m - l . rivero and r . zanuttini . it appears in two successive issues of "" rivista di linguistica "" : 5 , 2 ( 1993 ) and 6 , 1 ( 1994 ) ; the second one will be available very soon . an obvious alternative to the separate purchase of these issues is the subscription to the journal . | | | | - - - - pier marco bertinetto scuola normale superiore / / / / / / / - - - - - - - / / / / / / / - - - - - - - tel . + + 39 / ( 0 ) 50 / 509111 p . za dei cavalieri 7 / / / / / / / - - - - - - - fax : + + 39 / ( 0 ) 50 / 563513 i-56126 pisa / / / / / / / - - - - - - - / / / / / / / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - history of ling murray , stephen o .

very well, but each individual (or group?) should collect their own corpus.One problem that comes upp immediately: individuals are lazy.If I currently get 50 spam and 50 ham a day, and I'll have to
press the 'delete' button once for each spam, I'll be happy
to press the 'spam' button instead.  However, if in addition
have to press a 'ham' button for each ham, it starts to look
much less like a win to me.  Add the time to install and setup
the whole machinery, and I'll just keep hitting delete.The suggestions so far have been to hook something on the delete
action, that adds a message to the ham corpus.  I see two problems
with this: the ham will be a bit skewed; mail that I keep around
without deleting will not be counted.  Secondly, if I by force of
habit happen to press the 'delete' key instead of the 'spam' key,
I'll end up with spam in the ham, anyways.I would like to look for a way to deal with spam in the ham.The obvious thing to do is to trigger on the 'spam' button,
and at that time look for messages similar to the deleted one
in the ham corpus, and simply remove them.  To do this we
need a way to compare two word count histograms, to see
how similar they are.  Any ideas ?Also, I personally would prefer to not see the spam at all.
If they get bounced (preferably already in the SMTP),
false positives become the senders problem, to rewrite
to remove the spam smell.In a well tuned system then, there spam corpus will be much
smaller than the ham corpus, so it would be possible to be
slightly over-agressive when clearing potential spam from
the ham corpus.  This should make it easier to keep it clean.Having a good way to remove spam from the ham corpus,
there's less need to worry about it getting there by mistake,
and we might as well simply add all messages to the ham corpus,
that didn't get deleted by the spam filtering.It might also be useful to have a way to remove messages from
the spam corpus, in case of user ooops.	/Paul",Safe Email

' ' swift descent enron ' s rapid decline - - standard & poor ' s corp . slashed its credit rating eight levels this month to junk status - - centered on its dealings with partnerships the company used to move assets and debt off the company ' s books . many investors had complained enron ' s financial reports obscured the partnerships ' businesses to the point they were impossible to understand . enron ' s former chief financial officer andrew fastow led some of the partnerships and earned more than $ 30 million through their dealings with enron , the company disclosed . enron documents filed with the u . s . securities and exchange commission state that the board determined that fastow ' s participation in the partnerships would ` ` not adversely affect the interests of enron .

' s indian lenders may take over its $ 3 billion power venture to salvage loans of $ 2 billion if the energy trader files for bankruptcy in the u . s . enron may be forced into the biggest chapter 11 reorganization in history after dynegy inc . walked away from a rescue . rating agencies cut most of enron ' s $ 15 billion of debt to junk status , and its shares are almost worthless . india ' s dabhol power co . , one of enron ' s biggest asian gas and power units , has been mired in accusations of bribery and exorbitant power tariffs . ` ` lenders will have to take control of the project , ' ' said madhav godbole , who headed a panel set up to resolve a payment dispute between dabhol power , enron ' s india unit , and the maharashtra state electricity board , its sole customer . ` ` buyers ( for dabhol ) will have to negotiate with the lenders . ' ' enron , which is owed $ 64 million for bills that are more than 10 months overdue , wants $ 1 billion for its 65 percent stake in dabhol as it exits india . tata power ltd . and bses ltd . , the two bidders for enron ' s stake , have said the price is too high . both supply power to mumbai , india ' s commercial capital . the industrial development bank of india , the country ' s biggest lender , and the state bank of india are among local lenders that loaned $ 1 . 4 billion to dabhol . they have the most at stake if the loans turn bad . the $ 600 million lent by abn amro , bank of america corp . and other overseas banks is covered by government guarantees , while indian bank loans are not . cancellation notice enron on may 19 issued a six - month notice canceling power sales to the electricity board . the deadline lapsed on nov . 19 as the mumbai high court early this month stopped dabhol from serving the final termination notice until dec . 3 . the court ' s move was in response to a suit filed by indian lenders against dabhol to prevent it from canceling the contract . they were concerned the loss - making electricity board will be forced to buy the power plant , making loan recovery difficult . ` ` the matter has become extremely interesting ( for india ) in the context of dynegy pulling out , ' ' idbi chairman p . p . vora told reporters at the lenders ' earnings meet . ` ` i can ' t say more as the matter is in the court . ' ' idbi alone has lent dabhol $ 400 million . indian lenders won ' t attend a dabhol board meeting or a summit of creditors , both of which are to be held in london tomorrow , vora said , without giving any reason . dabhol ' s board is meeting to authorize k . wade cline , managing director , to serve the termination notice . discount ? enron ' s stake in dabhol may now be worth much less than the $ 1 billion it is seeking . still , potential buyers may find it hard to raise the money they will need to finish work on the plant . construction contractors in june stopped work on expansion of the power plant because they hadn ' t been paid since april . the expansion , which was to add 1 , 444 megawatts of capacity to the existing 740 megawatt capacity , and a 5 million - tons - a - year liquefied natural gas receiving terminal , is 95 percent complete . ` ` buyers may get a good price but they need $ 500 million to complete the project , ' ' said pradyumna kaul , an activist who ' s campaigned against dabhol for eight years . ` ` that is a lot of money for a project that ' s in distress and whose credibility is at its lowest ' ' with enron on the verge of collapse . awaiting ` response ' bses managing director r . v . shahi said he ' s waiting for a ` ` response ' ' from the lenders on the future course of action . ` ` they came to us with ( the project ) and our action will depend on what their approach is . ' ' bses hasn ' t set a price it would pay for the project , shahi said . ` ` we ' ve not reached that stage yet . ' ' tata power officials weren ' t available for comment . ` ` the equity value ( of enron ) will go down , helping potential buyers , but that does not solve the basic problem , that of high - cost power , ' ' godbole said . ` ` all parties linked with the project will have to make sacrifices ' ' to reduce the cost of power . dabhol ' s power charges in 2000 rose as high as 7 . 1 rupees , or 15 u . s . cents , a kilowatt - hour , compared with other suppliers ' rates of about 2 . 81 rupees . that led the electricity board to default on bills , and in may it stopped buying power from dabhol , saying it was too expensive . enron was one of the first major companies to enter india after the country ' s economy opened up to foreign investment in 1991 . it was awarded the contract to build the power plant 100 miles south of mumbai without competitive bidding . plant construction was delayed for about two years after public interest groups filed lawsuits against the project , on the grounds its power was too expensive . a state government reworked the contract just five months after scrapping it , a move that sparked accusations of the company bribing politicians in return for the contract - - a charge denied by all parties . enron bankruptcy would be largest chapter 11 filing ( updatel ) 2001 - 11 - 29 08 : 46 ( new york ) enron bankruptcy would be largest chapter 11 filing ( updatel ) ( updating with instinet share price , dividend payment . ) washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . may file for bankruptcy protection in the biggest chapter 11 reorganization in history , forcing the largest u . s . energy trader to liquidate billions of dollars in assets to pay creditors . dynegy inc . yesterday abandoned its proposed merger with enron , leaving the houston - based company burdened with debt and the likelihood of insolvency . some analysts said bankruptcy is inevitable and may come as early as today . a bankruptcy filing by enron , which reported more than $ 61 billion in assets , would top texaco inc . ' s record $ 35 . 9 billion case filed in 1987 . under chapter 11 protection , enron officials could continue to control the company while negotiating a recovery plan with creditors . an ` ` automatic stay ' ' under u . s . bankruptcy law would block debt - collection efforts , lawsuits and other actions against the company . ` ` a chapter 11 filing can be a great thing for a cash - starved company being attacked from all sides , ' ' said nancy rapoport , dean of the university of houston law center . an enron bankruptcy would affect thousands of people including the company ' s 21 , 000 employees , its customers , suppliers , investors and other creditors . the court - supervised recovery process would give enron a chance to change strategies and fix mistakes . it might take years to complete and may end in the company ' s liquidation . in addition to its energy trading operation , enron operates a nationwide gas pipeline system spanning 25 , 000 miles . it also owns portland general electric , which generates and distributes power to about 725 , 000 customers in the pacific northwest . the company ' s enron broadband services is building a global fiber - optic communications network . ` witches brew ' chapter 11 reorganization lets companies abandon onerous contracts and unprofitable leases . ` ` every bad business deal enron got into they ' ll walk away from , ' ' said peter chapman , a distressed - debt investor who also publishes newsletters on high - profile bankruptcy reorganizations . the goal in chapter 11 is a recovery plan that allows a company to pay creditors and come out of bankruptcy . a plan typically must be approved by a majority of creditors representing two - thirds of a company ' s debts . then a company would ask a bankruptcy judge for final approval . the recovery plan divides a company ' s value among various classes of creditors . under a hierarchy set by the u . s . bankruptcy code , secured creditors - - those with collateral backing their claims - - are paid ahead of unsecured creditors , such as bondholders and suppliers . financial advisers to creditors and companies in large bankruptcies say a chapter 11 recovery plan for enron would be particularly difficult to produce . ` ` you have a host of intangible assets combined with a morass of contingent liabilities creating a potential witches ' brew of a bankruptcy , ' ' said jeff werbalowsky of houlihan lokey howard & zukin , an investment banking firm that has been contacted for advice by enron bondholders . enron ' s shareholders are likely to lose all of their investment in a chapter 11 case because they would be last in line to get paid . shares , the most active in pre - market trading on instinet , gained 2 cents to 63 cents after plunging 85 percent yesterday . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent notes that mature in 2006 were unchanged at about 22 cents on the dollar , traders said . at that price the notes yield 53 percent . enron said this morning it was evaluating whether it will pay a declared dividend . the company is scheduled to pay a 12 . 5 - cent quarter dividend on dec . 20 ` black hole ' for investors now considering buying enron ' s bonds and other debts , a major issue is the uncertainty surrounding the company ' s value . ` ` until the forensic accountants can get in there and sort things out you just don ' t know what enron ' s worth , ' ' said gary hindes , managing director of deltec asset management llc . ` ` it ' s a black hole . ' ' deltec has no investment in enron , hindes said . enron ' s bond prices reflect the uncertainty . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent bonds , which mature in 2006 , were quoted at 20 cents on the dollar , down from 53 cents tuesday . some recovery for enron creditors in a bankruptcy case may come from lawsuits , said russell a . belinsky , an investment banker with chanin capital partners , which also has been approached for advice by enron bondholders . ` ` there ' s a lot of juicy legal issues , ' ' said belinsky . potential targets include enron ' s accounting firm and its officers and directors , he said . liability dynegy might face some liability for canceling its purchase of enron . dynegy invoked terms of the buyout agreement that gave it the right to purchase an enron natural gas pipeline if the takeover fell apart . dynegy received the right to the pipeline in exchange for a $ 1 . 5 billion investment in enron by chevrontexaco corp . , which owns one - fourth of dynegy . enron might use bankruptcy to prevent dynegy from walking away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the pipeline . the dynegy acquisition , valued at $ 23 billion when it was proposed on nov . 9 , collapsed as bankers failed to raise the $ 1 . 5 billion enron needed to operate until the deal was completed . the lack of funds and a credit downgrade contributed to dynegy ' s decision . bankers led by j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james b . lee tried for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed . investors turned them down because of heightened concern enron wouldn ' t be able to pay its debts . three credit - rating agencies yesterday cut enron ' s credit rating to junk status , triggering an acceleration of the company ' s debt obligations . unraveling enron ' s unraveling began in october after it said shareholders ' equity was reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of the way the company accounted for outside partnerships it created . the announcement prompted lawsuits and an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission , and enron ended up restating earnings for almost five years . as shares plunged , enron ' s trading partners lost confidence the company would have the cash to pay bills . trading partners such as mirant corp . either demanded more collateral to trade or restricted trading with the company . ` ` the situation is dire , ' ' said deltec ' s hindes . ` ` no one ' s going to trade with enron right now because you could wind up being an unsecured creditor tomorrow .

"Hi,I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.Well, grasshopper, think again ...It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called bulk email, or SPAM.If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulk emailer who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  It's that simple ...All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All it takes 
is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some 
basic familiarity with the Internet.I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.Here goes ...Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Spambook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...I personally guarantee that you will start your own

Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily

example, I teach you where to find a product to sell.

list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your

"I found this interesting, but not very original. Another search engine 
(can't remember which one tho') was doing this a long time ago.http://www.bangkokpost.com/Business/02Dec2002_biz54.html=====
Postcards from Planet GoogleINTERNET: The search engine is taking snapshots of its users' minds and 
aggregating them. So what is the world thinking about?JENNIFER 8. LEEAt Google's squat headquarters off Route 101, visitors sit in the lobby, 
transfixed by the words scrolling by on the wall behind the 
receptionist's desk: animacio{AAC}n japonese Harry Potter pense{AAC}es 
et poemes associao brasileira de normas te{AAC}cnicas.The projected display, called Live Query, shows updated samples of what 
people around the world are typing into Google's search engine. The 
terms scroll by in English, Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Japanese, Korean, 
French, Dutch, Italian _ any of the 86 languages that Google tracks.The scrolling continues: people who shouldn't marry ``she smoked a 
cigar'' mr potatoheads in long island pickup lines to get women auto 
theft fraud how to.Stare at Live Query long enough, and you feel you are watching the 
collective consciousness of the world stream by.Each line represents a thought from someone, somewhere with an Internet 
connection. Google collects these queries _ 150 million a day from more 
than 100 countries _ in its databases, updating and storing the computer 
logs millisecond by millisecond.Google is taking snapshots of its users' minds and aggregating them.So what is the world thinking about?Sex, for one thing.``You can learn to say `sex' in a lot of different languages by looking 
at the logs,'' said Craig Silverstein, director of technology at Google. 
(To keep Live Query G-rated, Google filters out sex-related searches, 
though less successfully with foreign languages.)Despite its geographic and ethnic diversity, the world is spending much 
of its time thinking about the same things. The same topic areas bubble 
to the top: celebrities, current events, products and computer downloads.``It's amazing how similar people are all over the world based on what 
they are searching for,'' said Greg Rae, one of three members of 
Google's logs team, which is responsible for building, storing and 
protecting the data record.Google's following _ it is the most widely used search engine _ has 
given Mr Rae a worldview from his cubicle. Since October 2001, he has 
been able to reel off ``anthrax'' in several languages, including 
milzbrand in German and carbonchio in Italian. He says he can also tell 
which countries took their recent elections seriously (Brazil and 
Germany), because of the frenzy of searches. He notes that the 
globalisation of consumer culture means that the most popular brands are 
far-flung in origin: Nokia, Sony, BMW, Ferrari, Ikea and Microsoft.Judging from Google's data, some sports events stir interest almost 
everywhere: the Tour de France, Wimbledon, the Melbourne Cup horse race 
and the World Series were among the top 10 sports-related searches last 
year. It also becomes obvious just how familiar American movies, music 
and celebrities are to searchers across the globe. Two years ago, a 
Google engineer named Lucas Pereira noticed that searches for Britney 
Spears had declined, indicating what he thought must be a decline in her 
popularity. From that observation grew Google Zeitgeist, a listing of 
the top gaining and declining queries of each week and month.Glancing over Google Zeitgeist is like taking a trivia test in cultural 
literacy: Ulrika Jonsson, the Swedish-born British television host and 
girlfriend of England football coach Sven Goran Eriksson, made the list 
recently. So did Irish Travellers (a nomadic ethnic group, one of whose 
members was videotaped beating her young daughter in Indiana) and 
fentanyl (the narcotic gas used in the Moscow raid to rescue hostages 
taken by Chechen rebels in late October).The long-lasting volume of searches involving her name has made Britney 
Spears something of a benchmark for the logs team. It has helped them 
understand how news can cause spikes in searches, as it did when she 
broke up with Justin Timberlake.Google can feel the reverberations of such events, and others of a more 
serious nature, immediately.On Feb 28, 2001, for example, an earthquake began near Seattle at 10:54 
am local time. Within two minutes, earthquake-related searches jumped to 
250 a minute from almost none, with a concentration in the US Pacific 
Northwest. On Sept 11, searches for the World Trade Center, Pentagon and 
CNN shot up immediately after the attacks. Over the next few days, 
Nostradamus became the top search query, fuelled by a rumour that 
Nostradamus had predicted the trade center's destruction.But the most trivial events may also register on Google's sensitive 
cultural seismic meter.The logs team came to work one morning to find that ``carol brady maiden 
name'' had surged to the top of the charts.Curious, they mapped the searches by time of day and found that they 
were neatly grouped in five spikes, each one starting at 48 minutes 
after the hour.As the logs were passed through the office, employees were perplexed. 
Why would there be a surge in interest in a character from the 1970s 
sitcom The Brady Bunch? But the data could only reflect patterns, not 
explain them.That is a paradox of a Google log: it does not capture social phenomena 
per se, but merely the shadows they cast across the Internet.``The most interesting part is why,'' said Amit Patel, who has been a 
member of the logs team. ``You can't interpret it unless you know what 
else is going on in the world.''So what had gone on on April 22, 2001?That night the million-dollar question on the game show Who Wants to Be 
a Millionaire? had been, ``What was Carol Brady's maiden name?'' Seconds 
after the show's host posed the question, thousands flocked to Google to 
search for the answer (Tyler), producing four spikes as the show was 
broadcast successively in each US time zone.The precision of the Carol Brady data was eye-opening for some.``It was like trying an electron microscope for the first time,'' said 
Sergey Brin, who as a graduate student in computer science at Stanford 
helped found Google in 1998 and is now its president for technology. 
``It was like a moment-by-moment barometer.''Predictably, Google's query data respond to television, movies and 
radio. But the mass media also feed off the demands of their audiences. 
One of Google's strengths is its predictive power, flagging trends 
before they hit the radar of other media.As such it could be of tremendous value to entertainment companies or 
retailers. Google is quiet about what if any plans it has for 
commercialising its vast store of query information. ``There is 
tremendous opportunity with this data,'' Mr Silverstein said. ``The 
challenge is defining what we want to do.''Google currently does not allow outsiders to gain access to raw data 
because of privacy concerns. Searches are logged by time of day, 
originating IP address (information that can be used to link searches to 
a specific computer), and the sites on which the user clicked. People 
tell things to search engines that they would never talk about publicly 
_ Viagra, pregnancy scares, fraud, facelifts. What is interesting in the 
aggregate can be seem an invasion of privacy if narrowed to an individual.In aggregate form, Google's data can make a stunning presentation. Next 
to Mr Rae's cubicle is the GeoDisplay, a 40-inch screen that gives a 
three-dimensional geographical representation of where Google is being 
used around the globe. The searches are represented by coloured dots 
shooting into the atmosphere. The colours _ red, yellow, orange _ convey 
the impression of a globe whose major cities are on fire. The tallest 
flames are in New York, Tokyo and the San Francisco Bay area.Each country has a distinctive usage pattern. Spain, France and Italy 
have a midday lull in Google searches, presumably reflecting leisurely 
lunches and relaxation. In Japan, the peak usage is after midnight, when 
phone rates for dial-up modems drop.Google's worldwide scope means that the company can track ideas and 
phenomena as they hop from country to country.Take Las Ketchup, a trio of singing sisters who became a sensation in 
Spain last spring with a gibberish song and accompanying knee-knocking 
dance similar to the Macarena.Like a series of waves, Google searches for Las Ketchup undulated 
through Europe over the summer and fall.The Ketchup Song (Hey Hah) has already topped the charts in 18 
countries. In late summer, Google's logs show, Las Ketchup searches 
began a strong upward climb in the United States, Britain and the 
Netherlands.Haven't heard of Las Ketchup?If you haven't, Google predicts you soon will.

Saturday, July 20, 2002Mac fans flocked to the Macworld Expo in New York to watch Apple Computer trot out new hardware, software and even a Web services plan--but it might be a challenge getting people to pay for the offerings.
Apple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by unveiling new iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the existing 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod for $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three models for Windows users with MusicMatch software.As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel monitor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolution versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac.Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change the background photo as often as every 5 seconds.But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a cheap upgrade when the company announced it will not offer a discounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to current users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will have to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating system for the retail price of $129.Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qualitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions share the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and services, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvous, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software.Apple also raised eyebrows by transitioning its iTools Web services from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans to charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web services was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other features.Despite iTool's popularity, the company may face a tough sell with the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture. Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently.To its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organized than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However, an online petition protesting the new charges doesn't bode well for the program.Microsoft's moves
Not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, Microsoft plans to offer a rebate for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version of the software.The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have not met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000 copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the program went on sale last November.Microsoft is also putting the finishing touches on the third collection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, contains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the operating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 could be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security fixes are available as separate downloads.
Not everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Microsoft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has shut down a site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. The company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004.Somebody's watching youYou better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yahoo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as ""mocha"" and ""eval"" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contain JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example.""Mocha"" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced e-mail. Typing ""mocha:"" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which commands can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person's knowledge.
On the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. government is again turning to technology to monitor suspicious activity in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled more details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or suspicious behavior.""The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the daily course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual or suspicious activity in public places,"" according to the TIPS Web site. But the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan, fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possibly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant.Also of note

The restrictive law regarding audio is actually the accumulated cruft of
30 years of various legislative acts. The totality of what we have now
come from various parts of all the following re: sound recordings:1998 - DMCA
1995 - Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act
1992 - Audio Home Recording Act
1976 - Copyright Act amendment
1972 - Copyright Act amendmentIt is worth noting that many people have forgotten about the 1976
Copyright Act Amendment which created the foundational law stating that
the copyright owners have the right to limit personal use of audio
recordings after First Sale even if you are not ""making copies"" in any
commercial sense.  Sound recordings, for many intents and purposes, are
explicitly excluded from Fair Use by the 1976 amendment.-James Rogers

"proposed decision the gd article today regarding the proposed decision is a pretty good readers digest version of the order . susan and i spoke with jeff dasovich and mark baldwin yesterday , and the consensus of those conversations was that transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of implementation / documentation . jeff offered that he might send a letter to governor gray ' s office expressing both dismay and indignation that the cpuc didn ' t complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to california ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved . he may ask the other comprehensive settlement parties to join in signing the letter . susan , mark and i spoke about this idea later , and we ' ve got some reservations about tw ' s role in admonishing the cpuc . we should probably wait to see this letter first before committing to anything . bilas draft cautious toward socal competition mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state , california public utilities commissioner richard bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more moderate approach to promoting competition on southern california gas  , ( socal ) system . in his draft decision , bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundling of intrastate transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case , the less far - reaching interim settlement ( is ) , submitted in december 1999 . socal , san diego gas and electric and other parties filed two more settlements after the is , reaching a comprehensive agreement in april this year . but since then , gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state , prompting a consumer backlash and giving competition a bad name . the draft language notes that the first interim settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements . recent events  & lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this investigation , the unbundling of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm , tradable intrastate transmission rights , should be delayed ,  8 according to the draft order .  & this unbundling is the basis of the [ comprehensive settlement ] and we cannot approve it . we do not , however , wish to commit to paralysis until 2006 , as the [ post - interim settlement ] would have us do . accordingly , we believe californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption , with modifications , of the is .  8 the biggest change to the is in the draft is the rejection of an automatic capacity expansion by socal at wheeler ridge , calif . , with rolled - in rates if certain criteria are met . el paso energy had objected to the provision in the is that would have allowed socal to automatically expand capacity at wheeler ridge by 100 million cfd if a certain number of curtailments oc - curred . el paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at wheeler when only certain customers would benefit . the draft says socal can file a separate application for the wheeler ridge expansion , but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing process . the draft decision would also :   end socal  , s current    establish hector road as a formal receipt point for nominations ;   institute an operational flow order ( ofo ) procedure . provides a forum for more changes in ofo procedures if excessive ofos are made ;   set up    make changes to balancing rules , while retaining the current 10 % monthly imbalance tolerance ;   make socal  , s own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balancing rules and penalties as all other shippers ;   allow some limited imbalances trading , as well as the right to assign and reassign unbundled storage contract in a secondary market , with a socal electronic bulletin board set up for it ;   unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost exceeding that required for core minimum reliability ; and   provide for rate recovery of up to $ 3 . 5 million in implementation costs . in addition , the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from rates , eliminate core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges , eliminate the core subscription option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs . the threshold for participating in core aggregation is reduced , and billing options are offered to core aggregators . bilas  , draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years to open another investigation into gas competition , taking into account any changes in market conditions . bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft .  we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by marketers if more competition is allowed ,  8 bilas wrote in the draft decision .  & with half the state already committed to a restructured competitive natural gas industry , it suddenly seems as if the benefits of such re - structuring to enhance competition are speculative , particularly at this time . with one leg in the water , the current has switched direction and it will be difficult , if not foolhardy , to reach our goals by forging ahead .  & we choose to take a cautious approach again ,  8 the draft continues .  & rather than proceeding to unbundle transmission in southern california now , we approve , with modifications , the settle - ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market . additionally , we unbundle core interstate transmission and once again urge the legislature to pass consumer protection legisla - tion aimed at unregulated marketers while we facilitate growth in core aggregation programs .  8 the cpuc would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission and other restruc - turing in the future  & but believe that at this point in time the certain benefits do not outweigh the costs to most ratepayers .  8 all drafts must be filed 30 days before the meetings at which they will be discussed . the draft decision is currently on the agenda for the cpuc  , s dec . 21 meeting .",Safe Email

I'm working with an experimental text recognition/processing engine that
exhibits similar characteristics.  It can read right through
misspellings like the above without any difficulty.  And as the author
above suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally.If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything
like the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason the
first letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is
that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially
more difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be
resolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are far
less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.  Cheers,-James Rogers

resulted in mostly short-duration relationships and single-parented,

"message from charles shen at williams dear vince : how are you ? thanks for coordinating an offer for me . as i told stinson early this week , i understand that it is a little bit tricky for enron in term of my starting date . to be honest , i am very flexible myself , it really depends on enron . if you want me to start right now , then i would expect enron to compensate for my this year ' s bonus . in this case , it is not quite fair for enron , since now we are already at the end of october . another option is that we can work out an offer right now , and i can start my new job right after i get my bonus from williams , which should be in the very beginning of february . this choice is perfectly fine with me . actually it might be even a little better for me since williams has had very good year this year . vince , i just want to tell you that i am very interested in your group , and very excited about this opportunity . if you have any questions , please feel free to call me at 918 - 409 - 4308 . sincerely , charles do you yahoo ! ? yahoo ! messenger - talk while you surf ! it ' s free . http : / / im . yahoo . com /",Safe Email

"" enron makes the market . make no mistake about that , "" said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey . "" there ' s not a trader out there that doesn ' t use enrononline . "" as such , enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company ' s credit - worthiness is critical . enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday . the company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid . enron said its new chief financial officer is jeffrey mcmahon , the 40 - year - old head of the company ' s industrial - markets division . his selection may be intended , in part , to raise the company ' s credibility . people familiar with the matter say mr . mcmahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about mr . fastow ' s role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with enron . internal partnership documents indicate mr . fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships . mr . fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in july in the face of increasing conflict - of - interest concerns being expressed by wall street analysts and major enron investors . on monday , enron announced that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the fastow - related transactions . while enron as recently as tuesday strongly defended mr . fastow , as well as the company ' s dealings with the partnerships , controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive ' s departure . "" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , "" said chairman and chief executive kenneth lay in a prepared statement . enron said mr . fastow "" will be on a leave of absence from the company . "" he couldn ' t be reached for comment . it remains to be seen how much mr . fastow ' s removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community . the action came after the 4 p . m . market close and followed a day in which enron ' s stock once again plunged . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares were at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 , or 17 % . it topped the big board ' s most active list at nearly 76 million shares , more than twice the volume of the second - most - active stock . several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800 , 000 shares or more , possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on enron stock . enron ' s shares are down about 50 % from the beginning of last week . earlier this year , the stock was above $ 80 a share . in an apparent ripple effect , the stocks of other energy - trading companies , which do business with enron , also fell sharply yesterday . for instance , dynegy inc . shares on the big board were off $ 5 . 45 , or 13 % , at $ 37 . 26 . a number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than enron ' s , which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles . prudential securities analyst carol coale said mr . fastow ' s departure could be seen as evidence that "" management does care "" about investor concerns . however , she adds , the move also could be viewed by some investors , coming as it did two days after the announcement of the sec inquiry , as "" an admission of guilt . "" ms . coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on enron largely because of uncertainties about the company ' s extremely complex financial structure . enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its fastow - related dealings . worries and rumors about enron ' s financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday . goldman sachs analyst david fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible "" death spiral "" in which increasing credit concerns about enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company , which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions . mr . fleischer , a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company , said he hasn ' t yet seen any evidence of such a problem . however , mr . fleischer said , enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities . enron is facing a problem with "" trust and credibility . it ' s not easy to regain something as basic as trust , "" he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c enron ousts finance chief as s . e . c . looks at dealings by floyd norris 10 / 25 / 2001 the new york times page 2 , column 5 c . 2001 new york times company the enron corporation , its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence , yesterday ousted its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron has drawn the scrutiny of the securities and exchange commission . ' ' in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as c . f . o . , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said in a statement announcing the change . only one day before , mr . lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the enron board ' ' continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy . ' ' the company said that mr . fastow had taken a leave of absence , but it also named his successor , jeffrey mcmahon , the head of enron ' s industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer . enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night . the move came after the close of trading on the new york stock exchange , where enron ' s shares fell $ 3 . 38 , to $ 16 . 41 . the price has been cut in half since oct . 16 , when enron reported its third - quarter earnings . a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that mr . fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release . mr . lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed , but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $ 1 billion write - off that was disclosed in the earnings document , and were angered when they later learned about it . on tuesday , when both mr . fastow and mr . lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call , neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by mr . fastow . mr . lay cited the s . e . c . inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions . the fact the transactions took place has been known for a year , but enron ' s disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand . by structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver enron stock , it appears that enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses , but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement . that is one of the issues the s . e . c . , whose inquiries were disclosed monday by the company , is expected to address . concerns have also grown this week over whether enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying - - either in cash or with stock - - if things went wrong . on tuesday , mr . fastow assured investors that the company ' ' expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations , ' ' and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate . mr . fastow was viewed as one of the architects , with jeffrey k . skilling , the former enron chief executive who resigned in august , of the change in business strategy that turned enron from a gas - pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large wall street following . its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $ 90 . 75 . according to a person close to the company , while mr . mcmahon , mr . fastow ' s successor , was enron ' s treasurer , he told mr . skilling , who at the time was the chief operating officer , that he thought the partnerships involving mr . fastow presented a conflict of interest . after that discussion , mr . mcmahon moved to a different job at the company , this person said . shares of enron traded as low as $ 15 . 51 yesterday afternoon , the lowest price for the stock since early 1995 , before recovering . in after - hours trading , they fell to $ 16 . 14 . one of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by m . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , to drop her rating to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' hold . ' ' she had lowered the rating to ' ' hold ' ' from ' ' buy ' ' on monday . ' ' after the s . e . c . inquiry was announced , ' ' she said in an interview yesterday evening , ' ' enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat , as a gesture to the street . now they are replacing him today . the timing is a little late , but i think it will be received positively by the street .

"" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , "" enron chairman and ceo ken lay said in a statement after the stock market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares . enron , which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons , found itself high on wall street ' s hit list after it released third - quarter earnings on oct 16 . the earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at : fastow , with the approval of enron ' s board , had formed and run two investment partnerships - - ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . the partnerships , which did complex financing and hedging deals with enron , served as a source of funding for enron projects and investments . but wall street questioned how fastow could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time . so fastow , in june , resigned his roles at the partnerships and enron also ended its relationships with the ljm entities . during the third - quarter , enron took a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . tuesday , lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously followed to ensure the interests of enron and its shareholders were protected in dealings with the ljm partnerships . he said a "" chinese wall "" existed between enron and ljm . fastow ' s replacement , mcmahon , previously served as enron ' s treasurer before moving last year to another job with enron . most recently , he headed up the company ' s industrial markets group . a source close to enron said mcmahon asked to be reassigned from the treasurer ' s job because he was uncomfortable with the fastow - ljm setup . enron spokesman mark palmer said neither fastow nor mcmahon was available for comment wednesday . he also didn ' t know whether fastow is still receiving a salary . enron disclosed on monday that federal securities regulators had begun an "" informal inquiry "" into the ljm dealings . the news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications , water and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of ceo jeff skilling in august for personal reasons . a continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against enron followed the earnings report and the news of the sec inquiry . wall street has stepped up its chronic complaints that enron ' s various financial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give analysts enough data to make proper evaluations . beyond the ljm partnerships , investors are concerned about two other partnerships enron set up . among the worries is that enron will end up having to issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities . investors wouldn ' t like that because it would dilute the value of current outstanding shares . they are also afraid that enron ' s debt credit rating may be downgraded , which could have negative impacts on its overall business . in the last six days , enron ' s shares have closed lower and lower . on oct . 16 , the stock closed at $ 33 . 84 . on wednesday it closed at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 . wednesday , the hubbub surrounding enron also dragged down shares in other companies that engage in energy trading , including houston - based dynegy , which closed down $ 5 . 45 at $ 37 . 26 . there is concern enron ' s woes could in some way end up harming the energy trading markets . a conference call lay and senior executives , including fastow , held with analysts tuesday to help clear up questions didn ' t go as enron hoped . on wednesday , carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston , moved from a "" hold "" to a "" sell "" rating . front page -

first section - enron replaces finance chief - energy company attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price . enron , the us energy group , yesterday replaced its embattled chief financial officer , andrew fastow , to try to halt a slide in its share price , which has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week . kenneth lay , enron ' s chief executive officer , said after the market closed that mr fastow was taking a leave of absence . the move came a day after mr lay defended mr fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partnerships that had forced enron to take a $ 1 . 2 bn write - off . that loss , revealed last week , sparked the share sell - off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come . enron disclosed the loss during an october 16 conference call with analysts on its third - quarter results , saying the charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that enron had set up in the partnerships established with mr fastow . analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained , leading to confusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . "" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , "" mr lay said . he said jeff mcmahon , chairman and chief executive of enron ' s industrial markets group , would replace mr fastow . mr mcmahon earlier served as enron ' s treasurer . analysts said it was unclear whether mr fastow ' s departure would be enough . carol coale , of prudential securities , said the move was positive in demonstrating that enron was being sensitive to wall street , which had called for mr fastow to be replaced . yet , she added , it came three days after those calls . ms coale issued a "" sell "" recommendation on enron earlier yesterday , leading to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price . "" we are concerned about what we don ' t know , "" ms coale said . she was concerned that enron might have to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating , or be forced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet . enron might also lose customers to competitors that were not under such pressure . enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the sec inquiry will prove the company has done nothing wrong . lex , page 16 .

' ' on a recent conference call ` ` no one thought they did themselves any favor in terms of calming investors ' concerns . ' ' ` ` they were slightly hiding behind the fact that the sec has got this inquiry going . the fact that two days later andy is gone , and he was in the center , is a good sign that the company is realizing just how concerned investors are . ' ' ` ` there ' s always that worry once the sec gets involved that it could extend . you never know what could come of that . ' ' ` ` there is a bit of fear of the unknown about enron now , with the sec inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset write - downs . ' ' ` ` another thing they ' re criticized for is their lack of disclosure . we still haven ' t seen a balance sheet for the third quarter . ' ' ` ` people are saying , why don ' t you include a balance sheet with your results ? they promised better disclosure in the past and that was meant to begin in the third quarter . ' ' ` ` you ' d like to see just more information on asset write - downs and a discussion of their off - balance - sheet financing - - all these vehicles they have like marlin and osprey . ' ' ` ` we ' d like to see some clarity , answering those sort of questions . ' ' ` ` it seems as though enron at least are maybe at the start of a process where they ' re going to address and clean up their balance sheet and they ' ve started to replace management . ' ' ` ` investors have already had enough issues ' ' in corporate bonds recently and ` ` sometimes investors just think , ` not another nasty in my portfolio , ' and i ' d rather exit . ' ' ` ` for certain investors maybe they just get scared . i wanted to know more about it . people had speculated if it could go to junk . i don ' t think they could because i don ' t think enron could exist as a junk company . ' ' ` ` there ' s a certain reluctance ' ' to sell the bonds . ` ` you want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals . ' ' ` ` when the spreads have already moved out that wide you have to reassess and see whether you think it ' s a buying opportunity .

"" a . g . edwards & sons analyst mike heim , however , said it will take more than replacing fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty looming in the financial world about enron and its partnerships .

"" there is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more transparent to the financial community , "" heim said .

"" i didn ' t hear things like we ' ve unrolled all these partnership dealings or here ' s all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don ' t ever expect to take any more charges , "" heim said . "" what i heard is we don ' t have to disclose that information until the 10 - q is filed . "" the turbulent past few months which have included the sec inquiry , third quarter losses and the august resignation of the company ' s chief executive officer , jeff skilling , have left many analysts questioning the company ' s future , heim said . "" it ' s really a speculative bet right now , but the odds favor the company being able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year from now , two years from now , "" he said . but much is going to depend on how much enron discloses to its investors , feygin said . feygin said mcmahon worked as enron ' s treasurer for two years under fastow before a disagreement over fastow ' s involvement in the partnerships caused mcmahon to leave his job as treasurer . "" internally , jeff was always a proponent of andy not being involved in ( the partnerships ) , "" feygin said .

2000 dow jones a press release says fastow is taking a leave of absence . he ' s been replaced by jeffrey mcmahon , formerly ceo of enron ' s industrial markets group . how might the enron bulls spin this ? likely , they will point to mcmahon ' s alleged opposition to fastow ' s role in the big hedging deal , called ljm 2 , to show that the "" fastow era "" is over . the wall street journal , citing anonymous sources , reported tuesday that as treasurer at enron mcmahon complained about fastow ' s possible conflict of interest . probably , the fear was that fastow couldn ' t serve enron and ljm 2 equally , especially as he was allegedly making a lot of money from ljm 2 . clearly , if mcmahon turns out to be a new broom , that ' s a positive for enron . an enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the journal ' s account of mcmahon ' s stance on ljm 2 was correct . not much else is encouraging , however . fastow ' s departure shows that it took massive drops in enron stock to force senior management into action . on a difficult conference call tuesday , ceo ken lay gave fastow resounding backing . it took wednesday ' s plunge to get lay to sign off on a new cfo . in other words , lay listens only when the market screams and hollers . how much further does the stock have to fall to bring further much - needed reforms at the company ? the spokeswoman responds that lay had discussions with analysts tuesday and wednesday that led him to the conclusion that fastow ' s replacement was necessary to rebuild investor confidence . enron culture is thick with financial sorcery . people got upset by one shadowy deal , but no one knows exactly how the company ' s core energy trading business makes money . it ' s hard to believe the ljm 2 deals were done in isolation and without the knowledge of the board . in fact , the chatter is that fastow and former ceo jeff skilling proposed the ljm 2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband business . the board apparently feared the volatility that might come from being in broadband , so fastow allegedly proposed ljm 2 as a way to hedge that volatility away . this meant ljm 2 entered agreements that gave it access to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected enron from the downside . should the whole board be on the hook , too ? the spokeswoman responds that the board would not have entered the ljm 2 transaction if it had not thought it would benefit enron and its shareholders . lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market ' s views . arguably , that ' s downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish short - term financing . letting things get this bad has risked good faith among enron counterparties and bankers . it shows an unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they ' re unavoidable . the spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency . any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated , but is it any wonder people compare this lot to long term capital management ?

"URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021002.html
Date: Not suppliedI've been snowed under for the last four weeks, working on the FogBUGZ 3.0 
Setup program. For various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits (Wise, InstallShield, 
Windows Installer) could do even 25% of what our setup program needed to do, so 
I ended up writing it from scratch. VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer 
than I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup 
process should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the 
wizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already 
made. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to 
change where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and 
everything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the 
Windows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted 
are ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result 
is a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll 
write more about what I learned.   One benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to 
have someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper 
right hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently 
infested with cranes. I took the picture from the cafe at the Tate Modern.  [IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/fbsetup.jpg (FogBUGZ 3.0 Setup)]

But anyway, I found an error message in procmail.log, which solved

Â  07.16.2002 GnomeREPORT Hackers and crackers respect only one thing: strong security. Keep the bad guys out of your PC or network with the advanced technology that's trusted by millions: ZoneAlarm Pro 3.0. This best-in-class personal firewall stops hackers cold, defends your online privacy,and sets up in minutes. Click here to download now!Well, it's been half a week since we released it, and we're still
getting record downloads for our first
FREE Gnometome. What does
that mean? Simple. Download all you want - we'll definitely make
more. In fact, we've found a way to get your products and services
a little bit of unlimited promotion on the side, too. And who
couldn't use a little more traffic nowadays? Well, unless your
data transfer bill is already sky high (which can happen when you
get featured). It's all fun and games until someone's server falls
to its knees. We're still sitting
at #5 on Amazon. If we ever
hit #1, I'll eat my hat. And, mind you, this hat has been sitting
around for quite a while; it smells like feet. You'd have to eat
three sombreros just to get the same amount of nutrition you'd get
from my hat. You're better off just going for the free stuff, I
suppose. The next time they ask: ""Do you care to Super Size that?""
You can respond, with dignity: ""My funds are sufficient for the
upgrade; I avoided spending money on something that would have
lasted longer, supported a helpful cause, and not have killed me
earlier."" It makes sense - if you think about it. The fries aren't
going to eat themselves. And if YOU don't eat the fries, who will?Put your hunger aside for just a moment. It's time for a paragraph
I like to call: ""Why you shouldn't sign up for DirectDSL."" They
went out of their way to send me an unsolicited e-mail this
evening. Now, I know what you're thinking: ""How kind of them,
Chris. You were just asking about DSL providers in yesterday's
issue. They must have read your mind!"" No, they must have rented a
list of addresses which weren't confirmed. But the fun didn't stop
there. I received a message about DirectTV from yet ANOTHER
marketing company. Their effort was indeed caught by this crafty
eye, and my money will be diverted to other (less-spammish)
businesses in the future. It's my ""direct"" way of saying: you're
not the only game in town. Anybody else care to test my patience?
I didn't think so. My blacklist gets shared with 250,000 people
from around the world. Oops! My Inbox just got slammed with more
junk; looks like Lycos will never get another click from me,
either. See what you get when you tempt fate?My good buddy, Bill,
tells me that Speakeasy.net
provides great DSL connections. He'll even get the credit if I
sign up through his affiliate link! Paul Howes agrees with him,
too: ""Static IPs are the norm, they do not use PPPoE, and they
encourage people to run servers on their DSL connection. When
looking at their packages, I suggest you look at the 'Home
Services' page. They even have ADSL up to 1.5M downstream / 768k
upstream, which I have not seen from any other provider. And that
is less than $200 a month, which is a bargain when you start
looking at the prices of a 768k SDSL line!"" And Stuart Portner is
chock full of common sense: ""Remember that a lot of DSL providers
give you the modem for free and prefer that you use theirs - at
least for initial setup / shakedown period."" All the more fries
for me, dude!

{Check your stocks} When you're doing long-term investing, the
best thing to do with your money is to invest and then ""forget
about it."" Our Gnomie buddy Brian Stevens is the type of guy that
likes to play the stock market. He's always logging into E*TRADE
and checking on his stocks. That's a lot of work! We told him to
forget about it and let Company Overview do the work. This Excel
spreadsheet and add-in is a great way to check stocks and save the
data into a separate Excel spreadsheet. Brian says, ""E*TRADE
doesn't give me half the information that Company Overview does,
such as insider trades and financial trends, along with many other
tidbits of information."" NOTE: You must use Excel 2000 or higher
for the spreadsheet to operate correctly.
Flexible Renamer v5.2.0 [426k] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA014830/english/FlexRena/
{Rename your files} I work with a lot of files throughout the day,
and sometimes I end up with a desktop cluttered with useless
copies and shortcuts - and you KNOW how I feel about clutter. I
don't need a reminder that there are five shortcuts or six copies
of something on my desktop... and that is where Flexible Renamer
comes into the picture. With Flexible Renamer, I can cut off the
""Shortcut to"" and ""Copy of"" prefixes from all my files, making
them a lot easier to read. That's not all though... you can even
make a .txt file on your desktop into a .doc document in seconds.
If you don't like your filename in all caps, then just switch them
to lower case and vice-versa. The possibilities are endless! (You
know, I always wanted to change my own name from ""Chris"" to
""Caspian Wildflowers""...)Recommend It!

Disk Investigator v1.1 [527k] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://www.theabsolute.net/sware/dskinv.html
{Restore deleted files} Have you ever deleted a file from your PC,
realizing later that you actually needed it? Yeah, me too. Best-
case scenario, I would just go to the Recycle Bin and retrieve my
deleted file. But what if I had already emptied the Recycle Bin?
(Horrors!) Luckily, Disk Investigator can come into play and save
the day. (Yay!) With Disk Investigator, I can view deleted files
or directories, and restore them if necessary. I no longer have to
wonder if I fully deleted a troublesome file... I just load up
Disk Investigator, and I'll know if the file is gone (with 100%
certainty)!

Actual Title Buttons 1.3 [1.0M] W9x/2k/XP $19.95
    Unearthed by Michael Tretyakovhttp://www.actualtools.com/
{Windows Explorer add-on} ""Actual Title Buttons lets you add the
new Minimize To Tray and Stay On Top buttons to any program's
title bar next to the Windows standard Minimize/Maximize/Close
buttons."" This program is a must for anyone who wants to avoid the
distractions of other windows popping up over your active windows.
While writing this review, I am using the ""Stay On Top"" command
for Notepad, and during this time I have already received five
instant messages. Why is this important? Normally these messages
would pop up in front of Notepad and disrupt my work... but with
Actual Title Buttons, I can keep typing without missing those
""important"" instant messages. The only difference is that they
aren't an annoyance now. The ""Minimize To Tray"" feature is great,
too, because freeing up taskbar space is a beautiful thing...
especially when you don't have to close down your programs to do
it.

{Icons for your machine} Gretchen and I are really looking forward
to moving to our new neighborhood in a little over a month.
Everything is better with a little dash of friendliness, right?
Icons are no exception. All the action on this website is based
around a city block of Electriconland. You walk into different
stores to get different pixel art icons. Walk into Gabu's Pub and
you will find icons in the likeness of Pink Floyd. You won't be
disappointed when you go around the corner and pick up your
Avengers icons from the comic store. If all this wasn't good
enough then maybe this fact alone will send you to the street of
Electriconland... all the icons are cross platform. This means you
can have your new favorite icons on your Windows, Mac, and Linux
machine, or maybe even a different one on each. The possibilities
are endless!Recommend It!
Â GnomeTIPI just hate it when I try to install a program and the
installation fails. I hate it even more when the program doesn't
leave a log file to help me track down the problem. Some would say
I am out of luck, but as long as the program uses Windows
Installer, then I am on Cloud Nine. Why am I so happy? Because for
any program that uses Windows Installer, I can turn on logging
through the Registry. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ Software \
Policies \ Microsoft \ Windows \ Installer. Add a new String
value, double-click it, and enter the following Value data:
""voicewarmup"" (sans quotes). These letters can be entered in any
order: v = Verbose output; o = Out- of-disk-space messages; i =
Status messages; c = Initial UI parameters; e = All error
messages; w = Non-fatal warnings; a = Start up of actions; r =
Action-specific records; m = Out-of- memory or fatal exit
information; u = User requests; p = Terminal properties. If you
add a plus, the existing file will be appended. If you add an
exclamation mark, each line is flushed. Now, when something fails,
I just have to check in the ""Temp"" directory and look for my log
files. They'll vary in name, but will always start with ""Msi"" and
end with the .LOG extension. As always, make sure to backup your
registry before making any modifications.

". . . . . use hypnosis to make money ! hi . my name is dennis . i am a third-generation , professional hypnotherapist with over 22 years experience . i also , like many of you , spend a bit of time online . like you , i get hit by all sorts of mail either promoting sex sites or promising untold riches . being practical , i know multilevel marketing makes a lot of money for some people . . . the ones at the front end , at the beginning . but all the ones i have seen advertised are either the same one or clones of each other . i am sure you know the one i am talking about . i know people are still making money with it , or there would n't be so many advertisements . but they are n't making much , for two main reasons i can see . first it is the same , tired program that was old when i first went online a couple of years ago . anyone starting now would be at the tail end rather than the head . second perhaps more importantly . . . that program doesn ' t sell anything that people really want ! they wrote up some reports full of information that you probably either already know or do n't care about , just so they would have a product to sell . i have a solution . offer a product that people want to buy ! i have written clear , easy-to - read reports on self-hypnosis . most people have things they want to improve about their lives . many of these things , including stress , weight control , and smoking , can be taken care of with hypnosis . but people have good reasons why they do n't go to a hypnotherapist to take care of them . one is cost . even though being healthy saves money in the long run , people look at the short term expense and decide against it . another is pride . who wants to admit that they needed help from someone else ? it is almost like going to a psychiatrist . even though it is nothing to be ashamed of , it is still something few people want to admit . now people can learn how to take care of many of their problems themselves ! not only will they save money , they will have a sense of pride in being able to do it themselves . i am sure you have heard someone say before , "" i lost 15 pounds "" or "" i quit smoking . "" they are proud of what they have accomplished . i keep saying "" they "" because even though you will be able to use this knowledge for yourself , you will make your money by selling the reports to the many people that are also interested in hypnosis . with that other program i mentioned people have made a lot of money selling something nobody really wants . think how well you could do selling a product that is actually worth it ! i am trying to keep this email short , but want you to think about something else . i have seen multilevel emails that had the following : 1st level - 10 members with $ 5 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 2nd level - 10 from each of those 10 ( $ 5x100 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 500 3rd level - 10 from each of those 100 ( $ 5x1 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 5 , 000 4th level - 10 from each of those 1 , 000 ( $ 5x10 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 , 000 total $ 55 , 550 if they expect that much participation in a program that old , could n't you expect twice the participation per level ? getting 20 people instead of 10 for each level would make you $ 842 , 100 ! the first three reports teach how you can hypnotize yourself to improve you life . the fourth shows how to set up your email , how to get it out to others , and other tips and strategies you can use to be a success . i want you to be a success , because each person who replies to you , asking for report 1 , will also be replying to me asking for report 2 . then , when those people contact customers , you will be receiving money and orders from people you did n't even have to contact ! they will be advertising for you ! i am now going to list the reports and the addresses to order them from . just think , your name is going to be at the # 1 position , the one that makes the most money , when you send out your emails . report 1 : general information on self - hypnosis & relaxation and stress relief the perfect combination po box 798 chepachet , ri 02814 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 2 : weight loss rvp po box 190 wahiawa , hi 96786 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 3 : quitting smoking & other uses and tips for self - hypnosis s . franco po box 623 bonsall , ca 92003-0623 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 4 : turning it into a business j . destefano box 20793 1303 e . university blvd . tucson , az 85719-0521 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ordering instructions : * order each report from the person whose address is under the report title . you will need all 4 reports , because you will receive orders ( and money ) for each one , as your name travels down each of the 4 levels . * each report costs $ 5 . 00 cash . imagine receiving 100s of $ 5 . 00 checks a day , wondering which ones have cleared , and which ones have n't . you can see why cash is a necessity . the money should be wrapped in 2 pieces of paper , concealing it to prevent theft . * on one sheet of paper you should include the name & number of the report you are ordering , your email address , and your postal address . please write clearly . if your email address have parts that can be confused , i . e . 0 vs . o , l vs . i , etc . , please specify which it is . * the report will be sent to you as quickly as possible after your order is received . it will be sent as an attached document via email , unless there is trouble with your email address . the postal address will then be used as a backup . * make sure you save each report as you receive it , so you will be ready to send it out as you start receiving your orders ! * as i mentioned earlier , instructions on how to set up the email for you to mail out are on report 4 . for now , it would be best if you saved this email , so you will have it to work with later . finally , i want to remind you that this is a legitimate business . you should treat it as such when you enter it . you can talk to the small business administration if you need help in starting your business . you will of course need to pay local and federal taxes on the money you make . but since it is money you would n't have had otherwise , giving a little of it to uncle sam won't hurt . please contact the internal revenue service for any questions you have concerning applicable taxes . even though i am confident that a little effort will make you a success in this business , i can make no guarantees and none should be implied . actual profits made may be lower , equal to , or exceed the amounts mentioned in this letter . i would wish you luck , but i do n't feel luck is as important as making good decisions and having determination .",Phishing Email

"How many Redhat admins out there use the redhat kickstart?
If you don't use it, how do you install redhat on all your 
workstations, do you do it by hand, with the cds?As we are looking at using Linux at work, I'm looking
into setting up the kickstart. There doesn't seem to
be a lot of documentation around about it.Does anybody know if it would be possible to do the following:
Get the machine to boot using DHCP and read it's kickstart
config file from teh DHCP server and in this config file
have the machine configured to use a static IP, so that when
the machine is rebooted it will come up with it's new IP.Also, There was no driver on the redhat network install flopopy
for the network card in the machine I'm installing. This required
me to uncompress the floppy image, loop mount it, add in the module
for the network card and compress it all up again. I'm not going
to be able to do this every time we get a new machine, I was
wondering if instead of having a boot floppy, you could use a boot
cdrom, but just for the purpose of having all the network card
modules on the cdrom. I'd still want it to get the packages from
an NFS server on the network.Any help with this would be greatly appreciated,
cheers,

' s share price hovered above seven - year lows touched in earlier trade monday after moody ' s investor service cut the credit status of its senior unsecured debt of north america ' s largest energy trader to two ratings above junk status . enron , the largest electricity and natural gas trader in north america , also on monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks . enron shares were down $ 1 . 40 , or 9 . 03 percent , to $ 14 . 10 on the new york stock exchange , after earlier in the session trading below $ 14 for the first time since december 1994 . moody ' s also warned that it could cut the debt rating again , now downgraded to baa 2 , as well as its rating for the enron ' s commercial paper . enron ' s credit - worthiness will have a direct affect on its day - to - day trading operations and its trading partners ' perception of making good on trades . with a credit rating hovering above junk status , the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades . last week enron shares lost almost $ 14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company ' s involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out . investors have fled enron ' s stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off - the - balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer andrew fastow in deals the u . s . securities and exchange commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest . enron compensated its partners in this off - balance sheet structure with the promise of enron shares , if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level . many industry observers see enron ' s request for additional credit , after the company tapped its banks for $ 3 . 3 billion last week , as a sign a weakness .

"" particularly in light of september 11 , the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes , "" said john puchalla , moody ' s senior economist . "" a wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year . "" rating reviews are significant because , unlike actual rating changes , they are not a "" lagging "" indicator , and suggest the future direction of corporate credit . moody ' s normally wraps up its reviews within three months . u . s . corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons . these include the weakening u . s . economy , an inability of marginal companies to raise cash , debt - financed merger activity and fallout from the sept . 11 attacks on such industries as airlines , insurance , and travel . for example , moody ' s in july warned it may cut comcast corp . ' s ratings after the philadelphia - based company bid $ 44 . 5 billion for at & t corp . ' s cable tv operations . then last month , moody ' s warned it may cut chicago - based boeing co . ' s ratings because of the attacks ' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes . in the third quarter , moody ' s warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative - grade , or "" junk "" - rated , companies , and raise the ratings of just 11 . for investment - grade companies , the gap was even more yawning : 68 - to - 11 . and in the fourth quarter ? through friday , moody ' s warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four . on monday , it downgraded embattled energy trading giant enron corp . , and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade . puchalla , however , said the decline could slow next year , in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively . "" lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs , and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues , "" he said .

( csco ) , for example , saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12 - month period . nobody questioned the viability of cisco . the difference is that over the past few years , enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question . if you ' re buying network components , you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier . after all , you ' re buying something you can touch . but if you ' re buying power or gas , what you ' re really buying is a commitment to deliver . if your supplier doesn ' t come through when the market gets tough , you ' re left totally exposed . in enron ' s energy trading business , then , credibility at every level is critical . for now , enron looks to be more than viable . but the company ' s asset - light strategy might not be . gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1 . 65 % in the third quarter from 5 . 26 % in the first quarter of 1998 . meanwhile , asset - heavy energy companies like mirant corp .

"" i think enron ' s approach is to get the major counterparties back on board as quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow , "" said the head of risk management at one uk utility that halted its trade with enron last week . "" they are talking with us about bank letters of credit , "" he said . "" the people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis .

"" we are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or by using a ' sleeve ' ( a third party trader ) , "" said a senior trader at one of germany ' s big utilities , who declined to be named . french traders said wariness about dealing with enron had dampened liquidity although enron was still in the market on monday morning .

Date: Wed, 25 Sep 2002 12:49:48 GMTMixed news from yesterday's heart checkup. First, I went seven minutes on the treadmill. That was pretty good. My heart 
was racing like it hadn't since I was in college. They also did an extensive 
ultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they're in the neck and supply my head 
with blood. More good news there. They're clear, free of plaque, healthy, not 
diseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general 
artery disease. That's good because there would be a risk of stroke if they 
were sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the 
heart). Now there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn't working very 
well. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I 
asked the doctor, does this mean I'm going to die sooner, and he said no. Does 
it mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really 
not much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the 
ones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we'll do an 
angiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass 
because of this is small. That's quite a relief. I don't like the idea of part 
of my heart not working, but what can you do about it?[1] http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=off&q=carotid+arteries&spell=1

will tell you roughly how much traffic is going through with access,

"http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/ed/front/481722Pro-hunt activists target top sightONE of Yorkshire's most famous sights yesterday became one of the first
targets in bizarre attacks on White Horse landmarks linked to the hunting
debate.
Villagers near Thirsk could not believe their eyes when they woke yesterday
to find the famous White Horse of Kilburn had acquired a rider during the
night.
In another incident, the Uffington white horse in Oxfordshire had a huntsman
and three hounds added to the ancient figure, which is thought to represent
a Celtic god or tribal symbol.
Pro-hunt activists in the Real Countryside Alliance (RCA) Â­ a radical
alternative to the better-known Countryside Alliance Â­ admitted
responsibility last night for targeting the two images.
The 314ft by 228ft landmark at Kilburn has been lovingly preserved since it
was carved in the limestone by schoolmaster John Hodgson and his pupils in
1857.
But during Monday night someone nailed on a massive figure of a huntsman
with a horn Â­ which had been cut to scale out of a single piece of white
carpet. It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse
Association, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet.
John Roberts of the association said: ""It has obviously been very well
organised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a
horn cut out of carpets.
""It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it
to bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings
to be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. It will
not get another refit for another year.
""Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle Â­ a tractor and trailer or a
lorry Â­ because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely
well planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off.""
The sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south
of England, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs
whitening.
Mr Roberts added: ""The damage as such is not great but it adds to the
deterioration, which means it will need more work next time.
""We would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to
take it away again because it was a major job.""
Andy Wilson, chief executive of the North York Moors National Park, said:
""It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud
of it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful
consideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of
vegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There
has not been a cut in the turf Â­ which would be much more of a problem. It
would seem it was carefully plotted beforehand.""
An RCA spokesman said: ""Some people in the country are getting very
frustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches
don't seem to be doing anything good.""
The Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action.
Spokesman Adrian Yelland said: ""The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates
campaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and
regrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident.""
The incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in
Yorkshire thought to be RCA work.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

Date: Not suppliedTest your knowledge with this set of movie quotes. I'll be back in a couple of 
days with the answers.
-  Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away? -  Any fool can get into college. Only a select few can say the same about 
Amanda Jones.-  My dear, since Eve picked the apple, no woman has ever been taken entirely 
unawares.-  This is Tommy. He tells people he's named after a gun, but I know he's named 
after a famous 19th century ballerina.-  When one woman strikes at the heart of another she seldom misses, and the 
wound is invariably fatal.-  I've never been alone with a man before, even with my dress on. With my 
dress off, it's _most_ unusual.-  You're nothing to me now. You're not a brother, you're not a friend. I don't 
want to know you or what you do. I don't want to see you at the hotels, I don't 
want you near my house. When you see our mother, I want to know a day in 
advance, so I won't be there.-  Kids: 10 seconds of joy, 30 years of misery.-  Sucking all the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone.-  A hundred million terrorists in the world and I gotta kill one with feet 
smaller than my sister.-  Mother, I do not need a blind date. Particularly not with some verbally 
incontinent spinster who drinks like a fish, smokes like a chimney and dresses 
like her mother.-  Have you ever seen a body like this before in your life?
She happens to be my daughter.
Oh. Then I guess you have.-  I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is.-  Of course, you won't be able to lie on your back for a while but then you 
can lie from any position, can't you?-  The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that 
it was going to happen.-  Women need a reason for having sex. Men just need a place.-  You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are 
the same decaying organic matter as everything else.-  Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue! -  The issue is not whether you are paranoid. Look around you Lenny. The issue 
is whether you are paranoid enough.-  Inconceivable!
You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. Enjoy.

been aiming for, but the freaking RedHat Kernel srpms still have been stump 
...	If we could get this and the alsa driver stuff working, it would be whole 
lot easier to try out a newer kernel ... but then the size of these rpms 
are huge, at least for us n^1 world courties ... ;-{ ...	I will keep watching and hoping that somebody comes up with a great working 
idea ...Thanks guys.

"sum : ' this ' and ' that ' dear colleagues : last week i sent a query to this list asking you about the fomral opposition between ' this ' and ' that ' in the demonstratives ( june 4 , 6 . 772 , qs : ' this ' , . . . ) . i have received 26 responses by now , and so think it necessary to compile a quick summary today as i will be away from tokyo for more than two weeks starting tomorrow . the original text of my query was as follows : some present-day ' european ' languages have only one set of simple demonstratives and the opposition of ( this ) vs . < that > is expressed by the help of ( here ) and < there > : french ceci ' this ' ce livre-ci ' this book ' cela ' that ' ce livre-l ` a ' that book ' swedish det ha "" r ' this ' den ha "" r bilen ' this car ' det da "" r ' that ' den da "" r bilen ' that car ' estonian see siin ' this ' see maja siin ' this house ' see seal ' that ' see maja seal ' that house ' my sweidish - german dictionary ( stora tyska ordboken ) gives ( der hier ) and ( der da ) as colloquial ( familia "" r , umgangssprachlich ) german forms which conrrespond to ( den ha "" r ) and < den da "" r > , respectively . how common is a demonstrative system like this ? incidentally , japanese has a rather sophisticated three-way distinction here : kono hon ' this book ( you see here ) ' sono hon ' that book ( you see there ) , the book ( under discussion ) ' ano hon ' that book ( you see over there ) ' so i ' m afraid i will have to convince my students that the japanese are extravagant even in the way of using demonstratives . though the last paragraph was intended as an allusion to the way japanese tourists spend money overseas , quite a few people , both japanese and non - japanese , took it seriously and tried to convince me that the japanese language ( sic ! ) was by no means "" extravagant "" because it was not alone in having a three-way distinction in the demonstratives . some even drew my attention to the existence of a language with a five-way distinction . i thank them for the examples of various demonstrative systems they sent me , but this is not the point i wanted to discuss . perhaps i should have stated explicitly that i was interested in the morphology of demonstrative pronouns / adjectives . it is very important that french , for instance , has one basic demonstrative pronoun-adjective , i . e . ( ce ) , on the morph-lexical level , and that the speaker of french may optionally add an element meaning either ( here ) or < there > in order to make finer distinctions ( ce livre-ci , cette table-l ' a ) . in japanese , however , there 's no single basic demonstrative pronoun-adjective like ( ce ) in french : the speaker of japanese must always choose one from the set of three lexically distinct demonstrative forms . this is a big difference , and puzzels many of my students in my estonian syntax class . here are the responses which i think have direct relevance to my interest : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i imagine that your posting was a bit abbreviated , so did not mention the swedish demonstratives denna / detta / dessa and den / det / de , which in any case are grammatically correct but not usual in conversational speech ( "" den tiden , "" "" det aaret , "" "" de fraagorna "" ) . one would expect danish and norwegian to be similar in this regard to swedish , but unfortunately i have little information to contribute . while danish does has both den / det / de and so on plus the option of adding "" der "" ( "" tag den bog , "" "" naer saa du de mennesker ? "" ; "" hvad er det der ? "" , "" jeg tager dem ( der ) "" ) , i ' m not certain whether usage is quite the same , that is , whether the "" den der "" forms predominate as they do in swedish . [ . . . ] certain dialects of american english do use "" this here "" and "" that there , "" as attested by the way schoolteachers warn their students not to use those expressions . they ' re nonstandard and are regarded as uneducated usages , though i suspect that they actually come from older dialects of british descent in which they were acceptable . - - brian white ( bfwhite @ watson . ibm . com ) - - the use of compund demonstratives is indeed common in my own mother tongue , norwegian , and i believe in all ' scandinavian ' languages , ie norwegian , danish and swedish . i feel that it is a feature of colloquial speech , and i would be surprised to find it in ( formal ) writing . in fast speech the distinction between the two demonstratives tends to be lost , at least in my own dialect ( bergen , western norway ) : den her bilen - - - - ) 'd enner bilen ' ( this car ) den der bilen - - - - ) 'd enner bilen ' ( that car ) moreover , norwegian ( and , i believe , swedish + danish ) has the distinctions : den bilen vs denne bilen ( that car vs this car ; masc . ) det huset vs dette huset ( that house vs this house ; neu . ) which seem to correspond closely to this / that in english , and are perfectly acceptable in written and spoken norwegian . - - gisle andersen ( gisle . andersen @ eng . uib . no ) - - as a native speaker , i would not really use ( der hier ) even colloquial , ( der da ) is possible , an would more likely contrast with < der dort > , which implies that ( der da ) goes along with < this > and not with < that > ! but in general : it is always a problem for native speakers of german to acquire the this / that distinction , as we do not draw the same boundaries . maybe , a more formal ( in terms of the register ) would be : ( dieses ) ( this ) and < jenes > ( that ) - - this it at least what i use in translations ( and also what my german / english dictionary advises me to do - but never trust a dictionary ) . actually , we do not use ( jenes ) very much , it goes along with very formal speech and maybe even old - fashioned . - - gertraud benke ( gertraud @ leland . stanford . edu ) - - english colloquially , esp . black eng . vernacular , uses ' this here ' and ' that there . ' ' this book here ' vs . ' this book there ' sounds perfectly normal , while ' this here book ' and ' that there book ' sound mostly like american english from the south-east portion of the u . s . - - tim beasley ( tbeasley @ ucla . edu ) - - you might be interested to know that many dialects of english ( appalachian us , and therefore some british dialects as well ) have a similar opposition to the one you ' re talking about : this here dog that there dog there is more than one demonstrative used , but the "" here "" and "" there "" seem to be relics of some old germanic usage . - - james kirchner ( jpkirchner @ aol . com ) - - in some dialects of british english ( i ' m not excluding other varieties but i do n't know them well enough ) ' this here ' and ' that there ' are perfectly acceptable eg ' look at this here postcard that she sent me ' ' pick up that there bucket ' these are normal in my dialect - - david britain ( dbritain @ essex . ac . uk ) - - there is another funny case . in colloquial english , you can say "" this here x "" and "" that there x "" . in greek , there is "" afto edho "" ( usually pronounced "" aftodho "" ) and "" ekino eki "" ( "" ekinoki "" ) with the same meaning . ( "" dh "" = postdental fricative ) - - stavros macrakis ( macrakis @ osf . org ) - - interestingly , afrikaans , as a dutch - based creole , has developed ' hierdie ' ( litt . ' here-that ' ) for ' this ' , whereas dutch itself has no such system , using simply 'd eze ' for ' this ' and 'd ie ' for ' that ' . - - henk wolf ( h . a . y . wolf @ stud . let . ruu . nl ) - - i am not sure i understand the question correctly , but in italian ( northern italian at least ) you can say questo qui - or - questo qua ( this here ) instead of "" questo "" quello li ' - or - quello la ' ( that there ) instead of "" quello "" these are both colloquial forms . i cannot really say whether they are used in other parts of italy . - - anna mazzoldi ( mazzoldi @ iol . ie ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - it seems that with a few execptions ( italian dialects , greek ) , the phenomenon seems characteristic of germanic languages and languages that have gone through strong germanic influence ( french , estonian ) . note incidentally that finnish , which is genetically closely related to estonian , is on the japanese side , and that a similar split seems to exist among the romance languages as well . interesting ? the others gave me examples of "" richer "" demonstrative systems . if you are interested in those data , please ask me for a copy of the file which contains all the responses in the unedited form . my hearty thanks to the following people who have responded to my query : philippe l . valiquette ( phlcvali @ vm1 . ulaval . ca ) gertraud benke ( gertraud @ leland . stanford . edu ) brian white ( bfwhite @ watson . ibm . com ) tim beasley ( tbeasley @ ucla . edu ) adriano paolo palma ( pyapp @ sun22 . ccunix . ccu . edu . tw ) james kirchner ( jpkirchner @ aol . com ) eugene loos ( eugene . loos @ sil . org ) murat kural ( izzyfk6 @ mvs . oac . ucla . edu ) derek gowlett ( gowlett @ beattie . uct . ac . za ) jeff allen ( jhallen @ indiana . edu ) merce ( prat @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk ) nino ( n . vessella @ agora . stm . it ) david beck ( djbeck @ uvvm . uvic . ca ) debra r west / markell ( markell @ afterlife . ncsc . mil ) anna mazzoldi ( mazzoldi @ iol . ie ) stavros macrakis ( macrakis @ osf . org ) gisle andersen ( gisle . andersen @ eng . uib . no ) david britain ( dbritain @ essex . ac . uk ) henk wolf ( h . a . y . wolf @ stud . let . ruu . nl ) kiyoko takahashi ( gc610817 @ netserv . chula . ac . th ) philippe mennecier ( ferry @ cimrs1 . mnhn . fr ) david parkinson ( dp11 @ cornell . edu ) anton sherwood ( dasher @ netcom . com ) ( nebiye . kurtboeke @ arts . monash . edu . au ) kirk belnap ( belnapk @ yvax . byu . edu ) geoffrey s . nathan ( geoffn @ siu . edu ) ( as of 09 : 30 jst june 8 , 1995 ) best wishes kazuto kazuto matsumura kmatsum @ tooyoo . l . u-tokyo . ac . jp - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - institute for cross - cultural studies ( tooyoo gengo ) faculty of letters , university of tokyo hongo 7 - 3 - 1 , bunkyo - ku , tokyo 113 japan tel . + 81 - 3-5800 - 3754 fax : + 81 - 3-5800 - 3740 , 5803-2784 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -",Safe Email
