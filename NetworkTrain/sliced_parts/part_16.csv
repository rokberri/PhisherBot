[ proverbs 17 : 17 ] if you do know that here is one hand , we ' ll grant you all the rest . we must all obey the great law of change . it is the most powerful law of nature . they want to be free and they do not know how to be just . it ' s tough to make predictions , especially about the future . avarice is the vice of declining years . an ounce of cheerfulness is worth a pound of sadness to serve god with . none merits the name of creator but god and the poet . flaming enthusiasm , backed up by horse sense and persistence , is the quality that most frequently makes for success . do a little more each day than you think you possibly can . get action . seize the moment . man was never intended to become an oyster . god is a circle whose center is everywhere and circumference nowhere . never swap horses crossing a stream . that is the consolation of a little mind you have the fun of changing it without impeding the progress of mankind . traveling is a fool ' s paradise . our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places . it is not the size of a man but the size of his heart that matters .",Phishing Email

> I think one step towards deployment is creating a re-usable tokenizer

> or easy-to-customize tokenizer.tokenize() couldn't be easier to use:  it takes a string argument, and
produces a stream of tokens (whether via explicit list, or generator, or
tuple, or ... doesn't matter).  All the tokenize() functions in GBayes.py
and timtest.py are freely interchangeable this way.Note that we have no evidence to support that a customizable tokenizer would
do any good, or, if it would, in which ways customization could be helpful.
That's a research issue on which no work has been done.> The timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical

of tokenization is just a large block cut-and-paste ... there, it's done.
Change the    from timtoken import tokenizeat the top to use any other tokenizer now.  If you want to make it easier
still, feel free to check in something better.> I'd like to see a module that can take a single message or a collection of
> messages and tokenize each one.The Msg and MsgStream classes in timtest.py are a start at that, but it's
hard to do anything truly *useful* here when people use all sorts of
different physical representations for email msgs (mboxes in various
formats, one file per ""folder"", one file per msg, Skip's gzipped gimmick,
...).  If you're a Python coder , you *should* find it very easy to
change the guts of Msg and MsgStream to handle your peculiar scheme.
Defining interfaces for these guys should be done.> I'd like to see the tokenize by customizable, too.  Tim had to exclude

> in the test data.  If other people have test data without those
> biases, they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include

customize than to edit the code.  As README.txt still says, though, massive
refactoring would help.  Hop to it!",Safe Email

"kant and innateness references to innateness in kant are not easy to find , but here is one that is relevant to the current controversy regarding linguistic "" realism "" vs . "" conceptualism . "" a middle course may be proposed bewtween the two above mentioned , namely , that the categories are neither self-thought first principles apriori of our knowledege nor derived from experience , but sujective dispositions of thought , implanted in us from the first momement , so ordered by our creator that their employment is in complete harmony with the laws of nature in accordance with which experience proceeds - - a kind of preformation-system of pure reason . . . there is this decisive ojection . . . that the necessity of the categories . . . then would have to be sacrificed . ( b167-168 . _ critique of pure reason _ trans . kemp smith . ) noam chomsky observes that "" rationalist "" as well as "" empiricist "" theories of language incorporate "" innate dispositions . "" ( _ reflections on language _ . pantheon . 1975 . p . 215 ) whether the logical modalities enter the linguistic picture is uncertain , but one can imagine that on some formulation of minimality the connection with economy of derivation may be necessary in some sense , to choose a possible example just for the purpose of illustration . if so , then such modalities may not exclude "" psychologism "" in linguistics and with it conceptualism ala chomsky . one consequence would be that arguments against extending linguistic "" psychologism "" to logic would not be barred for the fregean reasons sometimes cited by linguists ( e . g . katz and postal in _ linguistics and philosophy _ . 14 , 1991 . p . 520 . the importance of kant for the history of the philosophy of linguistics is not innateness , rather it is in recognizing that concepts are rules .

"> That always amazes me about 'regular' dreams - how often they come true.

In 1993 or so, when I was a student in Edinburgh, I had a bad dream about
being chased around a house by a scary murderous tramp who was carrying a
bag full of half-penny coins (which had long since ceased to be legal
tender). The next morning as I left the flat, I found a half-penny on the
doormat right outside our door. Fair gave me the willies, that did.TimC------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

"state senate oks bailing out edison from bankruptcy assembly plans own version for utility fyi . fairly accurate account of the activities in california . assembly released new version of hertzberg ' s bill late last night . another update to follow shortly . best , jeff state senate oks bailing out edison from bankruptcy assembly plans own version for utility lynda gledhill and robert salladay , chronicle sacramento bureau saturday , july 21 , 2001 ? 2001 san francisco chronicle url : http : / / www . sfgate . com / cgi - bin / article . cgi ? f = / c / a / 2001 / 07 / 21 / mnl 33267 . dtl sacramento - - the state senate approved a plan yesterday to keep southern california edison from falling into bankruptcy , but the bill crafted as an alternative to the pact between the utility and gov . gray davis faces an uncertain future . the bill by democratic sens . richard polanco of los angeles and byron sher of palo alto would give the state a five - year option to buy the utility ' s transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than $ 2 . 5 billion of the utility ' s debt . edison amassed an estimated $ 3 . 5 billion in debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained frozen . the assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last night , but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of mistakes that led to california ' s botched 1996 deregulation legislation haunted lawmakers . davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk before aug . 15 , a date set in the original agreement between davis and edison . lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night , but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town . "" it ' s a firm deadline , which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess , "" davis said of the aug . 15 date . davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to iron out differences between the two bills , but it is unclear whether that could be accomplished in the next few days . "" i have problems with both bills , "" davis said . "" i am heartened by the fact that there ' s a bill moving in each house . "" both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to a floor vote , and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the process . in the senate , 22 democrats voted for the edison plan , while four democrats and all 13 republicans voted no . sen . jackie speier , d - hillsborough , said she would vote for the bill in its current form , but not if any substantial changes are made . "" the legislature is ill - equipped to try to craft a deal , "" she said . "" this particular measure - - and only this one - - has the intent and clarity to protect ratepayers . i ' m leery of the bill going to the assembly and being cannibalized . "" the senate bill authorizes edison to issue $ 2 . 5 billion in bonds to pay off alternative energy producers and their banks . the bonds would be paid off through increased rates charged edison ' s largest customers and would not cover the $ 1 billion edison owes out - of - state generators . edison maintains that the senate bill will not make the company creditworthy , which would put it back in the position of buying power . the state has been spending upward of $ 50 million a day on power since january , and davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the utility can once again begin buying power . there is also hope that any deal would be used as a way to get pacific gas & electric co . out of bankruptcy . in the assembly , two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change their bill . the rescue plan by assembly speaker robert hertzberg of sherman oaks and assemblyman fred keeley , d - boulder creek , was undergoing changes to garner more support . some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines and taking municipal utilities out of the deal . assemblywoman elaine alquist , d - san jose , one of the undecided members on the edison agreement , said the original bill was too complex . "" it ' s a cleaner bill , "" alquist said . "" i think it comes down to whether this does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to pg & e . i would say i ' m tentatively satisfied . "" alquist and other democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature of the edison negotiations . only a few members of the assembly - - all former state senators now in the lower house - - voted to approve the 1996 legislation , abl 890 , that brought deregulation to california . assemblyman joseph simitian , d - palo alto , said he gave a courtesy vote to the hertzberg - keeley plan in the appropriations committee , in order to get the measure to the assembly floor and continue debate . "" as we ' ve learned from the experience of abl 890 , the devil is in the details . i have a lot of questions , "" simitian said . "" the difficulty is that very little gets done here until there is a deadline , and then once there is a deadline , too much gets done . "" hertzberg acknowledged that some assembly members were afraid the bill was getting rushed , but he said lawmakers are well - informed about the energy crisis and its details . he said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings and countless hearings on the crisis . a wild card in the assembly ' s plan was a bill by assemblyman rod wright , d - los angeles , that garnered republican support . the so - called "" straight bailout "" would give edison its $ 3 . 5 billion through a $ 2 - a - month fee levied on utility ratepayers . it was stuck in the assembly appropriations committee . e - mail the reporters at lgledhill @ sfchronicle . com and rsalladay @ sfchronicle . com . ? 2001 san francisco chronicle page a - 3",Safe Email

Only 2km diametre, this one.  Of course, that's still a lot of mass
to hit the planet even if it *is* in the form of dust and gas.
Even if Shrub's wrist-rocket managed to vaporise it, we'd still get
transference to the Earth's energy balance, only to the atmosphere
rather than the litho- or hydrosphere.

What's Hot in the World of DivX(tm) Video This Week:
Battle of the Planets in DivX, Warcraft III, and the Latest Skins
Now Sent to Over 1.6 Million DivX Fans Worldwide!
  Welcome to this week's edition of DivX News, your weekly fix of
  information about what's hot and what's cool in the world of
  DivX video.  (You are being sent this email because you subscribed to this
  newsletter at DivX.com. If you'd like to unsubscribe, follow
  the instructions at the end of this message.)
  In This Week's Issue
  --------------------  1. Classic Battle of the Planets in DivX Video
  2. Warcraft III with DivX Video Sells like Hotcakes
  3. Skins, Skins and More Skins  
  Battle of the Planets in DivX Video!
  ------------------------------------
  
  One of the best things about DivX Video is the way it has opened
  up distribution possibilities for a lot of cool videos that may
  not otherwise be widely seen. From independent short films to cult
  movies with strong underground followings, a number of filmmakers
  and distributors are discovering that DivX Video provides a great
  way to get their content in front of new audiences.
  
  A perfect example of that phenomenon is the groundbreaking
  animated series ""Battle of the Planets"" from Sandy Frank
  Entertainment. Originally shown on American television in the late
  1970s, Battle of the Planets gained a popular following and was
  one of the forerunners of the wildly popular anime style. The
  series chronicled the adventures of a group of intergalactic
  adventurers as they battled evil and protected the universe from
  invaders. Beloved among anime fans, 70s nostalgia buffs, and
  anyone who enjoys great sci-fi animation, the series is the
  subject of a number of fan sites and discussion groups throughout
  the Internet. You can now re-live the adventures of the Battle of
  the Planets crew in high-quality DivX video. The classic episode
  ""Mammoth Shark Menace"" is currently featured on the DivX Showcase,
  and stay tuned for more news about future Battle of the Planets
  episodes to come.* Watch ""Battle of the Planets 55: Mammoth Shark Menace"" in the
  DivX Showcase:
  
  Warcraft III Sets Sales Records
  -------------------------------  A while ago, we told you that the highly anticipated game
  ""Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos"" from Blizzard Entertainment would
  feature DivX Video for cinematic cut scenes. In early July,
  Blizzard released ""Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos"" with
  record-setting results, shipping over 4.5 million copies to
  retailers. Coincidence? You be the judge. You can look forward to
  more announcements about DivX technology in some of your favorite
  games in the near future....* Watch the ""Warcraft III"" Trailer in High-quality DivX Video:

Date: 2002-10-06T18:12:44+01:00We in the game industry know what we mean when we say that a game is 
""addictive."" We think that quality in a game is a good thing: people like it, 
they keep coming back to it, and they want to play it more and more. I agree 
that it's a good thing. If a game has that quality, then it's probably a darn 
good game. But using the word ""addiction"" to describe that quality does us no 
favors with the general public.

"policies moderators ' message a very happy 1995 to all our subscribers ! as you can see , linguist is back on line - - on the 8th , not the 5th as we had hoped , but we are now up and running at our new address . remember : those of you who post to linguist @ tamvm1 . tamu . edu can continue to use that address . but those of you who used to post to linguist @ tamsun . tamu . edu must change either to the . . . tamvm1 address or to linguist @ tam2000 . tamu . edu the latter is our new editorial address . the . . . tamsun address is now worse than useless : the machine itself has been taken off line by texas a&m , so any messages sent there will simply disappear into an internet black hole . they will not be forwarded to us . the new year 's issues start with this issue : 6 . 1 . however , the listserv swallowed some of the issues we posted on dec . 20 and is just now sending them out . so you probably received some issues of volume 5 ( 1994 ) only today . this is not what we intended - - indeed , we worked hard to clear the mailer and post all the messages we had received before we shut down on dec 21 . we realize that some of them had deadlines . however , listserv malfunctions are simply not within our control . the texas a&m sysop took a long ( well-deserved ) ( and , we hope , energizing ) christmas vacation . and , until his return , the listserv would not free the issues we had posted . and that , by a lightening transition , brings us to a few remarks on maintaining free discussion on linguist . as linguist grows , it becomes potentially more powerful - - some might say "" threatening "" - - by virtue of its role as an information source . it 's natural that controversial policies and postings should generate concern ; and last year we received a number of complaints , protests , and editorial suggestions . we tried to respond to every message individually ; but we 'd also like to publicly explain our policies and our current thinking about some of the issues that arose . if any of you care to respond , we can continue this discusson on linguist . * we received several requests that we check the accuracy of controversial claims and allegations before we post them . however reasonable this sounds , unfortunately it simply is n't possible . linguist processes 50-70 messages a day ; last year we assembled and posted 1600 issues ( as those of you with overfull mailboxes know ! ) ; and we get over 1000 database requests a week , about 1 / 4 of which require some kind of administrative interchange . we ask our 3 student editors to check messages for civility ( more on this below ) ; but they do n't have time to check anything which is not immediately before them on the screen . so there is no way that we can strive for the standards of accuracy of paper journals . and , of course , we aren ' t a journal ; we ' re a discussion list . the only effective check on the accuracy of any posting is the discussion itself . so the moral is : - - read with a little scepticism - - and , if you see an inaccuracy , post a correction * the preceding applies , of course , to _ professional _ content in postings ; we can't be responsible for the accuracy of anyone 's claims about the number of words for "" snow .

"Here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with 
no reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to 
be that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la 
Wilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, 
ev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more 
partners than women.  I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether 
the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely 
promiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get 
even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other 
men. 
http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html<>
As for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme 
promiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the 
Band Played On. He writes about  bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses 
how, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you 
might call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having 
many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an 
explicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.
    That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of 
Schiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played 
in spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many 
others. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that 
there was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.Tom

'thread manager'. do the number of processes accumulate? or is it 
just that the # of threads is == # of threads you're expecting + 1? 
if the latter, ttbomk that is normal.ie, you dont create the thread until the accept() returns. so up 
until then its a normal programme (ie no thread manager). after that 
you will always have +1 processes (for the thread manager).also, the stack for further threads is allocated from the heap. (see
sigaltstack() ) possibly glibc does not brk() back the space, just
like malloc()/free() does not always release the space to the heap
again (as most programmes will allocate memory / threads again
soonish anyway).> Regards,

"Could anyone who is interested clarify this for me.
Or point me in the direction of a site that does GPL case studies where there may be a similar issue. I have had a google around and the PHP site wasn't help full and the GPL page didn't seem to have this senario.The setup is as follows:
I develop a piece of code using PHP 3.0.9 which is, to
my knowledge, GPL. The piece of code runs on my server and is an integral part of a system that I have developed for a client. I did not recieve  payment for this particular piece of code but I did recieve payment for the system. My client now wants to  
use a different service provider but keep my code. 
Do I have a right to claim intellectual property rights for  my little piece of code that he did not pay me for or do I have to give the client the code under the GPL.I know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciatedAnt--

ASK THE FOOLQ. I'M TIRED OF GETTING SO MANY CREDIT CARD OFFERS IN THE MAIL. 
I ALREADY HAVE 
A CARD AND I DON'T WANT ANY MORE MAIL OFFERING ME NEW ONES. HOW 
CAN I STOP IT? A. There are three main credit bureaus in the United States, and 
they've agreed that if someone contacts one of them and asks to

telemarketing phone lists, they'll all honor the request. Full Answer:

YOUR MONEY RESOLUTIONS YOU CAN KEEP
Let's face it, New Year's resolutions are mostly nightmares that 
hang over our heads like that dark cloud that follows Eeyore 
everywhere he goes. We mostly fail to keep our resolutions 
because they are too vague and imply guilt-inducing judgment. 1. 
Live every moment. 2. Be a good person. 3. Lose a lot of weight. 
No pressure. Right? Wrong. 
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=562070Don't despair. We've put together a quick, proactive to-do list 
that is actually doable. This year's resolution: Save big bucks 
now and live comfortably in the future. Now that's a resolution 
you can get behind. Let's get started! 1. DIAL AWAY YOUR DEBT 
It's true. You can lower your credit card interest rates with 
one phone call.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562071 2. GET MORE FROM YOUR SAVINGS
Don't stash your short-term cash savings under your mattress. 
Earn higher yields on CDs, money markets, and more. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=5620723. INVEST FOR LESS 
Make sure your broker isn't charging you too much. Compare rates 
and hire a new one in only 60 seconds. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=5620734. RETIRE EARLY
Thanks to recent tax law changes, you can start pitching in more

When interest rates drop, some homeowners have the opportunity

SPOTLIGHTSHOULD ALL MY SAVINGS BE IN THE MARKET?
Um, no. We are big supporters of the idea that all of your long-term 
money should be in the stock market. But over the short term, 
the market is too volatile. Buying stocks for short-term gain is 
really speculating, not investing. Would you have wanted to have 
your emergency fund, or your house down payment, or your kid's 
tuition in the Nasdaq at its height on March 10, 2000? If you 
can't afford or wait out a 30% drop in the value of your 
savings, keep it out of the market.Of course, we're not just going to leave you hanging. To figure 
out the best place to keep your short-term savings, visit our 
nifty Savings Center.

COMMUNITY TIPSDO (AT LEAST) ONE THING DIFFERENTLY
Folks on the Living Below Your Means discussion board have been 
sharing at least one thing they are going to do differently in 
2002 to save money. -I am going to make sure I carry my coupon envelope in my purse 
 so I don't find myself at the grocery store buying a bunch of 
 stuff on which I could save a bunch of money if I hadn't left my 
 coupons at home. -Make sure I get reimbursed for every dime my company owes me. I 
 have a bad habit of not filing expense reports for little stuff, 
 like 10 miles of mileage to go to a mediation. Ten miles is 
 $3.10 and if I do that 10 times a year, that's more than 30 
 bucks, and definitely worth filing an expense report for. -I'm going to make at least one crock-pot meal a week so I don't 
 get tempted to go out and buy something to eat. Fridays would be 
 a great time to do this. -Either cut down on the long-distance phone calls, or else find 
 a cheaper long-distance plan.-Document everything that I give to charity, including the 
 clothes and books, so that I can deduct it from my taxes. -Keep turning down the thermostat at night and when I leave the 
 house. Run my humidifier (moist air is cheaper to heat). Have any tips of your own? Add to the growing list here.

There are a number of reasons to think that CO2 is not important to
controlling global temperature and that much of the CO2 increase may not
be anthropogenic. Some recent research points worth mentioning:Recent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and
temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest
correlation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases
are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the
increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature
preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done
of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are
correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly
causative. There is a lot of evidence that CO2 levels are regulated in a
fairly stable fashion.  I don't believe anyone really has an
authoritative answer as to exactly how this works yet.With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to
point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly
regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.  At previous cycle
peaks, the concentrations were similar to what they are now.  If this
cycle has any validity (and we only have good data for 4-5 complete
cyclical periods, but which look surprisingly regular in shape and
time), then we should be almost exactly at a peak right now.  As it
happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous
cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. In other
words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, but it looks a lot like we
would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical
record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2
concentrations.Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately
affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely
predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative
feedback systems mentioned above.Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it
makes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and
methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule
basis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something
that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the
biosphere.CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent
studies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a
passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.  I certainly don't
think it is a healthy fixation if we're actually interested in
understanding warming trends.Cheers,-James Rogers

co-workers. Updating my Gnome components has fixed it for me and
others, although I can't say exactly which component did the
trick. Gnomecore or gtk would seem most likely, but it may have been
something else.In any case, I have not seen the problem for quite a while, now.R. Kevin Oberman, Network Engineer

"Hello again. I tried all the suggestions for the PCTel driver and at the end of it, everything still goes smoothly until I type ""make"" after I get the output from the ./configure. However, there were a couple of things I noticed along the way. After typing 
* cp configs/kernel-2.4...config .config
* make oldconfig
* make dep
The 2nd to last line I got back said that the modversions.h file was not updated. When I looked at this path to the modversions.h file, it was 281 lines and every line started with a # mark. Is it the case that nothing is read on a line after a # mark (or am I just thinking of another language?) and so should I delete the # at certain places?Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed ""make"", I noticed that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h file. Inside this other file, there's nothing at all. And so I moved the modversions.h file with 281 lines to the empty modversions.h file - and got a different reply after ""make"". The output after I moved the file over mostly looked like this:
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:11:33: linux/modules/adb.ver: No such file or directory
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:12:37: linux/modules/af_ax25.ver: No such file or directory
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:13:36: linux/modules/af_ipx.ver: No such file or directoryThe odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are what's written after the # in the modversions.h file. Should there be a file at each of these (one at each of the 281 lines of the file) that I'd have to compile/make?It's taken plenty of elbow grease, but I'm glad it hasn't gone smoothly, it's a good learning experience. Again, any help is appreciated. Thanks, Eric_____________________________________________________________

"" questions were raised last week on wall street after the company announced a write - down of more than $ 1 billion due to failed investments in telecoms and other businesses . the disclosure alarmed investors and sent the already battered shares down 23 pc . yesterday they fell another $ 5 . 30 ( # 3 . 80 ) to $ 20 . 75 in early trading . according to the annual report the "" related party transactions "" , as enron describes them , took place in 1999 and 2000 , resulting in losses of $ 16 m and $ 36 m respectively . mr lay said that auditors approved the deals , but would not give further details of what they were . they are understood to have been hedging transactions against enron shares and other assets made by partnerships called ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment jp . "" we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done , "" added mr lay . the relationship between the investment losses and the sec probe is not clear , though the inquiry seems to focus on the partnerships responsible for the hedging transactions . enron owns teesside power station and wessex water in britain and is the largest trader of natural gas in the us . investors are concerned that the probe and the continued uncertainty about the extent of the problem will harm the company ' s credit rating . an enron spokesman said mr fastow continues to work and is not under any suspicion . the sec inquiry is "" informal "" , says the company . the watchdog contacted enron last wednesday , the day of the results announcement . the sec declined to comment . enron made a loss of $ 638 m in the third quarter , its first in over four years . copyright ? 2000 dow jones financial desk shares of enron plummet 21 % energy : sec requests information from company on series of unusual financial deals tied to executive . nancy rivera brooks times staff writer 10 / 23 / 2001 los angeles times home edition c - 1 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company shares of enron corp . set a 52 - week low monday on word that the securities and exchange commission had asked for information about a complex series of financial transactions between the houston - based energy giant and an investment partnership tied to a company executive . enron , the world ' s largest energy trader , said it had voluntarily provided information on "" certain related - party transactions "" that had been previously disclosed to the sec . "" we welcome this request , "" said kenneth l . lay , enron chairman and chief executive . "" we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest , "" he said . the sec request is the latest in a parade of bad news for enron , which has seen investments sour in telecommunications , retail electricity sales and water . investors have battered the company ' s stock , which once sold for nearly $ 85 a share in the last year , and many have criticized enron ' s stingy meting out of financial information . but several wall street analysts remain upbeat on the stock , noting that the bulk of its businesses continue to thrive despite the growing economic downturn . in august , enron chief executive jeffrey k . skilling , one of the main architects of the company ' s strategy of shedding physical assets in search of trading profit , stunned wall street by resigning . skilling cited personal , family - related reasons , but later he acknowledged that the precipitous plunge in the company ' s stock price contributed to his departure . on monday , enron shares plunged $ 5 . 40 , or nearly 21 % , to close at $ 20 . 65 on the new york stock exchange . enron ' s stock has lost nearly 40 % of its value in the last week since it reported a surprise third - quarter loss of $ 618 million after $ 1 . 01 billion in charges reflecting the costs of recent failed investments . but the charge also included $ 35 million related to what enron described only as the "" early termination during the third quarter of certain structured finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity . "" in a conference call with securities analysts about the earnings , the company mentioned that it had repurchased 55 million shares as part of the dissolution of its participation in the transactions . but investors were stunned when stories last week in the wall street journal detailed that the transactions were with a limited partnership organized by andrew s . fastow , enron ' s chief financial officer , and that enron had whittled $ 1 . 2 billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a $ 1 . 2 - billion note it had received from the partnership . shareholder equity now stands at $ 9 . 5 billion . the limited partnership , called ljm 2 , and fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved enron assets and stock , the journal reported . lay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed . a shareholder lawsuit charging that enron ' s directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in texas state court . many companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes , but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them , analyst say . investors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that enron has guarded financial information , making it difficult to analyze the company ' s complex web of businesses . and many are not confident that all the bad news has been released . analyst m . carol coale , who follows enron and other energy companies for prudential securities in houston , downgraded enron to a "" hold "" from a "" buy "" rating monday out of such frustration . coale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of enron . but bob christensen , energy analyst with first albany corp . , said that despite enron ' s recent difficulties , the bulk of the business remains strong .

XrayMedia
(OTCBB: XRMD) Alert Rating = 8Congratulations to our subscribers who moved in fast on our last report! Pick #1 - Internet incubator giant CMGI has paid off very well, up over 150% on major volume and great news.Pick #2 - ENBC Began its' heavy move up over 200% hitting a high of over 300%... Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing itsÂ’ technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weÂ’ve never seen anything like it!How does the company do this? XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a ""mass source to advertising sector "" live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the companyÂ’sÂ’ strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the usersÂ’ criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. Their ""source to business model"", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.While investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon. *** Listed on the OTCBB and trading with an extremely low market valuation under 10 mm.*** It has opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers including some of the largest media buyers in the world, major retailers and smaller retailers. *** Attracting interest of major investment bankers and analysts, also a possible acquisition target at some point by major retailers.*** Received largest order of advertising financing over $500k with more contracts accumulating.*** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic $1mm to $5mm. *** The company is expected to report a profitable quarter, to grow revenues and earnings ""substantially"" when it begins its 2003 fiscal year in January.

The Poles noticed that there were some patterns in the messages which were only possible via certain plugboard settings, and so:> When we have collected several such cards corresponding to different > initial signals ..., we place them in a pile so that the squares > corresponding to the same daily settings are aligned and shine a > light beneath the pile.

"special issue of cl journal - finite state methods in nlp call for papers computational linguistics special issue on finite state methods in natural language processing recent years has seen a substantial increase in the use of finite state techniques in many aspects of natural language processing as mature tools for building large scale finite-state systems from various research laboratories and universities become available . this trend was by no means foreseen as late as ten years ago given the well-known demonstration by noam chomsky in 1957 that finite-state methods are inherently incapable of representing the full richness of constructions in a natural language . nevertheless , it is evident now that there are many subsets of natural language that are adequately covered by finite-state means and that there are many other areas where finite-state approximations of more powerful formalisms are of great practical benefit . as a follow-up to the fsmnlp ' 98 , international workshop on finite state methods in natural language processing , it was proposed that a collection of papers in this area be published as a special issue of the computational linguistics journal . we would to encourage authors of the papers presented at this workshop , as well as all others who would like to contribute , to submit full versions of their papers for consideration for this special issue . guest editors : lauri karttunen ( xerox research centre europe , france ) kemal oflazer ( bilkent university , turkey ) guest editorial board eric brill ( johns hopkins university , md , usa ) eva ejerhed ( umea university , sweden ) ronald m . kaplan ( xerox palo alto research center , ca , usa ) martin kay ( xerox palo alto research center , ca , usa ) george kiraz ( bell laboratories , nj , usa ) andrs kornai ( bbn , ma , usa ) mehryar mohri ( at&t labs research , nj , usa ) mark - jan nederhof ( dfki , germany ) atro voutilainen ( university of helsinki , finland ) submission details please submit 6 copies of your hard-copy manuscript to lauri karttunen xerox research centre europe 6 chemin de maupertuis meylan , 38240 , france by monday , october 19 , 1998 . the format of the submission should follow the general submission requirements of the journal . manuscripts for computational linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper ( 8 . 5 by 11 inches , or a4 ) , double-spaced throughout , including footnotes and references . the paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words . manuscripts must be written in english .",Safe Email

"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46455-2002Oct5.htmlA New Theory on Mapping the New WorldBy Guy Gugliotta
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, October 7, 2002; Page A07In 1507, a group of scholars working in France produced an extraordinary map
of the world, the first to put the still-recent discoveries of Columbus and
others into a new continent separate from Asia, and to call that continent
""America."" With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born.
But there was something else. What would later come to be called South
America and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on the
east coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast
-- which no European was known to have seen.
The ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of
modern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right
geographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed
along its top.
The shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the
curvature of the Earth.
It is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12
large printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was
published six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus of
Panama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around the
world.

based forum for interaction among all theoreticians and practitioners interested in data mining . interdisciplinary collaboration is one desired outcome , but the main long-term focus is on theoretical principles for the emerging discipline of kdd , especially on kdd - specific principles that go beyond each contributing area . both theoretical and applied submissions are sought . reviewers will assess the contribution towards the principles of kdd , in addition to the usual requirements of relevance , novelty , clarity and significance . applied papers should go beyond an individual application , presenting an explicit method that promises a degree of generality within one or more stages of the discovery process , such as preprocessing , mining , visualization , use of prior knowledge , knowledge refinement , and evaluation . theoretical papers should demonstrate how the proposed theoretical contribution advances the discovery process . the following non-exclusive list exemplifies topics of interest : data and knowledge representation for data mining * beyond relational databases : new forms of data organization * data reduction * prior domain knowledge and use of discovered knowledge * combining query systems with discovery capabilities statistics and probability in data mining * discovery of probabilistic networks * modelling knowledge uncertainty * discovery of exceptions and deviations * statistical significance in large-scale search * the problems of over-fit logic -

"grammatical relations and derived notions about two months ago i posted a query which , somewhat abbreviated , ran as follows : "" for some time , i have been puzzled by a claim that i come across frequently in the formal grammatical literature , namely that since grammatical relations are derived , therefore they cannot be referred to by the grammar . more specifically , my puzzlement is not concerned with why some people believe both that grammatical relations are derived and that grammatical relations cannot be referred to by the grammar , but rather with why they think the second belief follows necessarily from the first . i would be grateful for any enlightenment on this issue . "" my query did n't elicit a vast number of responses , so maybe i should conclude that people are n't really interested in this issue , but for those who might be interested i will summarize the responses . first , no one defended the position that i criticized . indeed , the general tenor , explicit or implicit , of the responses is that the position is erroneous . i am thus inclined to continue believing that it is an error that has unfortunately crept into the literature , one which i hope will disappear . some people pointed to other specific examples in linguistics and other sciences where derived notions play a crucial role , making it meaningful to argue about what are the correct derived notions . second , some people suggested that those who appear to make the claim in question might really be trying to say something different ( e . g . simply that the grammar should not refer directly to grammatical relations ) . but examination of the two most recent instances that i encountered , and which prompted me to post the query , shows that they only make sense if the claim is interpreted literally as i suggested . third , some people asked me to cite references to where the claim is made . i prefer not to do so . ( 1 ) it is n't my aim to embarrass anyone in front of the whole list ; there are others who are much better at that than i am . ( 2 ) it would be unfair to the authors of the two instances that i encountered most recently and which i remember - - i do n't see why i should cite them , especially as they are linguists whose work i respect - - while those i happen not to remember go uncited . i will be happy if the erroneous claim does n't appear in future . i am grateful to the following for their responses : dan finer , f . lehman , adam meyers , fritz newmeyer , sebastian shaumyan , jean - roger vergnaud . bernard comrie ( comrie @ bcf . usc . edu ) bernard comrie dept of linguistics gfs-301 tel + 1 213 740 2986 university of southern california fax + 1 213 740 9306 los angeles , ca 90089-1693 , usa e-mail comrie @ bcf . usc . edu",Safe Email

"obligatory affixes : summary several weeks ago i asked how the traditional notion of obligatory affixes was recast in the theory of realizational morphology . the responce was not exactly overwhelming , but i wish to thank greg stump ( eng101 @ ukcc . uky . edu ) , don ringe ( dringe @ unagi . cis . upenn . edu ) , r . beard ( rbeard @ coral . bucknell . edu ) , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy ( a . c-mcc @ ling . canterbury . ac . nz ) for helpful responses . a few responses ( slightly edited ) : greg stump : in paradigm function theory , a language 's inventory of morphosyntactic features is assumed to determine - - for any major syntactic category x - - a paradigm schema : a set of cells each of which is associated with a complete and fully specified set of morphosyntactic feature specifications appropriate to category x . in latin , for example , the features of case ( i . e . nominative , genitive , dative , accusative , ablative ) , number ( singular , plural ) , and gender ( masculine , feminine , neuter ) determine a paradigm schema for adjectives which consists of thirty cells , one for each of the case / number / gender combinations for which adjectives may be inflected . an adjective 's paradigm is then viewed as the inventory of inflected forms assigned to these cells . for any given cell c in the adjectival paradigm schema , there is a corresponding paradigm function which applies to an adjectival lexeme l to yield the inflected form of l assigned to c . paradigm functions are defined in terms of more specific morphological rules , including rules of exponence and rules of referral ; two or more of these may come into competition in the evaluation of a given paradigm function , in which case the narrower rule overrides the more general . how , then , is the notion of obligatory affixes recast in this theory ? notice first that the architecture of the theory guarantees that every inflected word w of category x will be associated with a complete and fully specified set of morphosyntactic feature specifications appropriate to x , and that it is this set of specifications that drives the inflection of w . in other words , it is the morphology , not ( pace anderson ) the syntax , that ` ensures that any given word has all the features required by the affixes in question ' . ( naturally , i assume that a lexeme 's invariant feature specifications - - e . g . a noun 's gender - - are simply supplied by its lexical entry . ) second , if a particular affix position must be filled , then that position can be assumed to be associated with a set of rules of affixal exponence the least narrow of which functions as the default for that position . [ i have some questions about how that works where the choice of one affix seems to require the presence of morphosyntactic features which are otherwise absent , but it may be that all such examples could be reanalyzed . it would be unfair of me to say more until i ' ve had a chance to correspond with greg . - - mm ] [ some references : ] ` a paradigm-based theory of morphosemantic mismatches ' , _ language _ 67 ( 1991 ) , 675-725 . ` on the theoretical status of position class restrictions on inflectional affixes ' , in _ yearbook of morphology 1991 _ , ed . by geert booij and jaap van marle , 211-241 .

web to speak of, but you'd think a 400km gash in the Earth would be
pretty easy to find ;) I remember it from an issue perhaps in the very
late 80's or early 90's.It's interesting to note that NT7 and many other NEO bodies are all on
trajectories that approach the Earth from under the ecliptic, so with
the Earth tilt, South America becomes a pretty good target.  In trying
to find you a site through Google, I turned up several different
impact sites in Venezuela and Brazil, with ages ranging from 251M to
70 years, but not the 400km gash from the above story.  The only google refs I found from that period is one in Arizona
(famous impact crater) and another in NM; do wish I had noted the
actual South American /country/ that contains the scar; Venezuela
sticks in my mind but I can't be certain.  http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/images/meteorcrater.html--

  | From: ""Matthew French"" 
  |[ ... ]
  | Now here is a thought: a Unix version of the ""Deleted Items"" folder.
  | 
  | In the root of a hard drive, create a directory "".unwanted"".
  | Then periodically create hard links to every file on the hard
  | drive that does not have hard links.
  | 
  | That way, when someone accidentally does ""rm *"" or whatever,
  | you still have a link under "".unwanted""  [ ... ] hum.  interesting variation on the classic technique of
 redefining `rm' to `mv' the files into `./.trash/' (or
 with a prefix of `#' or a suffix of `~'; the variations
 are endless).  these classic techniques only provide a
 means to roll back accidental `rm's, so there is still
 considerable scope for data lost as there are other ways
 of deleting files --- which is not a problem for this
 hard link idea. but, like the classic techniques, there is no rolling
 back of accidental overwrites. ( rolling back overwrites reminds me of the ""snapshot""
  facility on NetWork Appliance fileservers.  and of the
  various ""versioning"" filesystems which appeared --- and
  then vanished? --- over the years.... ) one severe(?) gotcha is some files shouldn't have any
 hard links.  both RCS *,v (and hence CVS) and SCCS s.*
 files are like this --- the RCS(/CVS?)/SCCS toolsets
 complain if there are hard links.cheers,

"URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85443841
Date: Not suppliedBug 22056 has to do with enabling different toolbar modes. It's a pretty basic 
browser feature that has been missing from Navigator for years. Even simplified 
browsers like Chimera have this feature. Neil did some excellent work in 22056 
and his code finally landed. It naturally spiked startup time and window time 
slightly, and so it ended up being backed out because of Mozilla's no tolerance 
policy for regressions.While this ""line in the sand"" policy is in many ways a good one, I feel like it 
misses the point. There is a natural tendency when designing applications to 
add features in every new version of the software. Only rarely do you see 
features removed. With each passing version, you get more and more bloated, 
relying on faster machines and more memory to save the day. Who cares if the 
user interface is now full of 3000 menu items? You still support every last 
feature since version 1.0, so no customers can possibly be dissatisfied!You can really only cram so many features into a product before its size 
requirements and performance requirements have to change. This is an obvious 
rule. It's like you start with an empty elevator that says ""Capacity: 10 
people."" The elevator stops at the first floor (version 1.0) and a bunch of 
people (features) get on. Continuing on its journey, the elevator stops at the 
second floor, and still more people get on. The elevator is now full, and it 
continues to the third floor (version 3.0). Unfortunately the elevator is full, 
but there are a bunch of people waiting at the third floor to get on. Some of 
them squeeze in anyway, past the fat person from the first floor (the Mozilla 
sidebar feature) who is taking up enough space for 3 people. Everyone wishes 
he'd get off at the third floor or even the fourth floor, but he doesn't. 
Someone (the Mozilla wallet feature) from the second floor cuts one on the way 
to the third floor, so he's useless, and everyone wishes he'd get off too. He 
doesn't though. Nobody does. People keep piling in at floor after floor, until 
eventually the elevator support cable snaps and everybody dies.We need to forcibly eject people from the elevator. Remove the features that 
nobody wants and replace them with the features that matter. Cull out the 
features that didn't work in Mozilla 1.0 and make sure they aren't there in 
Mozilla 2.0. Make more of the features optional plugins so that geeks who want 
some of the more obscure features (and that have powerhouse machines) can go 
download them on their own. Only if we actively fight the trend towards bloat 
will we finally produce an awesome Mozilla browser.

( copyrighted fonts would have to be purchased from the source . ) others could do the same with "" their "" languages . often , when writing papers , and quoting the works of others , i need to write using a non-standard font , so i need to make it myself , then go back to my writing . i have n't counted them , but i have a bunch of partial fonts for many languages , both orthography and ipa . however , these partially completed fonts are based on books written as far back as the 1800s . i seriously doubt that they represent current writing systems . i do n't want to step on anybody 's toes , but i can develop a font for any language out there . i can do both truetype and postscript fonts for both the pc and macs . however , if somebody else has already done the work , it makes sense to use their fonts . why re-invent the wheel ? as far as naming the fonts i ' ve created , i ' ve been using the three-letter language codes from _ ethnologue : languages of the world _ , ed . barbara f . grimes , 12th ed . , 1992 . for example , my cahuilla orthography is c-chl . ttf ( truetype for pc ) , and my cahuilla ipa is c-chl - p . ttf . i recently responded to jan tent 's posting about yesterday , today , and tomorrow words . i sent her words in north american indian languages . she wrote back asking about some of the symbols i had used . if a common font set was available , i could have e-mailed her a font for her computer , and she could have read my reply with the native orthography and ipa pronunciations in the document i sent . to me , it seems that this would be useful to people . i 'd like to hear others ' opinions about such a project ( in addition to where to ftp or buy fonts ) . i would especially like to hear from the indigenous language speakers on this list , in addition to the linguists . so send me your information and opinions , even if the opinion is , "" chuck , you ' re an idiot . scrap the whole idea . "" i ' ll post a summary to the list if there 's enough interest , otherwise i ' ll respond personally . if you need a font for a language you ' re working on , let me know that , too . happy holidays , chuck coker work : ( 909 ) 882-2099 ( united states ) home : ( 909 ) 886-5035 ( united states ) e-mail : cjcoker @ csupomona . edu = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = there have been no dragons in my life , only small spiders and stepping in gum . i could have coped with the dragons . - - anonymous ( but wise )",Safe Email

One thing I _think_ you might be doing slightly wrong is your
specification of prefixes.  --prefix is the directory to be used as root
for _installing_ files.  Typically packages use /usr/local as default
(so binaries might then go in /usr/local/bin, documentation in
/usr/local/doc and so forth).
Normally, I find it sufficient to put --prefix=/usr/local, and do not
further specify things like --exec-prefix.Maybe you have a special reason for using the prefixes you chose, in
which case ignore me!

I'd make the same remarks about prefixes here.  I would use the command
    ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/localTo get w3 to compile, I think the with-url flag you should use is
    --with-url=/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/
(Assuming you compiled/installed url with --prefix=/usr/local
Since you appear to have installed url in /url/url, configure w3 with
./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/ --with-url=/url/url/share/emacs/site-lispA command you would have found useful would have been
    find / -name 'url-vars.el' -print
Which would have told you where the url-vars.el file was installed.A program which is very useful is checkinstall
http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/
It allows you to install packages from source while still registering
them in the package management system of your distro (rpm,deb,tgz).
Instead of ""make install"" type ""checkinstall"", and a package is put
together and installed for you.  Makes uninstallation simpler than it
might otherwise be.

"towards culturally situated agents * * * call for papers and participation * * * issues in cross cultural communication "" towards culturally situated agents "" http : / / www . nttmsc . com . my / kido / pricai98cfp . html 24th of november 1998 , singapore introduction culture underlies every aspect of social behavior and influences communication style , personality , character , motivation , knowledge and cognition . there is an extensive body of work on cross-cultural differences in communication styles in the linguistics and cultural anthropology literature . in the intelligent user interface design community , over the years , fueled by the recognition that different types of users are motivated by different needs and goals , attention has been given to the development of adaptive user interfaces . however , this line of research and development has given little consideration to the influence that culture plays in shaping what users want out of the computational experience . in order to create interfaces that accommodate different user styles , therefore , it is important to understand these cultural influences , since , in many cases , a user will react to interfaces on the basis of cultural background . similarly , if we are to view an agent , software or robot as a social member of a "" cyber society , "" then that agent must be able to invoke cultural knowledge in order to communicate flexibly with human users and possibly other agents . if agents are reflective only of their designers ' communicative behaviors and are not able to adapt to the styles of other agents which they meet in heterogeneous , distributed environments and virtual reality worlds , then our agents may be trapped in a tower of babel . the goal of this workshop is to discuss cultural influences as they ( may ) inform interactions among human and software agents . this workshop is intended to attract participants from those communities concerned with such a perspective of communication . topics of interest the workshop aims to be interdisciplinary in nature and is therefore open to contributions from various research fields . the topics which the workshop addresses are relevant , for instance , in : anthropology , sociology , sociolinguistics , human computer interaction ( hci ) , cscw , machine learning , adaptive systems research , collaborative virtual environments , multi-media multi-user environments , ethnology , social sciences , psychology and cognitive science . the scope of this workshop includes , but need not be restricted to the following topics : * the nature of cross cultural communication , including case studies and examples * the origin and evolution of communication * linguistic and ethnographic studies of cross cultural communication * negotiation strategies among humans from different cultural backgrounds * negotiation strategies among agents informed by different cultural principles * user interfaces and new media for cross cultural communication * the impact of internet technology on cross cultural communication * culturally situated metaphors in interface , machine and agent design * ethnomethodology in interface and agent design * culturally dependent metaphors and language of describing and talking about humans , machines and agents : influences on the design process , theory / model building , and scientific experimentation * case studies of program execution problems due to agent to agent and human to agent miscommunication * standards which are open to the development of multiple ontologies of mult iagent communication in heterogeneous environments * working examples of culturally adaptive agents in multiagent or human-agent systems papers should address these topics in the context of how they relate to issues in agent design and agent behavior . participation and submission of papers the workshop will comprise a few keynote talks , a panel discussion with participants from different research areas and presentations of preliminary findings by workshop participants . participants will be selected by the organizing committee ( see below ) based on submitted papers . potential participants who wish to present their work at the workshop should submit a short paper ( up to 5 , 000 words ) or extended abstract ( 1 , 500 to 2 , 500 words ) . contributions should describe work in progress , completed work , positions , or give significant insight into the issues on cross cultural communication . other potential participants should send a statement of interest ( one page ) , briefly describing their work and their interest in the workshop . some of the participants will be asked to contribute a paper to the final working notes . all participants will be invited to bring a poster presenting their work . submissions should be sent by e-mail ( ascii , unix compatible postscript , or rtf ) to the workshop chair , takashi kido ,

"all, Firstly I'd like to thank all of you for the fast and very helpful feedback that I got to my question today. I have one more question though. I downloaded the w3 and url files from the server at the first try thanks to the help that I received today. Then though I tried to build them. I started by trying the w3 program. I used the following lines which produced some strange results. Would any one be able to set me straight?./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/src/beta/w3 --exec-prefix=/usr/ local/src/beta/w3 --with-url=/url/url That worked fine so I moved to the next step. make At the bottem of the text I got the following messages: Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el make[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255 make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp' make: *** [w3] Error 2When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems. In saying that this doesn't necessarily mean that I was doing it right so below are the commands I used. ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/url/url --exec-prefix=/url/url followed by the commands make and make install. There is no text files which contain help on installing the url package so I'm not completely certain if I've used the right method here.Thanks againDarragh ----- Original Message ----- From: ""Hunt, Bryan"" To: ; Cc: Sent: Thursday, September 05, 2002 5:08 PM Subject: OT: RE: [ILUG] Newby to Linux looking for information on cvs > > speaking of that IDE (weblogic developer) the open source version called > eclipse is free from eclipse.org If you are doing java development you > need to get this IDE .

instead of a system alias; more secure, and easier to filter out crud

extending the set of typical classes of ml problems to other hard cases ( particularly dense in the nlp processes ) ; adding inductive capabilities to nlp system for tasks related to specific applications ( i . e . information extraction ) . the proposed workshop is thus aiming to stimulate reasearch and discussion on the following aspects : - establishing results and evidencies on the suitability of different ml paradigms on specific levels of representation of lexical knowledge ( morphology , syntax , linguistic inference among others ) - comparison of the quantitative approaches to lexical acquisition with empirical symbolic methods - stimulating discussion on cognitive perspective of some models within a plausible architecture for language processing and learning - establishing results on the applicability of the extracted / induce knowledge within nlp systems , with respect to assessed evaluation criteria , typical of the ml and language engineering ( le ) area - case studies on adaptive nlp systems , i . e . effective nlp systems integrating linguistic inferences with inductive capabilities ( www kb at cmu , ecran ) , - critical review of existing experiences on adaptive nlp systems - establishing guidelines for an evaluation framework of adaptive nlp systems : accuracy of the linguistic process , robustness of the induction process , . . . - promote cooperation among research groups in europe and usa to exchange ideas , data and tools for design and experiment architectures for adaptive nlp systems workshop format : the workshop is expected to cover the whole day . in the first session , a part from an invited talk , we expect to cover methodological issues . papers related to advanced research on suitability of learning paradigms for the different target lexical information will be favoured . prototypical examples in this area are studies on empirical learning of tasks like pos tagging , induction of grammatical information , symbolic learning of word sense disambiguation criteria and lexical semantic information . a panel discussion is expected to close the morning session and focus on principles of suitability for learning paradigms vs . lexical levels . in the second half of the day we expect to stimulate partecipants to cover application areas , like ir and ie , by a couple of invited talks on existing adaptive systems as a basis for presenting novel aspects on integration of nlp capabilities with learning from experience ( examples , errors , performance ) . a set of at least other 3 or 4 papers is expected to concentrate on original research works that we know are currently under development in several reasearch centres in europe ( sheffield university , tilburg , rome tor vergata and torino university ) . a panel discussion on the implication of the adaptive paradigm on existing and potential nlp systems will close the workshop . program committee r . basili ( university of roma , tor vergata , italy ) m . craven ( carnegie mellon university , usa ) w . daelemans ( university of tilburg , nederlands ) m . t . pazienza ( university of roma , tor vergata , italy ) l . saitta ( university of torino , italy ) c . samuelssonn ( bell labs , at&t , usa ) y . wilks ( university of sheffield , uk ) paper submission : = = = = = = = = = = = = papers should not exceed 3000 words or 6 pages hard copy submission : three copies of the paper should be sent to : roberto basili department of computer science , systems and production university of roma , tor vergata via di tor vergata 00133 roma ( italy ) e-mail : basili @ info . utovrm . it electronic submission : electronic submission may be in either self-contained postscript or rtf formats , to basili @ info . utovrm . it for each submission - - whether hard copy or electronic - - a separate plain ascii text email message should be sent to roberto basili , containing the following information : # name : name of first author # title : title of the paper # pages : number of pages # files : name of file ( if attachments are submitted electronically ) # note : any relevant instructions # keys : keywords # email : email of the first author # abstr : abstract of the paper . . . . . . timetable : workshop announcement and call for papers : 5 january 1998 papers due : 15 february 1998 notification of acceptance : 5 march 1998 final version due : 25 march 1998 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - roberto basili department of computer science , systems and production university of roma , tor vergata via di tor vergata 00133 roma ( italy ) e-mail : basili @ info . utovrm . it tel : + 39 - 6 - 7259 7391 fax : + 39 - 6 - 7259 7460 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -",Safe Email

if you say you want a cat who looks like a PokÃ©mon.Why is that PokÃ©mon called ""Persian"", anyway - it looks nothing like a

Abyssinian.  If you want one of these breeds, I hope you're prepared

"organizational announcement - introducing enron engineering and operational services in order to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with the commercial businesses they support , we are pleased to announce the following organizational change will be effective immediately . a new business unit , enron engineering and operational services ( eeos ) , is being formed which will include our existing operations in enron engineering and construction company ( ee & cc ) , operational energy corporation ( oec ) , and national energy production corporation ( nepco ) . brian stanley , as president and chief executive officer , and keith dodson , as chief operating officer will provide the leadership for this new organization , reporting to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . nepco will continue to operate as a stand - alone business under john gillis , president . with the majority of ee & cc and oec  , s activities focused on assets and projects which are in wholesale services , this will better align the efforts of eeos with the commercial businesses it supports . while eeos will be a stand - alone unit within enron wholesale services it will work very closely with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports . this realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabilities in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will also allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation of resources to these projects . consistent with this approach , development engineering will have dual reporting to both eeos and the business units which they support . with an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wide variety of new development opportunities available to enron , it is critical that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design , construct , commission , and effectively manage and operate enron  , s assets on a global basis . this new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhance these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage as we advance our business strategy around the world . please join us in congratulating brian and keith on their new assignments . mark frevert & dave delainey",Safe Email

"Two interesting analyses of the Irish implementation of copyright as led by, as
best I can tell, anticipation of the EUCD (since the Irish law was passed in
2000, and the EUCD is somewhat more recent than that). The pieces of interest
are the papers by Prof. Robert Clark, who perhaps might not be a bad choice of
speaker for some future LUG gathering. One of the more eye-opening comments in
the second of his papers is that Irish legislation is, in effect, more
draconian than the DMCA.http://www.cai.ie/Past%20Events.html#2002There are some other interesting pieces here, too, for anyone concerned about
copyright and the like in Ireland.Cheers,

July 18, 2002 1:01 pm PTNO ONE KNOWS better than Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer that, as the .Net
platform evolves, the success of Microsoft depends on how well the
company coordinates its tool, server, and client strategies and how well
it communicates that vision. In an interview with InfoWorld Test Center
Director Steve Gillmor and InfoWorld Editor at Large Ed Scannell at
Microsoft Fusion 2002, Ballmer discussed the progress of .Net, changes
in the company's approach to product development, and Microsoft's
efforts to simplify product licensing and inspire trust in customers and
partners.> Last time we talked was two years ago, at the beginning of the .Net
> era. So where are we now in the .Net evolution?Let me start by talking about where I think we are in the XML revolution
first, and then [I will] talk about where we are with .Net. I believe
that the IT industry collectively decided over the last three or four
years that the world was going to be replatformed with XML as the key
foundation. It's not like anyone ever got together to decide this, but
it's like magnetic north, where it's been clearly indicated that
everyone is rallying around the concept. But I think the degree to which
[XML] is pervasive might still be underestimated. A lot of partners,
even at this conference, see it as b-to-b for big companies. But it is
really about the way software in general is designed. It is all about
the way security should work. Management -- everything is changed.So to answer your direct question, two years ago I might have said the
jury is still out about whether [XML] was going to happen. We were
questioning if it was going to be a legitimate competitor to Java. But
now the world has decided to embrace [XML] as the basis for the next
generation of technology. And there are a lot of benefits that come with
it. Could it have been something other than XML? Sure it could have. It
wasn't the specific technical implementation; it is merely the fact that
it comes out of Internet standards. It has deeper semantic abilities. It
is all about interoperability and connection.So in that context, where are we with .Net? I'll say a couple
things. No. 1, I would say we have some momentum in the market. We have
customers using the .Net product line, like Merrill [Lynch], Credit
Suisse, Marks & Spencer, CitiBank, and a variety of others. People who
are doing some things for real. I feel like the degree we are out front
is in some ways smaller and in some ways larger.> How so?Smaller in the sense that everyone is talking the XML talk, even Sun;
bigger in the execution sense: We've delivered. We delivered the first
batch of products that really were built XML to the core -- Visual
Studio .Net and BizTalk Server -- and we are getting traction. So I feel
good about where our execution is relative to everyone else. That is not
to say that other people aren't doing some reasonable bolt-on XML
support for the stuff they have.> You have some heavy lifting to do to convince your customers and
> partners to follow along. What do you have to do to set the standard
> for adoption and upgrading to this next generation?We have to present the picture that we are behaving consistently within
the framework of focusing on customer issues and customer satisfaction
and trustworthy computing, which we have articulated. Now there are some
things I would have done differently, in 20-20 hindsight. I would have
increased the focus on not just security but deployment, because a lot
of the security problems are actually deployment problems. We have the
fix, but sometimes we can't get the tools in their hands to deploy those
fixes fast enough. Licensing -- I know I would have given more time, and
there are better ways to plan around the kinds of changes we made. We
are still going to have to get smart about the full ramifications.> Do you expect any changes to be made between now and July 31 to
> Licensing 6.0? There is a lot of push-back on this.No, there is nothing that will happen between now and July 31. And we
will continue to learn over time what we need to do to earn our
customers' trust and earn their business. I think many of the people who
are pushing back really don't even know the new terms.> Isn't that your fault for not educating them?Yes, it is our fault. But you meet with plenty of customers whose
companies already have licenses, and they are saying, 'I think there's a
problem.' I don't deny there are some problems. I am sure there are some
issues we will have to work on over time.After July 31 we are going to see what the real issues are. I was
talking to a customer at the show who was saying he thought there would
be a problem, and I told him that we just completed a deal with his
company and that he is now universally licensed and that total costs to
his company are now lower than they were before. And he said, 'Oh really?'So we'll go through July 31. We have a lot of customers who have signed
licenses, and I am sure we are going to find some issues. My bigger
concerns today are probably not in the larger accounts, but there may be
some issues we need to address among the smaller-size companies, and we will.> How does the .Net initiative change the way in-house client and server
> developers work together? What we are trying to do for the health of .Net and the health of the
company and the sanity of the people who work there and the quality of
the products we produce is to have a more orchestrated, ï¿½ber-road map
of where we are going.Now there are two things a road map can be. One is just a piece of paper
that tells what everyone is doing and records a bunch of bottom-up
plans. Or it can be something where we impose more broadly our vision
from the top. We are not going to try to get everything shared. ...
That's a path for getting everything stopped up. But at the same time we
are trying to take the top four or five things we are trying to do in
the Longhorn wave, Yukon wave, or the .Net wave and really have enough
time to have some cross-cutting discussions about how we make that happen.Bill [Gates] is dedicated full-time to being chief software
architect. He also happens to be chairman of the company, but he spends
most of his time being chief software architect. We have a body now that
meets every month -- the SLTT [Senior Leadership Technical Team],

to give them a framework where they can work in harmony with the other

the technical road map and the SLTT process; it is the scenarios. From
my perspective, it is the P&L [profit and loss] structure and the
multiple businesses because, given how we work, giving people a
framework that gets them to make the whole bigger than the sum of the
parts will mean we have better offerings.> It seems the scenarios construct is really working for you. Is this an
> evolution of the solutions approach? I would say it is a pretty direct extrapolation from the solutions
stuff, only I think we are just getting a little more experience. I
think we use the word scenarios more often and solutions less, because
solution sounds more like a fixed thing. At the end of the day, most of
the things we do are customizable and programmable, and so people make
them into the solution they want. But they are still scenarios. What
will software deployment look like? Well, that is a scenario because it
involves Windows, Office, and other applications.We are working hard to make sure the whole is bigger than the sum of the
parts. That's not to say people are always comfortable with this. I
can't even say we will do it perfectly. All we have to do is do it a lot
better than we had been doing it. I think that would be a big step
forward for the customers.> Will this approach cut down on some of the technology civil wars
> Microsoft has had in the past involving who is going to gain control of
> a project? This seems to be a very democratic approach to development.I would not use the word democracy to describe it. People have to come
together and ultimately make some decisions. This is not a voting
process here, the agenda of what we think is important. We get a lot of
input. [But] once it is decided, people don't get to vote with their feet.We try to make a quantum leap here in terms of our ability to improve
pulling together all the pieces. Our customers want us to do
that. Simplifying concepts by unifying them. The customers don't say
they want us to do that, but when we do do that, they go, 'Ahhh, I get
it. That makes sense.'I don't want to go to six more meetings where people say, 'Is your
workflow strategy BizTalk?' ... Or 'What's your Office workflow
strategy?' Or 'Why is synchronization in some ways better for e-mail and
Outlook than it is for file folders and Web pages?'To get that sort of synchronization sometimes -- to get that high-level
road map to work -- you have to build something we don't have today. So
we have been talking about unifying storage. And so the best way to get
all this stuff to work is to get them all to work just one way. Then you
just keep tuning one set of parameters instead of having a thousand
flowers blooming.> In your Fusion keynote today, you talked about who your competitors
> are, and it was the usual suspects. But one you didn't mention is
> yourself. You are competing against the last generation of your technology.Always. Given that our stuff doesn't wear out or break down -- you can
question whether it breaks or not [Ballmer grins] -- but it doesn't
break down like machinery does. To get anyone to do something new, we
have to have something interesting and innovative.People think, OK, should we just do more upgrades or try to sell more
new product? We decided that users like us to do a level of systems
integration so they don't have to get involved in that. So take
Sharepoint Team Services, which we put in Office. We could have sold
Team Services as a separate product, and we could have introduced a new
SKU [stock keeping unit]. We could have decided if it should work down
level with the old Office or just the new version of Office, and we
could do that with real-time communications. But we tend to like to put
things together, integrate them, and then release batches?1202?-- which
are then 'upgrades' -- as a form of introducing our new innovation. But
no matter how you do it, because our stuff does not wear out, we have to
convince people that some idea we have is better or more powerful than
the older idea we had.And there are two aspects of doing that. One aspect is, on a given
product or upgrade release, does that make sense? Or do we convince you
that over an nyear period of time we will have enough innovation that
you will want to be licensed for that innovation. And this is part of
this whole licensing discussion we are having.We moved to the new licensing for two reasons, I would say. No. 1, we
wanted to simplify our licensing. When we look back a year from now, I
guarantee you that where we are now is simpler than where we
were. Nothing is simpler during a transition because they are learning
the new and are more familiar with the old, but I think people will
eventually realize this is simpler. Our licensing got pretty complicated
over the years, and some people came to not understand it all.The other issue is [the timing of delivering] our innovation. I don't
want to have a lot of rough questions [from customers]. So when we do
have new ideas, it's like, OK, should we put it in this upgrade or that
one or just have a stream of stuff that only our best customers have
access to under the terms of their contract? I think in the long run we
have a better chance of satisfying them with the latter than with
hitting them with six different upgrades. I am a fan of [letting] the
customer decide, OK, I want that piece or this piece. But they are
licensed for all of it. So those are the two things we sought to do.> That gets back to the trust issue, where if you front-load it, that's
> the big, lumpy upgrade; and if you back-load it with the vision, the
> .Net 2003 servers, you have a long gap in the middle where you have to
> sell into an untrusting audience.The truth is, we need to be better at both. There are some things you
can only do big and lumpy, like a new file system. It's not like some
sort of small user feature; if you change the file system, then the
storage, the backup, probaby those things are going to change. Probably
the shell ought to change.The applications ... a lot of things are going
to change. Can you call that lumpy? Or you can put out four new features
in PowerPoint, sure -- that would not look lumpy to users.I think we have to build trust in the model, and we are going to have to
deliver more over time. It will not come overnight. People will have to
see that we do a few things, ... that not all of our innovation is
lumpy, that more of it comes evenly and steadily. People develop a
confidence and faith; they like both aspects of the model. Over time,
our support needs to become more intimately involved in that story.We know that, but we don't know exactly what that means yet. And this
whole notion of software as a service -- this is not a licensing or
business discussion. It's how does software get rearchitected in the
world of the Internet? I mean, how many software products are
fundamentally different because of the Internet? Not many. Probably the
anti-virus guys keep up the best. They are always feeding new virus
support in. I asked the audience [at Fusion] how many use Windows
Update. Now that's a small piece of software, but it is big. That's the
consumer market; we've got to get that to really purr in the corporate market.> The lack of broadband build-out and adoption seems to be holding up

> triggered the Baby Bells to get on board with DSL. What are you doing
> now to deal with that issue?The No. 1 thing is, we have to make software that is so compelling that
people will start saying, 'Well, of course I am going to get broadband.'> And 802.11 is one of those compelling features?Yes, it is. I was in a hotel in Sun Valley, [Utah], this week that was
not wired. So I turned on my PC, and XP tells me there is a wireless
network available. So I connect to something called Mountaineer. Well, I
don't know what that is. But I have a VPN into Microsoft; it worked. I
don't know whose broadband I used. I didn't see it in Bill's room. I
called him up and said, 'Hey, come over to my room.' So soon everyone is
there and connecting to the Internet through my room.We have to support all the modalities, whether it is GPRS [General
Packet Radio Service] or 802.11. We have to make it easy to provision
from a software perspective for things that go on with DSL [and] cable
modems. ... And the software has to want a broadband link. There are not
many things you do where you say I really care about the performance. If
I am downloading PowerPoint files, then I want broadband. So when you
can do things with speed that you otherwise can't do without speed, that
is going to put a lot of pressure on the broadband community.That's the weird answer. The more normal answer is, yeah, isn't it
awful: There is not enough broadband, and the prices they charge ... . I
agree with all that. If you look at what happened in Japan recently,
there was a big drop -- it is now $25 a month for DSL. Vroom. They have
gone from almost no DSL connections a year ago to 1.5 [million] or 1.8
million [subscribers].> So how do we make that happen in this country?I think that is beyond us. If there is enough interest where the
consumers are looking intensely for broadband, whether it is at today's
prices or tomorrow's prices, that is going to shake out the
marketplace. And I think the marketplace will do a good job. We just
have to make it something obvious that consumers want. Now I happen to
live in a neigborhood where there is no broadband network. No DSL or
cable modems. Well, I have a neighbor, [Teledesic chairman and co-CEO]
Craig McCaw, who has a wireless network that I think I can piggyback off
of [Ballmer laughs]. So, yes, broadband is a bottleneck -- but I also
think we have to look at oursleves as a software industry and say,
'Aren't we, too, some of that bottleneck?' We have not built software
that makes broadband a must-have.> Microsoft CEO weighs in

----
aDaM@XeNT.CoM -- long .sig alert!I believe it is quite possible to productively apply both supposedly
incompatible approaches [REST & SOAP] together.  I'll sketch it out
below, both in prescriptive form.  Note: while this is proscriptive, it
is expected that local adaptations will be provided.1. Start by modeling the persistent resources that you wish to expose.
By persistent resources, I am referring to entities that have a typical
life expectancy of days or greater.  Ensure that each instance has a
unique URL.  When possible, assign meaningful names to resources.2. Whenever possible, provide a default XML representation for each
representation.  Unlike traditional object oriented programming
languages where there is a unique getter per property, typically there
will be a single representation of the entire instance.  These
representations will often contain XLinks (a.k.a. pointers or
references) to other instances.3. Now add high level methods which take care of all composite create,
update, and delete operations.  A key aspect of the design is that
messages for these operations need to be self contained - both the
sender and receiver should be able to make the absolute minimum of
assumptions as to the other's state, and multiple requests should not be
required to implement a single logical operation.  All requests should
provide the appearance of being executed atomically.4. Query operations deserve special consideration.  A general purpose
XML syntax should be provided in every case.  In addition, when a
reasonable expectation exists that query parameters will be of a
relatively short size and not require significant encoding, then a HTTP
GET with the parameters encoded as a query string should also be
provided.Implications  The following table emphasizes how this unified approach differs from
the ""pure"" (albeit hypothetical) different positions described above.1. Resource -- POST operations explicitly have the possibility of
modifying multiple resources.  PUT and DELETE operations are rarely
used, if ever.  GETs may contain query arguments.2. Get -- GETs must never be used for operations which observably change
the state of the recipient.  POST should be used instead.3. Message -- Do not presume that URLs are static, instead presume that
they identify the resource.  In particular, recognize that URLs can be
dynamically generated.  Expect URLs of other SOAP Resources in
responses.  Use the SOAP Response MEP for pure retrieval operations.4. Procedure -- Treat the URL itself as the implicit first parameter.
Allow URLs to be dynamically generated, and returned in structures.  Use
HTTP GET for retrieval operations.Conclusions  Looking to the future, the application level inter-networking protocols
that emerge today will likely be the application level intra-networking
protocols of the next decade.  Both REST and SOAP contain features that
the others lack.  Most significantly:REST - SOAP = XLinkThe key bit of functionality that SOAP applications miss today is the
ability to link together resources.  SOAP 1.2 makes significant progress
in addressing this.  Hopefully WSDL 1.2 will complete this important work.SOAP - REST = Stored ProceduresLooking at how other large scale systems cope with updates provides some
key insights into productive areas for future research with respect to REST.Finally, it bears repeating.  Just because a service is using HTTP GET,
doesn't mean that it is REST.  If you are encoding parameters on the
URL, you are probably making an RPC request of a service, not retrieving
the representation of a resource.  It is worth reading Roy Fielding's
 thoughts
on the subject.  The only exception to this rule that is routinely
condoned within the REST crowd is queries.  -- Sam Ruby, http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/07/20/restSoap.html

"" dynegy inc . ' s proposed $ 8 . 85 - billion ( u . s . ) takeover of enron corp . faces major uncertainties , ranging from possible opposition from regulators to potentially huge new liabilities and writeoffs at enron . the problem with regulators could come from antitrust worries about folding houston - based enron , the biggest u . s . trader of natural gas and electricity , into dynegy , another major energy trader , also based in houston . enron currently handles a quarter of all the natural gas and electricity traded in the united states . the combined company - - which would be called dynegy inc . - - would have 22 , 000 megawatts of generating capacity and 40 , 000 kilometres of natural gas pipelines , making it one of the largest companies in the united states in each of those categories . while enron and dynegy officials said they expect the merger to garner the necessary government approvals , the review by regulators is expected to take months . as for unpleasant financial surprises , enron has already produced a devastating stream of them over the past month , ranging from huge writeoffs of assets and reductions of shareholder equity to major downward restatements of past earnings reports . much of this turmoil has been caused by enron ' s dealings with private partnerships run by its own officers . indeed , recent enron disclosures indicate that as much as half of the company ' s pretax earnings in recent years came from deals with these officer - related partnerships , raising further questions about the quality of enron ' s earnings and the potential for hundreds of millions of dollars of additional writeoffs or restatements . enron ' s partnership dealings have sparked more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits and a formal investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission . in a measure of the continuing concerns over enron ' s financial condition , both moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s once again downgraded enron ' s debt on friday , this time to just one level above non - investment grade , or "" junk "" status . they also kept the company under review for possible additional downgrades , and s & p put dynegy on the same status . a downgrade to junk status could force enron to come up with hundreds of millions of dollars in cash or stock to buttress some of its complicated financial transactions . in an interview friday , dynegy chairman chuck watson said his company made "" a good assessment "" of enron ' s condition and that in "" the worst - case we can come up with . . . we feel comfortable [ that ] the value exceeds the liabilities . "" mr . watson said dynegy has given itself the opportunity to back out of the proposed merger under certain conditions , which he declined to specify . a person familiar with the deal said that dynegy has a right to walk away if enron ' s additional legal and financial liabilities exceed $ 3 . 5 - billion . a dynegy spokesman confirmed the figure . the price being paid - - 0 . 2685 of a dynegy share for each enron share - - is a fire - sale deal by any recent historical standard . the transaction valued enron shares at $ 10 . 41 each , based on dynegy ' s price of $ 38 . 76 friday , up $ 2 . 26 in new york stock exchange trading . enron shares rose 22 cents at $ 8 . 63 in big board trading , a quarter of their price just a month ago and less than a tenth of the all - time high of nearly $ 90 a share reached last year . the deal envisions quickly pumping $ 1 . 5 - billion of cash into enron to bolster its liquidity and comfort enron ' s trading partners who are increasingly nervous about continuing their business . the funds will come from chevrontexaco corp . , dynegy ' s biggest shareholder with a 26 - per - cent stake . dynegy will use the money to purchase the preferred stock and other rights in an enron pipeline subsidiary . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . companies it must also renegotiate contracts guaranteeing performance and warranties that have fallen into abeyance with the closure of the plant .

"" if that ' s your modus operandi , when things don ' t go well people come after you , "" mr watson says . he believes that image of cockiness made questions over enron ' s balance sheet spiral out of control . the balance sheet adjustment itself could not justify the massive degradation of its equity in a matter of weeks . "" the masses at enron are thirsting for a change in image , "" mr watson says . he intends to give them that . mr watson will remain in charge when dynegy takes control of enron in the coming months . he has asked mr lay to join the board , but mr lay has not made a decision . "" it ' s been a good ride , for the most part , "" mr lay said friday night , but added , "" i would say the last three weeks have not been a lot of fun . "" mr watson reached out to mr lay on october 24 , as the crisis of confidence in enron became increasingly untenable . the securities and exchange commission was investigating its finances , investors were dumping its stock and the credit rating agencies were downgrading its debt . mr watson ' s mother was having heart surgery and he was with her in saint louis . but he called mr lay to offer to help . in the back of his mind was the possibility of buying enron ' s valuable pipeline assets to provide it with liquidity to support its fast diminishing business . two days later , mr watson went over to mr lay ' s home to begin working towards a combination . in a meeting with mr lay and the rest of enron ' s management team , it became clear they were "" willing to fix the problem whatever it took "" . mr watson believes the deal was put together so quickly because dynegy works with enron on a daily basis , they know each other ' s people and businesses , and they are both based in houston . "" we ' re one of the few people , maybe the only ones , who could have pulled it off , "" he says . now that he has done so , mr watson plans to move into enron ' s new buildings , but has not decided whether to rename the stadium to reflect its new owner . his teenager wants him too . but that would seem to go against the modesty that enabled dynegy to win in the end .

( c ) copyright financial times group . http : / / www . ft . com . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c market place dynegy ' s rushed gamble on enron carries some big risks by alex berenson and richard a . oppel jr . 11 / 12 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company call it a $ 9 billion shotgun wedding . dynegy inc . , an energy marketer and trader based in houston , took the biggest gamble in its corporate history on friday by agreeing to buy the enron corporation , its much larger crosstown rival , for more than $ 9 billion in stock . in one decisive move , chuck watson , the chairman of dynegy , positioned his company to become the most important player in the volatile but potentially lucrative business of trading natural gas and electricity . but the hastily arranged deal carries big risks for dynegy as well , skeptical investors and wall street analysts say . no one outside enron appears to understand the company ' s tangled finances fully , and the speed with which the deal was made did not give dynegy time to scrutinize in great detail enron ' s trading book or the web of partnerships enron has entered to move debt off its balance sheet and hide losses . the skeptics wonder why dynegy decided to take on enron ' s huge debt , which some analysts say could total $ 23 billion in loans on and off its balance sheet , instead of simply trying to hire away enron ' s best traders , some of whom were already leaving the company . ' ' there are many risks associated with this merger that we will not know about for a while , ' ' said carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities . ' ' we ' re not sure that we know everything there is to know at enron yet . ' ' in addition , enron ' s earnings could be far lower than it has reported , said james chanos , a short - seller who has been a vocal critic . on thursday , enron said in a filing with the securities and exchange commission that it had used partnerships to overstate its earnings by a total of $ 600 million over the last five years . mr . chanos said other information in the filing indicated that more restatements were possible . with so much uncertainty surrounding enron ' s finances , mr . chanos and other analysts question dynegy ' s decision to move so quickly . they note that dynegy and enron often traded with each other , and some analysts had wondered whether , if enron had filed for bankruptcy , those trades might be wiped out , leaving dynegy unhedged , or unprotected against sudden movements in the prices of natural gas or electricity . if , on the other hand , enron is not forced to restate its profits down further , then dynegy has clinched an amazing bargain . analysts say enron will make $ 1 . 80 a share this year , so dynegy is paying just six times enron ' s annual earnings , about a fourth the average ratio of companies in the standard & poor ' s 500 . dynegy said on friday that the deal should increase its per - share earnings next year by 90 to 95 cents , to $ 3 . 40 to $ 3 . 50 , even without factoring in up to a half - billion dollars in annual savings , before taxes , from the merger . dynegy ' s shares closed friday at $ 38 . 76 , up $ 2 . 26 , so if the company ' s forecast is accurate , it is trading at 11 times its 2002 earnings - - still a bargain compared with the average stock in the s . & . p 500 . jeff dietert , an analyst with simmons & company in houston , said dynegy ' s estimates for its earnings in 2002 were ' ' conservative and very achievable . ' ' mr . watson said friday that dynegy was confident that enron ' s operations and its trading business were healthy . ' ' we feel this is a very solid company with plenty of capacity to withstand whatever happens the next few months , ' ' he said . mr . dietert said dynegy needed to strike a deal with enron quickly to make sure that enron ' s trading operations and financial health did not deteriorate any further . ' ' if enron preserves the value of the marketing and trading company , then there is clearly value in the enron stock , ' ' he said . preserving enron ' s investment - grade credit rating is crucial to keeping the trading operation afloat . to help convince moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s , the major rating agencies , that enron ' s rating should remain investment - grade , dynegy has agreed to inject $ 1 . 5 billion into enron immediately . still , on friday , both agencies cut enron ' s rating to just one notch above noninvestment grade , or junk , status , and both suggested that the rating could fall further . so investors and creditors will watch carefully this week to see whether other energy companies continue trading with enron , and whether the merger stems the outflow of talented enron traders . another question hanging over the deal is how easy it will be for dynegy to walk away if enron ' s finances turn out to be worse that enron has already disclosed . the merger agreement , according to executives and investment bankers who shaped it , gives dynegy the opportunity to quit the deal without penalty if major new problems surface . but what exactly those terms are remains unknown . so far , investors are giving dynegy the benefit of the doubt . the company ' s stock rose 17 percent on thursday and friday .

' ' andersen partner david tabolt has said the firm is cooperating with a special committee of enron ' s board of directors appointed to investigate the accounting problems . ` ` issues have surfaced that have caused the company to restate its financial statements and advise investors that they should not rely on its financial statements or our audit reports , ' ' tabolt said , adding , ` ` we certainly recognize the appropriateness of that decision . ' ' settled suits the sec and shareholders can sue an accounting company for issuing false and misleading financial reports about a publicly traded company . andersen this year paid $ 130 million to settle lawsuits alleging the firm allowed waste management inc . and sunbeam corp . to file false financial reports that cost investors billions of dollars in losses . lynn turner , who was the sec ' s chief accountant for three years until he resigned in august , said enron and andersen ignored a basic accounting rule when they overstated shareholder ' s equity . explaining the equity reduction last week , enron said it had given common stock to companies created by enron ' s former chief financial officer in exchange for notes receivable , and then improperly increased shareholder equity on its balance sheet by the value of the notes . ' basic accounting ' ` ` what we teach in college is that you don ' t record equity until you get cash for it , and a note is not cash , ' ' said turner , who is now director of the center for quality financial reporting at colorado state university . ` ` it ' s a mystery how both the company would violate , and the auditors would miss , such a basic accounting rule , when the number is one billion dollars . ' ' enron paid andersen $ 52 million last year , $ 25 million for auditing and $ 27 million for services including business and tax consulting , due diligence procedures and help in preparing sec filings , according the company ' s proxy statement . enron and andersen declined to provide further detail . those fees were proportionately larger than some other companies paid outside auditors . exxon mobil , the world ' s largest oil company , with more than twice enron ' s $ 100 . 1 billion of revenue , paid 29 percent less to its auditor , llp . dynegy , which is also audited by andersen , paid $ 3 . 2 million for its audit and $ 4 . 1 million in other fees . that is 86 percent less than enron paid . dynegy ' s revenue of $ 29 . 5 billion was 71 percent less than enron ' s . consulting work john coffee , adolf a . berle professor of law at columbia university law school , said he is concerned about the $ 27 million enron paid andersen for non - audit work . ` ` if you had an auditor that wasn ' t trying to cross - sell other services with more profit potential , would it have been as acquiescent ? ' ' coffee asked . andersen ' s tabolt defended the firm ' s consulting work for enron . ` ` we help improve the quality of financial reporting by helping clients understand the accounting rules and how to apply them , ' ' said tabolt . ` ` in doing this , we follow the rules of the profession and the sec . ' ' in the waste management and sunbeam cases , shareholders and the sec alleged that andersen allowed the companies to inflate earnings and revenue . the firm agreed last week to pay $ 20 million to settle a malpractice lawsuit over its audit work for waste management . last june , andersen agreed to pay a $ 7 million civil fine , the largest ever imposed by the sec against a big - five accounting firm . ' black eyes ' in april , andersen agreed to pay $ 110 million to settle a securities fraud class action suit filed over its accounting work for appliance maker sunbeam corp . the appliance maker filed for bankruptcy protection in february . ` ` andersen now has three black eyes in a row , ' ' said coffee , who addressed the national institute on class actions of the american bar association on friday in san francisco . the group ' s members are lawyers who have collected billions of dollars for investors in securities fraud class action suits against public companies . ` ` there ' s a beauty contest going on , ' ' said coffee , referring to meetings taking place at the conference . he said law firms are courting some of enron ' s institutional investors for the right to represent them against the energy company and its auditor . andersen ' s tabolt said the sec hasn ' t notified the firm that it is under investigation in connection with its work for enron . coffee expressed concern that sec chairman harvey pitt , who took over the agency in august , may not be as aggressive in pursuing accounting fraud as his predecessor , arthur levitt . as a private lawyer , pitt represented major accounting firms . ` ` anyone who violates the law , and i do mean anyone , will be held to the same high standards the agency has applied for nearly seven decades , ' ' said pitt in an interview . ` ` there are no special rules for any class of violator . ' ' he declined to comment on enron and andersen because of the agency ' s investigation . dynegy calls sec ' s probe of enron ` financial noise ' ( updatel ) 2001 - 11 - 12 06 : 59 ( new york ) dynegy calls sec ' s probe of enron ` financial noise ' ( updatel ) ( adds enron share trading in germany in 14 th paragraph . ) houston , nov . 12 ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . chairman chuck watson said he ' s convinced enron corp . ' s trading operations are sound and described disclosures about affiliated partnerships that helped drive enron ' s stock down 67 percent in three weeks as ` ` financial noise . ' ' dynegy agreed friday to buy enron for at least $ 23 billion , including at least $ 8 billion in stock and $ 15 billion in assumed debt . in an interview after the merger announcement , watson and enron chairman kenneth lay discussed how the houston - based companies reached agreement less than three weeks after enron ' s shares began plunging . ` ` all the financial noise about the partnerships , maybe it has damaged the enron brand a bit , ' ' watson said . ` ` but i ' ll tell you what it hasn ' t impacted , and that ' s the high regard that the industry places on ' ' enron ' s trading business , he said . enron last week restated earnings for four years to include losses from three affiliated partnerships , reducing earnings by $ 586 million . six employees , out of enron ' s 20 , 000 , may have improperly benefited from the partnerships , lay said . ` ` i ' m sorry those six people seem to have gone somewhat over the edge in their dealings or transactions , but you can ' t be absolutely protected from that in any business , ' ' he said . lost effectiveness lay didn ' t specify which six people he was referring to . he removed andrew fastow , who helped set up and ran many of the affiliated partnerships , as chief financial officer on oct . 24 . an enron securities filing says fastow made more than $ 30 million off two of the partnerships . fastow ` ` had lost his effectiveness because of all the press coverage ' ' on the affiliates , lay said . treasurer ben glisan and kristina mordaunt , a managing director and a corporate counsel for an enron division , also were fired , enron said in a corporate filing on thursday . former employees michael kopper , kathy lynn and anne yeager were in a position to profit from partnerships , the filing said . ` ` you trust people , you accept their representations and proposals , ' ' lay said . ` ` sometimes when you do that , you get surprised and disappointed . ' ' both executives said they expect antitrust regulators to approve the merger because the two companies own different types of assets and won ' t dominate any market . ` ` there really isn ' t anything that lays on top of each other , ' ' watson said friday night . ` ` we ' re not in the pipeline business and they are . we ' re in the generation business , and they ' re really not . ' ' dynegy shares rose 6 . 2 percent on friday after terms of the enron purchase leaked to the press . watson expects the acquisition to add 90 cents to 95 cents a share , or 35 percent , to dynegy ' s 2002 earnings . enron is selling for $ 10 . 41 a share , one - fifth the average price over the past 12 months . enron stock climbed 96 cents to $ 9 . 59 in germany as 54 , 497 shares traded . cash crunch the rapid decline of enron threatened to bankrupt the company and disrupt energy markets . enron handles an estimated one - quarter of u . s . electricity and natural - gas trades . a falling credit rating made it difficult for the company to raise capital needed to back trades . as part of the purchase , chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26 percent of dynegy , agreed to provide enron with $ 2 . 5 billion . ` ` what we found when looked under the hood is that the core of enron was still there and working as well as ever , ' ' watson said . ` ` that business was pristine and had nothing to do with the partnerships . ' ' dynegy began taking steps toward the acquisition in late october , when watson called lay to offer assistance with enron ' s growing financial crisis , the two men said . that led to a saturday morning meeting in lay ' s kitchen . ` ` he even made me a breakfast roll , ' ' watson said . ` ` he didn ' t eat it , ' ' lay said . lay said he won ' t be an active manager in the new company . watson said friday that he and lay hadn ' t discussed a severance package . as head of enron , lay had refocused the houston operator of u . s . natural - gas pipelines on trading and international expansion , boosting reported revenue 20 - fold since 1995 to $ 100 . 8 billion last year . he said he doesn ' t regret the strategy . ` ` clearly , enron has gotten involved in business that hasn ' t turned out well , ' ' lay said , pointing to money - losers azurix inc . , created to supply water and build related projects around the world , and newpower holdings inc . , a seller of electricity to homes and small businesses . ` ` but you have to keep in mind , too , that 12 years ago we weren ' t in the wholesale merchant ( trading ) business . today that ' s an incredibly valuable franchise . ' ' the trading business , which accounts for about 97 percent of enron ' s revenue , buys electricity , gas and other commodities from producers and sells them to end users such as utilities and industrial customers . it also advises big business customers on energy use and sells them gas and electricity . reassessing steel , lumber watson said the new company will keep trading coal , gas , power and petroleum products , and plans to expand by buying assets and using them to develop trading . ` ` we ' ll just have to reassess over time whether we stay in ' ' trading of steel , lumber and other non - energy commodities , he said . enron wants to shed its 65 percent stake in dabhol power co . in india , which is owed $ 64 million in overdue bills from a state government agency that has refused to pay the power prices enron was promised in contracts . ` ` we have strong legal remedies and we ' re heading down the path toward arbitration , but we ' d still very much like to work out a settlement with the government , ' ' lay said . potential buyers have balked at enron ' s $ 1 billion asking price for dabhol . neither man would comment on whether dynegy plans to cut jobs after the merger , or what will happen to the naming rights to enron field . the major league baseball stadium is home to the houston astros , and enron paid $ 100 million to have its name on the ballpark . ` ` the name of the company is now dynegy , ' ' watson said . dynegy ' s acquisition requires approval from u . s . securities , antitrust and energy regulators . watson expects soon to share details of the new dynegy with regulators from the european union and u . k . , where enron operates a trading desk and owns a water company and two power plants . ` ` i don ' t know if we are required to do so , but we will talk to them anyway , ' ' watson said . ` ` we don ' t think there are going to be any problems , ' ' lay said . citigroup , j . p . morgan mull $ 500 mln enron stake , dow says 2001 - 11 - 12 03 : 06 ( new york ) london , nov . 12 ( bloomberg ) - - j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . may invest $ 250 million each in enron corp . , the company they are advising in its agreed takeover by dynegy inc . , to stop credit downgrades , dow jones newswires reported , citing people familiar with the matter . dynegy agreed friday to buy the largest energy trader for at least $ 23 billion , including at least $ 8 billion in stock and $ 15 billion in assumed debt . moody ' s investors service maintained an investment grade rating on enron after the two banks told the credit agency they were mulling a $ 500 million investment , bolstering the company ' s financial outlook , the paper said . moody ' s decision removed the threat that a junk rating would create a cash crunch by forcing enron to repay early $ 3 . 3 billion of bonds . last month , j . p . morgan and citigroup gave enron a $ 1 billion credit line , using the company ' s pipeline systems as collateral , the paper said . the investment , which raises conflict of interest issues , may take several weeks to complete , the paper said . citibank and j . p . morgan spokesmen declined to comment . moody ' s spokesman also wouldn ' t comment .

systems you just add a flag and memory is tracked (that's how i've always
done it) or worst case yuo have to run it through one of the 2.3E7 tools
where you simply recompile and it it tells you where the leaks are.Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the
hardware functions. Granted, this takes 30 minutes to go over, and so is far
beyond the scope of the ""Learn Java in 90 minutes without thinking"" book

Date: Not suppliedBlake blogs[1] about how mpt[2] wants Mozilla to look just like MSIE. I have to 
admit, the evidence is pretty compelling. I recall someone asking me, ""Do you 
really agree with mpt's Top 10 list? He's quoted you at the top of the list!""Do I agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems? Of 
course not. No two people will have the same top ten problems. Also keep in 
mind that mpt and I can agree that something is a problem without necessarily 
agreeing on the solution to the problem. Maybe we have different ideas 
regarding how to solve a particular issue, but we at least both believe it is 
an issue that needs to be addressed. That's something.To cover the list specifically:
- Navigator chrome structure - While I don't necessarily agree with mpt's 
proposed default configuration, I do agree that the chrome structure is 
painfully restrictive, and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in 
order for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem.- Speed - can't argue with this, except to say that cutting out a lot of the 
useless UI and features from the chrome helps substantially. Reduce bloat, gain 
speed.- Text editing - if you use Chimera on the Mac, you'll see that the textfield 
widget is easily the most painful part of the entire application. It's buggy, 
slow, misbehaves, and doesn't edit the way you'd expect. This is IMO Chimera's 
top usability problem.- Message display - Yes. No argument here.- Search - Yeah, it's a mess. Don't know if it would be in my top ten, but it's 
a mess.- Menu structure - This gets back to my blog about how the apps should be 
separated. The menu structure has been complicated in order to deal with 
multiple applications. A clean separation naturally simplifies the menus (e.g., 
you can eliminate the New submenu easily).- Migration - A problem, but IMO not one of the top ten facing Mozilla.- Context menus - mpt complains about two-click context menus, and yet, the OS 
default on Win32 (overwhelmingly) is to bring up a context menu on a mouse up. 
If you don't like it, complain about Win32, but don't cite this as a Mozilla 
usability problem when we're following the conventions of the operating system. 
(We simply listen for the WM_CONTEXTMENU message. That message fires when Win32 
wants to fire it.)- Validation - Err, no. Not a usability problem. To the average bear, this is 
completely irrelevant.- Preferences - IMO this should be much higher on the list. Preferences are a 
tangled pathetic mess. Again, separating prefs for individual apps into unique 
dialogs would simplify things a great deal, but we should also remove nearly 
half the preferences that exist from the GUI. Mozilla is ridiculously 
overconfigurable.[1] http://www.blakeross.com/archives/2002_08_18_index.html#80418641

In the twenty-first century, only > nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and > guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the > potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People > everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them; > worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own > property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom > are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of > protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of > freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages. > > Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military > strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our > heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for > unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that > favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies > can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and > economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the > world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace > against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace > by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the > peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent. > > Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental > commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed > dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great > industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of > individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less > than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to > penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies > against us. > > To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- > from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and > cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global > reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help > nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will > hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the > allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and > countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop > new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every > turn. > > The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism > and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking > weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing > so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to > succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other > means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, > contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous > technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America > will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We > cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must > be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence > and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who > saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have > entered, the only path to safety is the path of action. > > As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic > opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community > has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the > seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace > instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers > find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist > violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common > interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by > common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching > for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror.

We will strongly resist aggression from other great > powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, > trade, and cultural advancement. > > Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend > the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring > the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to > every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us > that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our > national interests as strong states.

Yet poverty, weak institutions, and > corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and > drug cartels within their borders. > > The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a > better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free > trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies > out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual > nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to > build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. > The United States will deliver greater development assistance through > the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly, > invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom.

Farber's PicksDanFarberMicrosoft stresses security for ExchangeMicrosoft is readying a new Exchange Server e-mail system, with improved security, a facelift for Outlook, and better support for cell phones and other handhelds. The upcoming version, the company's first major update of the product since releasing Exchange 2000 nearly two years ago, will by default disable certain messaging features to prevent hackers and virus makers from taking advantage of openings. While Microsoft's biggest nemesis in the e-mail and messaging market is Lotus, the company also competes against Novell and newcomer Oracle, which plans to release its own e-mail and messaging software later this year. 
Read the full storyIBM puts more bite in 'Shark'Can IBM's release of a new top-end ""Shark"" enterprise storage system boost the company's prospects in the depressed storage market? Big Blue has fixed many early Shark problems, improving everything from data transfer capabilities to cache size, and adding RAID 10 support and Eliza self-healing features. But IBM faces the still dominant EMC, which last week lured away Mark Lewis from HP to become its new CTO; and Hitachi, which  still boasts the technology edge. IBM's edge is its ability to bundle Shark sales with related server and service deals.

"I rigged this up for testing before I commit to a sitewide rollout of
Spamassassin as an SMTP relay.
It is more work, but it avoids sitewide changes in mail delivery during the
early stages of testing.On the Exchange server... (mail.yourdomain.com)
Create a new, private SMTP address (nomorespam@yourdomain.com) for the
mailbox you want to protect. Remove the old address.Create a ""custom recipient"" with the old SMTP address
(spammedalot@yourdomain.com). Create another custom recipient pointing at a
local user on the Spamassassin box (killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.com).Set the first custom recipient to forward all mail to the second custom
recipient. (must forward to another address in the Exchange directory)On the Spamassassin box... (filtermail.yourdomain.com)
Set up a dummy user, in this case ""killspam""
Give killspam a .forward file pointing to the final recipient's new, private
smtp address back on the Exchange server.So the message flow is like this:Mail arrives on the Exchange server mail.yourdomain.com for
spammedalot@yourdomain.comspammedalot@commonwealth.com forwards it to
killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.comFollowing the .forward file, the e-mail is then forwarded to
nomorespam@yourdomain.com
Wowie Zowie it works. The first address I protected was myself, the second
one I protected was postmaster.As you can see, you must create two custom recipients in Exchange and one
dummy account with a .forward file on the spam filter box for each address
you want to protect. Like I said, it is more work, but until I am done
load-testing, this is the way it will stay.-jake

"tanlps workshop : final call for paper tanlps workshop : final call for papers held at the european conference on machine learning ( ecml ' 98 ) , chemnitz , germany 21-24 april 1998 ( www address : http : / / www . tu-chemnitz . de / informatik / ecml98 / ) . tanlps towards adaptive nlp - driven systems : linguistic information , learning methods and applications 24 april 1998 organized by : r . basili , m . t . pazienza ( university of roma , tor vergata , italy ) since most of its applications , from syntactic to semantic , are lexicon driven , systematic and reliable acquisition on a large scale of linguistic information is the real challenge to natural language processing ( nlp ) . empiricist view on natural language processing and learning has become recently more attractive for a wider research community : computational linguistics , artificial intelligence , psychology then seemed to converge on a specific data-oriented perspective aiming to overcome the traditional knowledge acquisition bottleneck . it has been often noted that the limited attention paid by the machine learning community to text and speech data seems unjustified . it is thus more and more evident that empirical learning of natural language processing ( nlp ) can alleviate the nlp main problem by means of a variety of methods for the automatic induction of lexical knowledge . lexical knowledge is often hard to compile by hand , and even harder to port and reuse . nlp application systems still have a low impact on real world problems , mainly due to the costs related to reusability and customization of the required lexicons . in particular , changes in the domain causes changes in the lexical information required in the underlying natural language . empirical , symbolic machine learning methods can be perfectly suited for this task like automatic acquisition and adaptation of this knowledge . rule induction , symbolic approaches to clustering , lazy learning , and inductive logic programming , have been already proposed by a growing community that is entering the challenge for theoretical ( i . e . methodological ) and application purposes a variety of techniques seems to be combined in order to successfully design realistic inductive systems for text processing : the target of this research is to define methods and design principles for systems combining linguistic and lexical learning capabilities for large scale language processing tasks . this is what we mean with adaptive nlp - driven systems . within this research task , some issues can favour a synergistic process between nlp and ml areas : the access to large data sets , that are even increasing over time , due to the telematics facilities available nowadays ; extending the set of typical classes of ml problems to other hard cases ( particularly dense in the nlp processes ) ; adding inductive capabilities to nlp system for tasks related to specific applications ( i . e . information extraction ) . the proposed workshop thus aims at stimulating reasearch and discussion on the following aspects : - establishing results and evidencies on the suitability of different ml paradigms on specific levels of representation of lexical knowledge ( morphology , syntax , linguistic inference among others ) - comparison of the quantitative approaches to lexical acquisition with empirical symbolic methods - stimulating discussion on cognitive perspective of some models within a plausible architecture for language processing and learning - establishing results on the applicability of the extracted / induce knowledge within nlp systems , with respect to assessed evaluation criteria , typical of the ml and language engineering ( le ) area - case studies on adaptive nlp systems , i . e . effective nlp systems integrating linguistic inferences with inductive capabilities ( www kb at cmu , ecran , . . . ) , - critical review of existing experiences on adaptive nlp systems - establishing guidelines for an evaluation framework of adaptive nlp systems : accuracy of the linguistic process , robustness of the induction process , . . . - promote cooperation among research groups in europe and usa to exchange ideas , data and tools for design and experiment architectures for adaptive nlp systems related events a parallel workshop will be also held in the ecml conference : "" text mining "" organized by yves kodratoff . although close in intent and topics , the two workshops have a specific "" identity "" in terms of area of research , multidisciplinary aspects and contributions . so , in order to enhance the discussion and the synergistic contributions to the two independent approaches , submissions covering common problems ( i . e . adaptive data mining from textual data ) will undergo a specific review , in cooperation with the other workshop pc . in fact , a joint ( half day ) session on specific borderline topics as well as on existing ( hybrid ) systems has been planned and a subset of the accepted papers will be presented there . a particular effort will be asked to authors for stressing / enhancing synergistic aspects . the program committee will suggest guidelines to compare / generalize / extend individual contributions in this specific perspective . workshop format : the workshop is expected to cover the whole day . in the first session , apart from an invited talk , we expect to cover methodological issues . papers related to advanced research on suitability of learning paradigms for the different target lexical information will be favoured . prototypical examples in this area are studies on empirical learning of tasks like pos tagging , induction of grammatical information , symbolic learning of word sense disambiguation criteria and lexical semantic information . a panel discussion is expected to close the morning session and focus on principles of suitability for learning paradigms vs . lexical levels . in the second session we expect to stimulate participants to cover application areas , like ir and ie , on original research works that are currently under development in several research centres in europe ( sheffield , tilburg , rome tor vergata and torino universities ) . a panel discussion on the implication of the adaptive paradigm on existing and potential nlp systems will close the workshop . program committee r . basili ( university of roma , tor vergata , italy ) m . craven ( carnegie mellon university , usa ) w . daelemans ( university of tilburg , nederlands ) m . t . pazienza ( university of roma , tor vergata , italy ) l . saitta ( university of torino , italy ) c . samuelssonn ( bell labs , at&t , usa ) y . wilks ( university of sheffield , uk ) paper submission : = = = = = = = = = = = = papers should not exceed 3000 words or 6 pages . hard copy submission : three copies of the paper should be sent to : roberto basili department of computer science , systems and production university of roma , tor vergata via di tor vergata 00133 roma ( italy ) e-mail : basili @ info . utovrm . it electronic submission : electronic submission may be in either self-contained postscript or rtf formats , to basili @ info . utovrm . it for each submission -

Â  07.22.2002 GnomeREPORT Hackers and crackers respect only one thing: strong security.  Keep the bad guys out of your PC or network with the advanced technology that's trusted by millions:  ZoneAlarm Pro 3.0. This best-in-class personal firewall stops hackers cold, defends your online privacy,and sets up in minutes. Click here to download now!   Listen to Lockergnomie Dale Lowery and you'll save time
immediately. It's an old tip, but it bears repeating: ""I'll often
find Web snippets I'd like to keep - but I don't want to save the
entire page. So, I've HOT-KEYED Notepad. Easy! Get to the most
common Notepad shortcut icon: Start | Programs | Accessories |
Notepad. Then right-click on the menu item and select Properties.
You'll see that this is (indeed) a shortcut; in the lower part of
the dialog is a field to add a hotkey. I entered 'N' for Notepad,
Windows offered CTRL and ALT as a prefix, and now I can launch
Notepad in an instant. I highlight the text I want to keep, copy
it, tap my shortcut, paste it, and then save the new text file
wherever I want. Most often, I use this trick to copy paragraphs
that describe downloads (and save them as text files in the same
folder as the download)."" Just make sure you don't pick a keyboard
shortcut that's already in use. Otherwise, one of them is gonna
get cranky.And while we're taking a trip down memory lane, Lockergnomie Ian
Rich reminds us of Jouni Vuorio's utility: The site is
jv16.org. The program is called
jv16 Power Tools, and this freeware is truly worthy of praise. It
combines a full-on registry management tool with several file
manager tools: one to hunt down temporary files in any format and
the other to help perform advanced file searches and comparisons.
Mainly, I wanted the program to be brought to the attention of the
consumer public, as it moves further and further along in
development it just keeps getting better. I've used it on windows
Me, and now XP - without crashes or hair-raising Registry
corruption. It backs up everything it changes and is very easy to
use. If you're interested in something of shareware-quality with
forum support (for absolutely nothing), get this program. Anyway,
I love the newsletter and the work you guys and gals do at
Lockergnome. I hope that this author gets his recognition.""
Consider this a huge nod!I love a good resource, and Lockergnomie Elton Jonsson from the
United Kingdom has one for us, too: ""As a dedicated subscriber, I
just had to tell about this one. Have you ever been driven mad
trying to find out the name of the piece of music on a television
advert? Well, at last, here in the UK, we have an answer to that
problem and, given that many multinationals use the same
advertising in the USA as they do here, it may help out you guys
as well. Check out Commercial
Breaks and Beats. I have no connection with it; I'm just
grateful that someone has had the brilliant idea of creating it.

Lockergnomie David Brown can oblige: ""The e-mail forwarding
service is a good idea, but you can do it yourself with Outlook
Express. Set up two accounts (one for your old account and one for
your new one). Craft your reply in a new message and save it.
Then, select Tools | Message Rules | Mail | New rule. Check 'Where
the message is from specified account' in the first section.
'Reply with message"" in section two. Select the appropriate
account and message in the final section. Name it. You can also
have the messages flagged or moved to another folder if you want
to know which messages came from the old account. Once the rule
has been created, any mail from the old account will have a reply
sent. People should learn about mail rules, anyway."" True! So,
what rule simplifies your day?See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Chris PirilloÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â

Network File Monit 2.04QuicKalendar v1.0.2 [430k] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://www.trinfinitysoftware.com/quickalendar.shtml{Calendar utility} You say you want to get together on the 25th, but what DAY is that? I'm not good with calendar dates; truth be told, I don't even know what day of the week it is most the time. If I didn't have my PDA armed with a Calendar with me, then I wouldn't show up to anything on time, let alone on the right day. Well, that is great for when I am mobile, but what about when I am in front of my PC? The PDA is docked, but that doesn't mean I have to be without a calendar... enter QuicKalendar! ""QuicKalendar gives you quick and easy access to a calendar whenever you need it. You can view the calendar on screen, or print it out to jot down notes and appointments."" You need to keep in mind that the print feature is relative to how you have QuicKalendar displayed on your machine. If you are in full screen mode, then the printout will be bigger than a standard sheet of letter paper. If you try printing in normal view, then the printout will be too small to write on. My suggestion is to play with the size of QuicKalendar's screen until you get a printout that you can be proud of. Now, you'll have no reason to be late for Gnomedex!
Diatris v1.0 [407k] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://www.webruler.com/mtreciokas/{Tetris-like game} I've always been fascinated with geometric shapes. To me everything has to be somewhat symmetrical... even my hair! So it was no wonder why I was addicted to playing the game Tetris for so many years. The only problem with Tetris is that, after awhile, it starts to get a little too easy. Diatris is a bundle of three different - and much more challenging - Tetris-like games. ""For the first game, Y-Diatris, the objects can move vertically and diagonally. The second game, X-Diatris, the objects can move only in two diagonal directions; the vertical drop is taken out. For the last game H-Diatris the objects can only move vertically and horizontally like most block drop games."" I won't kid you, these games can be pretty hard, but if you are a Tetris fan, then these set of games are for you. If you're not a Tetris fan, don't worry, there are a few other games you might like on this site, so check it out!

Modem Spy v3.1.3b [230k] W9x/2k/XP $25
    Unearthed by Sergei Polishchukhttp://www.modemspy.com/{Answering machine} ""Modem spy is a handy utility for phone calls recording. Features: 1) Records phone conversations. 2) Records from microphone. 3) Plays back recorded messages via phone line. 4) Plays back recorded messages via sound card. 5) Can record ALL incoming phone calls. 6) Has built-in software automatic gain control. 7) Detects and logs Caller ID."" Gnomie Brian Stevens tried this one out for us, but had a small problem testing this on any of his machines... he doesn't have any modems! Brian says, ""I was able to load the program, though, and try a few of the features out. You can record an audio memo to your machine, much like an answering machine. You can also e-mail this audio memo, although I don't recommend you do that as the WAV file didn't seem to play well when I tried e-mailing it to myself (which may have been due to the microphone it was recorded with). Other than that, Modem Spy is a solid program and is a great alternative to buying a traditional answering machine... plus in most cases it is cheaper!"" Keep in mind that, for Caller ID to work, you need the Caller ID service turned on by your phone service provider.

TheAvocadoPapers.com is one of those sites that is a little bit goofy but extremely creative. It isn't that the Web site is really about anything; there is some creative writing (usually rather funny) and the occasional interview (this week ""Steve Schneider Interviews Himself"").

Â GnomeTIPThis tip is for the Windows XP users out there. ""The Windows XP operating system achieves excellent performance in part by dynamic adjustments that it makes in response to how a system is utilized. In particular, many adjustments are made when the system first runs following setup and when newly installed applications are used for the first time. These adjustments greatly influence the performance of the system. Unfortunately, the dynamic nature of Windows XP can make benchmarking more of a challenge than with previous Windows versions."" To properly benchmark your Windows XP system, there are a few steps you should follow. The step with which we are concerned in this particular tip is letting your PC process any ""idle tasks."" Idle tasks are tasks that your PC executes when it deems the system to be unused or idle. Some of these include file placement optimization, system restore, and done-once-after-setup work items. ""All of these 'idle tasks' are controllable by a system API in advapi32.dll, ProcessIdleTasks. The API's sole purpose is to allow benchmarks a simple way to force any pending idle tasks to be executed immediately, without having to wait a lengthy period of time. To call ProcessIdleTasks from the command line, use this syntax: Rundll32.exe advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks."" Once running, it may take up to around 15 minutes to process all of the idle tasks, and your hard drive will be active through most of it. For more steps on preparing your Windows XP machine for benchmarking, head over to the Windows Platform Development page on Benchmarking for Windows XP on Microsoft's site.

"article on gas marketers : top gas gorillas note the discussion on market share halfway through the article . top gas gorillas show strong volume growth the year 2000 was a banner year for the top players in gas marketing , with huge increases in gas prices , enormous volatility , continuing growth in sales volumes and major potential for profits . physical gas sales volumes for the top 20 marketers in ngi ' s ranking grew 17 % to nearly 150 bcf / d , and profits among the larger players came in very strong with companies such as williams reporting 2 , 000 % profit increases in their energy merchant segments . however , for many of the smaller players it was a tough year . "" the big news here is probably the price pressure the marketers have had to withstand , "" said ben schlesinger , president of maryland - based consulting firm schlesinger and associates , which tracks energy marketing . "" these people have price exposure on both sides of their business : the buy side and sell side . they ' ve actively sought to hedge these risks , but there ' s no question that there have been some real stresses in their businesses as a result of quadrupling gas prices in 2000 . "" significant shuffling has begun to take place and will continue , not just among the leadership but among the whole roster of 500 marketing companies , predicted schlesinger . "" for the first time i ' m not sure all 500 will make it because of the price volatility , and the stresses that it creates on their balance sheets and their ability to meet the different needs of their customers . "" if you are on the wrong side of a transaction these days in california , you are going to suffer significantly . it ' s not much different at the henry hub either , he noted . the harsh reality is that only the strong will survive . ronald j . barone of ubs warburg believes the california energy crisis and fears of lack of gas supply and capacity are driving customers to the strongest marketers . "" i think that over the long term it will be a positive for the bigger players , such as enron . customers want to go with somebody who is big , has facilities , somebody who is going to guarantee it , somebody who can do risk management for them . enron is the 800 - pound gorilla here . "" enron has been the 800 - pound gorilla in gas marketing for years but there were always plenty of 750 - pound gorillas around . last year , however , enron found a way to trade natural gas over the internet and at last glance was well over 1 , 600 pounds , more than double the size of its next closest rival gorilla , duke energy . enron sold 23 . 8 bcf / d of gas last year compared to only 13 . 3 bcf / d the year prior and compared to the 11 . 9 bcf / d sold by duke energy , which came in second place in ngi ' s ranking of gas marketers by physical sales volume . enron catapulted itself to the next level with the help of its handy new tool , enrononline , its web - based proprietary energy and commodity trading system that now handles about 3 , 000 mainly natural gas transactions each day . in 2000 , enron completed its first full year of deploying enrononline , which quickly became the world ' s largest web - based e - commerce site . during the year , enron executed 548 , 000 transactions online with 3 , 000 customers , totaling $ 336 billion of gross value . the tremendous success of enrononline led many observers to wonder whether market concentration was beginning to take place in the industry . when you look at enron ' s massive increase in wholesale transactions you have to wonder about that concentration . enron ' s 23 . 8 bcf / d is pretty large ( 35 % ) when compared with the 69 bcf / d that is actually consumed in north america . but you have to factor in multiple trades - - - one marketer trades a given molecule of gas to another marketer and so on . according to schlesinger , the so - called "" churning factor "" is close to three . "" in the past several years when we ' ve been polling marketers , we got numbers ( in 1999 ) that came to about 60 tcf . we added up all the physical sales by all the marketing companies . we did not have 100 % response in our survey - - - some of the mid - sized and smaller companies didn ' t respond . we reasonably extrapolated that about 65 tcf , maybe even 70 tcf of gas was traded each year in north america . physical consumption in north america is about 25 tcf so 70 divided by 25 is about 2 . 8 . "" using that calculation , enron with 23 . 8 bcf / d of physical gas sales in 2000 ends up with a not unreasonable 12 % market share . when the federal trade commission looks at markets and market share , it uses several tools , one of which is the herschman - herfindahl index , a measure of market concentration . it ' s the sum of the squares of the market share of each participant . if one company owns the entire 100 % of the market , that ' s an hhi of 10 , 000 . the department of justice has been using 1 , 800 as a red flag when it considers approval of mergers and acquisitions . according to schlesinger , the total gas industry has an hhi of only about 200 , way below any suggestion of market concentration . "" it ' s so low that it ' s unbelievable . it ' s a highly competitive business . even if one competitor has 12 % of the market ( hhi of 144 ) and the next competitor has 6 % and on down , it certainly doesn ' t send up any red flags , "" he said . "" it could be that market concentration in the gas industry has risen a bit in 2000 , but this information alone would not diminish the fact that the industry is one of the most competitive businesses in the united states . however , there may be some regional issues we have to think about , "" he added . "" we haven ' t looked at that , so i can ' t comment on whether anyone has undue market power in a particular region or state , for example . "" there is a snowball effect going on among the top marketers . the leaders keep getting larger . volume growth averages at least 10 % per year or more . several factors should fuel future growth . price increases , volatility and uncertainty of supplies are driving buyers to the larger marketers , according to both schlesinger and barone . online trading has become a new springboard for additional growth by allowing greater efficiency and many more trades to take place . schlesinger said he believes electronic trading was responsible for a good part the 17 % increase in volumes . enron attributed much of its growth to the online business . according to some observers , online trading still has plenty of room to grow . altra energy ceo paul bourke believes about 30 % of all gas trading now takes place over the internet . bourke said altra had 8 , 000 natural gas trades on its system in december . however barone predicts there eventually will be a slowdown in gas marketing growth in the united states as international energy markets grab the attention of many marketers . "" international should pick up the slack and contribute increasingly to the bottom line , "" he said . barone also expects the current market situation and the continued interest in service , supply and commodity versatility to continue driving marketing companies together . "" i think size , scope and scale are incredibly significant . "" only one of the top 20 major marketers last year resulted from the combination of two separate predecessors : axia , which grew out of the combination of koch energy and entergy . the rest of the group achieved its growth without major acquisitions or mergers . thirteen out of the 20 top marketers showed double - or triple - digit volume growth with only two companies in the minus column . pg & e had the largest volume deterioration of any of the large marketers with a 40 . 1 % decline in annual volumes and a 42 % decline in quarterly volumes . pg & e went through a significant reorganization last year . the move of its national energy group ( neg ) to bethesda , md , from houston , had the greatest impact on its trading activity . but the company also sold its energy services business and its texas gas transmission assets among other changes . "" it really slowed down our trading [ and ] a large number of people stayed behind in houston , "" said company spokesman patrick hurston . at the time of the move , the company estimated about half , or 100 , would make the move . hurston wouldn ' t say how many actually made the trip , but the company is still actively hiring . transcanada , which also underwent a massive reorganization last year , was the other company in the minus column with a 3 % decline in sales volume . the remainder of the group experienced large increases in volumes : enron at 94 % , duke with 15 % growth , sempra with 51 % and bp amoco with 100 % growth .",Safe Email

We All
Need a Good Attorney to Call in Today's Society.
Keeping ahead of the legal issues in our life was just simply more than we could
bear. We needed legal advice and we needed it right away. Unfortunately, being middle class, put us in the wrong income bracket to have such a necessity. Now all of this has changed.
Think about the issues that can suddenly come up in your personal life:Monday: The dog bit the mailman - Do you know what to do?
Tuesday:  The Building Inspector drops by and announces that the permits on file with their office do not
    allow your garage conversion. ""What now,"" you think to yourself.
Wednesday: You've been considering home-schooling your children for some time. Now your daughter announces that she is being picked on yet again, and simply will not attend another day. What are the legal ramifications of home schooling your children?Â 
Thursday: Speeding Ticket goes to warrant for your 17-year-old son. You haven't a clue how to handle
    it.Â 
Friday:  Your ex-spouse has missed another child support payment. . . Who do you call?And what about all the other things:Received a Traffic Ticket You Thought Was Unjustified?
Paid a Bill You Knew Was Unfair?
Lost a Security Deposit?
Bought a Home or Purchased A Car?
Signed an Employment Contract?
Had difficulty collecting an insurance claim?
Had Trouble With Your Credit Report?
Been Involved in a Landlord or Property Dispute?
Been Involved in a separation or divorce?
Had to Collect Child Support?
Prepared A Will or Wanted To?
In your personal life, you need legal representation available to you all the time. But most of us never have it because we can't afford it.Now there is a program that not only provides quality legal help,
 but it provides it 24 hours a day, with an attorney helping you the same day you call them -
 and it is for a small monthly fee. No Kidding.  Somewhere between twenty and forty dollars a month, depending upon the plan you choose.

"http://www.quitpalestine.org./Funny as all hell.  So a group of 25 QUIT (Queers Undermining Israeli
Terrorism) marched into the local starbucks in Berkeley (Of course,
they pick a safe city like Berkeley, but hey, still funny) and
'settle' driving away straights and other prior inhabitants with
supersoakers :)Incredibly creative, in my opinion. Not terribly violent (I mean, how
much damage can you -really-  do with a supersoaker?) but definintely
a newscatcher.Its nice to see folks are finding some creative means to make a point.

"why i love unverifiable voting machines , by the prez . how i stole your election by george w . bush the first thing i did to steal your election was to make friends with all the manufacturers and code - verifyers of the electronic voting machines . they were really nice , especially diebold who gave me $ 600 , 000 for my campaign . wow , thanks dude ! next , i had my attack dog , karl rove , convince these companies to either alter the vote totals on the central tabulator machines ( simple pcs running windows using remote access server - - ras ) , or reprogram ( via a downloadable software patch ) the voting machines themselves so that they would give the advantage to me ! isn ' t america great ? ! ? a little money and some religious zealotry goes a looooong , loooong way . oh , the religious zealotry thing ? that ' s just a cover . i ' m not really a christian - - or at least i don ' t act like one . anyway , i digress . did you ever hear the media complaining about how inaccurate the exit polls were in prior elections ? no . that ' s because they basically are accurate . but this election , the exit polls showed kerry way ahead . no problem . my buddies rigged the machines ( and all they needed to do was rig it in one state , ohio , but they took care of at least florida for me too ) not only to make me squeak by in the important battleground states , like florida and ohio , but they also made sure that when i did get a state that i was expected to win , the margin was huge so that my popular vote would make it look like i had a mandate . so let ' s recap how the popular vote thing worked again . let ' s say we didn ' t want it to look suspicious by taking states that kerry really would have won ( except for ohio and florida , gotta take those ! heh heh ) . so we let him win there , but in order once again to boost the popular vote ( i put that in quotes because as you know , i ' m not really popular ) , we bring my vote tallies right up next to kerry ' s , to jack up the popular vote as much as possible , even if i didn ' t win the state . then , with states like north carolina , we know we ' re going to steal the state anyway ( at least according to what the exit polls were telling everyone . . . . and according to the long , long lines of new voters were telling everyone . . . because we all know most of those people were voting for kerry , not the status quo ) , so we just jack the crap out of the vote total to really stuff a crapload of popular votes in my pocket . you see , this way i can get on the tv and declare that i have a mandate and that i ' m going to cash in on my political capital ( which i don ' t really have of course , but we made it look that way ) . here ' s a nice chart to show you what i mean . take special note of how the electronic voting machine totals compare to the paper ballot totals . and see what i mean about north carolina ? look folks , if you really want me out of office , first you ' re going to have to impeach me . but you know what , if you don ' t have verifiable paper trails at the polls like these folks recommend ( http : / / . org / ) , and if you don ' t take these voting machines out of the hands of private companies that are aligned with one end of the political spectrum , then i ' m gonna just continue to hose you ( and then my brother jeb will be president too cause we ' re into this dynasty thing , kind of like my buddies the saudis . . . ain ' t it cool ? ! ? ) . also , in 2006 , we ' re going to steal about five more senate seats , and then we ' ll have the super - majority . that means the democrats can ' t do that confounded fillerbs . . . fillas . . . . fillbusters . . . . crap , well , they can ' t get in the darn way any more and we can pass any laws we want about anything and put whoever we want on the supreme court . ha ha , then you ' re really screwed . so if you don ' t fix this mess ( i mean great system ) in two years and have a verifiable voting system nationwide , america is mine ! ! ! ! ! ( and jeb ' s and my daddy ' s and cheney ' s and rove ' s . . . hey , we could even pass a law saying i could be president for four more years after 2008 ! that would be sooo cool ! ) anyway , i digress once again . and that pesky bev harris . man i wish she would go away . if too many of you contribute to her cause , i might just get in trouble so knock it off ! ! http : / / www . blackboxvoting . org / i ' ve said it before and i ' ll say it again , fool me once . . . . . , oh crap , i forgot again . well how about this ? this would be a heck of lot easier if this was [ grammar incorrect ] a dictatorship . . . . just so long as i ' m the dictator . heh , heh . well , sorry to say folks , but i got my way . what are you gonna do about it , huh ? bring it on ! ! ! sincerely yours , president george w . bush p . s . pass it on ! i dare ya .",Phishing Email

Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple â€œ3â€ Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:â€œTo whom it may concern,I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70â€™s & 80â€™s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?Sincerely,RJâ€Location: Midwest, U.S.A.â€œThank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.â€-- Frankie R.Location: West Coast, USAâ€œIâ€™m a man of my 40â€™s and I really know my stuff.  I donâ€™t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple â€œ3â€.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70â€™s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!â€  -- A.J.Location: United Kingdom

I can copy the RedHat official download ISO's. I can't
call it redhat if I sell it, so I can give you copies
of thread linux 7.3 if you want.Failing that, I have the 7 CD's from Woody (Debian 3.0).

"cost - effective mlm / bizop phone - screened leads hello , premium phone qualified business opportunity leads if you ' re spending money marketing a business opportunity or mlm , you will definitely be interested in what we have to offer you . you ' re tired of blindly spending money for leads and not having any idea what kind of response you ' ll get from it . sometimes calling 100 people without one single signup ! sometimes talking to people who have been bombarded by bizop pitches to the point of them hanging up when you call ! ( leads oversold ) we ' re here to help ! we ' ll get you qualified leads for your mlm or business opportunity . period . no qualifiers , no conditions , no nonsense . we ' ll do it quickly , and professionally . and we won ' t ask you for a single dime without guaranteeing results ! here ' s how we generate our leads . . . - all of these leads are generated in - house ! - one source we use for lead - generation is a business opportunity seeker lead list of people who have requested info . about making extra income from home by either filling out an online questionnaire , or responding to an email ad , classified ad , postcard , etc . , . - the other source we use is an automated call center . we have computerized software that dials up local residents , plays a recorded message asking them if they ' re interested in making money from home . if they are , the system records their name and phone number for us to call back and qualify . - the prospects that come from either of the above sources are then phone interviewed by us , here in our offices and the following info . is asked ( after confirming their desire to find an opportunity ) : name : email : phone : best time to call : state : reason they want to work from home ! : how much they want to make per month : how much time they can commit per week : how much money they have available for startup : if they see an opportunity , how soon they would get started : we ' ll close by telling them they ' ll be contacted by no more than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities . - then the leads are submitted to a website we set up for you , from which the results are then forwarded to you by email . - this way , you get the leads fresh , and in * real - time * ( only minutes old ) . never more than 24 hours old . guaranteed ! - we guarantee that you ' ll receive at least a valid name , phone number and the time - date stamp corresponding to when the lead was generated ! however , almost all leads will have all of the information asked above . benefits of our phone qualified lead generation system : 1 . they will be extremely qualified due to the nature of the qualifying questions that will be asked ( above ) . 2 . they are super - fresh ! delivered in real - time only moments after they are contacted and qualified ! ( not 30 - 120 days old ) 3 . they ' re targeted . each lead we generate originates from a targeted list of business opportunity seekers . 4 . they ' re highly receptive ! receptivity is very , very high because they aren ' t bombarded by tons of people pitching them on opportunities ! also they ' ll remember speaking to someone over the phone . especially since we tell them to expect your call ! 5 . no feast or famine activity . leads will be coming in regularly . you dictate the flow ! 6 . no more cold calls ! we tell your prospects you ' ll be calling . 7 . you can * personalize * your approach with the info . you get with each lead ! 8 . save time . naturally , better leads means less calls to get a sale . 9 . lower burnout factor . calling red - hot leads makes it easier to pick up the phone , day in and day out . 10 . you can sort your leads based on their responses and call the hottest ones first . 11 . you can get new reps started quicker using these leads due to higher closing ratios . of course , this builds faster and stronger momentum , and skyrockets new rep retention as a result of quick successes . 12 . the leads will be uniform - almost all leads will have the info . indicated above . ( all leads will have valid phone numbers . ) 13 . they ' re double - qualified because to generate the lead , a list of previous business opportunity seekers is used . 14 . excellent control of the flow of leads coming through . if you ' ve been trying to run things too long without a steady flow of high quality leads , call us now to get things in motion . just let us know what program you want to advertise and we ' ll create a customized lead - generation campaign for you . since your need to get business moving has probably never been more critical than it is today , why not call us now ! these are fresh , highly qualified leads because these people aren ' t just responding to some generic business opportunity ad , they ' re contacted over the phone specifically for your company ! and we forward you the leads within minutes of the lead being generated - not days , weeks , or months ! start generating as many sign - ups as you can handle ! explode your downline and income ! call for details and discount pricing ! toll free 1 - 866 - 853 - 8319 ext . 1 or email us here for full details to opt out click here - - - - this sf . net email is sponsored by : jabber - the world ' s fastest growing real - time communications platform ! don ' t just im . build it in ! http : / / www . jabber . com / osdn / xim spamassassin - sightings mailing list",Phishing Email

options and the UI does make it a lot easier to use for people who are
either not using it all the time or are just starting to use it. The
GNOME team decided that advanced users who want to edit the kinds of
options you talk about are advanced enough to use gconf-editor.
Personally, I'm fine with that, because I don't find gconf-editor hard
to use :)Julian

Tassos Papadopoulos, the Greek sculptor behind the plan, judged that the

         dangerously empty of sane postings, strewn with the rotting
         carcasses of broiling vacation messages. Hacktress and
         Silicon Valley's chief rat-keeper LILE ELAM, excitedly posts
         about a new open 802.11 network she's found. ""I am here at
         the police station waiting to see a judge and I thought I
         would check to see if there is connectivity"", she writes,
         somewhat recklessly, to the Bay Area Wireless list. Exit
         the rest of the Wifi community through the nearest window
         and out into the streets... where, cooling tempers, the
         Microsoft Palladium boys are on an endless summer tour,
         reassuring the experts that while, hmm, they *suppose* Pd
         could *theoretically* be used as a Hollywood DRM system,
         they truly have no plans to do any such thing. Cypherpunk
         and friend of freedom Lucky Green hears this; thinks up four
         or five of the obvious Palladium DRM implementations; sends
         them off to be patented in his name. Licensing funds, we
         imagine, will go on cracking his own DRMs. And so the mail
         loops on.

         headlights, wanton Dave Bird heckling, some industry bigwig
         fighting off the audience with a broken chairleg, and other
         epiphenomena of the interzone between legal minds and hacker
         ethics. Oh, and FIPR are still looking for a Programme
         Director, so if you're interested, let them know. We
         suggested a convention raffle (first prize: the director's
         job, second prize: Ross Anderson as your personal slave for

         that this weekend's multimedia performance of Jeff Wayne's WAR 
         OF THE WORLDS has been postponed due to ""health and safety 
         issues"". The event was to feature computer graphics, 
         fireworks, ""60ft-tall Martian fighting machines"" wreaking 
         ""havoc and destruction"", and - most terrifyingly of all - the 
         possibility of a David Essex tribute singer performing with 
         Hawkwind, but UKP18 tickets for the Sat 2002-08-31 show at 
         Manchester's Heaton Park will still be valid at a range of new 
         venues next summer. Ironically, the Martians' original 
         invasion plans were similarly thwarted by health and safety 
         issues, ""slain after all man's devices had failed by the 
         humblest creatures that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this 
         earth: bacteria. Minute, invisible, bacteria. For, directly

          Windows really *is* like the Sun. You have this big hulking
          mass of concentrated power in the middle, with a few small
          orbiting utilities - like WinZip, and PuTTY, and VNC.
          Occasionally one will get a bit too close to the OS, and
          Microsoft will suck it down and turn it into fuel for the
          System. One such discrete satellite remains FILEZILLA, the
          still-necessary ftp gui client for Windows. Those who know
          it won't need the introduction, although they might
          appreciate the note that it's getting close to v2.0 time.
          For dogged WS_FTP users, though, it's got multiple
          downloads, auto-restart of interrupted 'loads, queuing, and
          sftp and Kerberos support. It's also GPL'd which makes it a
          nice bit of source for anyone wanting to grok Win32

"re : 5 . 1404 comparative method in linguistics karl teeter is mistaken , i think , when he says that you cannot classify languages on the basis of phonological correspondences in the lexical items , when he says that you would treat english and french as related ( via the norman borrowings ) if you did this , when he says that the idea of using this method is "" novel "" , when he says that you can only classify lamnguages as related if you have written a comparative grammar , etc . ( a ) for many language families , there is no other basis for classification available , because they lack the kind of morphological complexity so beloved of indo - europeanists , algonkianists , and those other - ists who happen to enjoy its blessings in "" their "" languages , ( b ) the danger of confusing borrowings for cognates is always real , but it is easy to see that the lexical connaections of english with french are more transparent phonologically and less central semantically than those with dutch , hence more recent , hence borrowings . ( c ) there is nothing novel in what i am saying , since it is the method which , for example , edward sapir used to establish that the uto - aztecan languages are really a family ( rather than three families ) . ( d ) you cannot possibly realistically expect normal people to spend time writing comparative grammars of languages which have not previously been shown to be related . so classification must come first ! on the other hand , it is perfectly easy to write a "" crazy "" comparative grammar for any random group of languages , e . g . , french and english . the last is perhaps the most important point : reconstruction of morphological systems can be done well or badly , so can comparison of lexical items . both can yield correct results ; both can also produce garbage . p . s . i say ' lexical items ' deliberately , because there seem to be language families where there is no morphology at all to compare . in most cases , howveer , there are some bound morphemes , and one compares those as well ( as did sapir in the case of uto - aztecan ) . but this is a far cry from reconstructing the kind of intricate morphological patterns found in the older indo - european languages , for example , but absent from many other language families .",Safe Email

"Hello JustinThe simplest setup would be to connect a wireless access point to you
hub then use a wireless pcmcia network card in your laptop.  You could
also get some pcmcia to pci adapters or wireless pci network cards for
your desktop machines.The access point would be configured with a network name (essid) and a
channel number for you wireless network.  The client machine would be
configured with the same network name, it should be able to auto detect
the channel number.Driver support is very good, there are only a few wireless chipsets,
and I believe that all but the newest 802.11b Plus (22Mbps) and 802.11a
hardware has Linux drivers.If you need anymore help or info checkout the forums and irc channel at

Portland, Maine
Sunday, December 1, 2002Driver who hit moose fights county over meatBy GISELLE GOODMAN, Portland Press Herald Writer
------------------------------------------------------------------------
via http://www.lorencoleman.com
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTON Â‹ In her freezer at home, Lisa Pierce has ground beef and roasts,
frozen vegetables and french fries, even a couple of Popsicles. What she
doesn't have is the meat of the moose she hit and killed with her car on
Nov. 5, the moose that was rightfully hers, but instead went to a neighbor.The lack of it has her embroiled in a fight with the York County Sheriff's
Department to get back what she says she is owed.""I think the deputy thought he was doing me a favor,"" said Pierce. ""I'm a
woman and he just neglected to think that I would want it. The moose is
gone, I know that now. I want to be compensated for the meat.""Whether or not that happens is uncertain. Her experience, though, highlights
a law some Mainers may not be aware of, but should get to know during this
peak time of deer-versus-car accidents, as the animals, in their mating
season, come out of the woods.The law is simple: A big-game carcass caught by a car - be it a moose, deer
or bear - goes to the person who hits it, as long as a law enforcement
officer is called to the scene and the vehicle is damaged in the accident.It comes up quite often in Maine, say officials. Last year, there were 4,055
cases of vehicles and deer colliding on Maine roads and 600 accidents
involving moose, according to Mark Latti, spokesman for the Maine Warden
Service.""In a state of what, 1.4 million, with only 215,000 licensed hunters, I
don't know how many motor vehicle drivers would know how to dress out a
moose,"" said Latti. ""You do have the option of keeping it.""Which, for some people, can be valuable compensation for a damaged car.
Farm-grown deer meat can retail for $8 to $20 per pound in stores. And a
butchered or dressed moose, which can't be bought or sold anywhere in Maine,
can produce hundreds of pounds of food.Latti said when it comes to moose, the law has been abused since its
inception in 1991. Every now and then an officer will issue a summons to a
driver for intentionally killing a moose with a car. That kind of ""hunting""
makes no sense to Latti.Hitting a moose, even at a slow speed, is no laughing matter. Large adult
moose can weigh up to 1,500 pounds and can be more than 9 feet tall. Since
the bulk of their weight is above the hood level of most cars, their bodies
often come crashing through windshields in collisions. More often than not,
crashes like these damage the vehicle, the people inside and the animal.Sometimes they are fatal. In 1998, Latti said, there were six moose-related
fatalities. After that, when the number of moose-hunting permits went from
2,000 to 3,000, there were less. Maine had three moose-related fatalities in
2000, one in 2001 and two this year so far, said Stephen McCausland,
spokesman for the Maine Public Safety Department.Pierce considers herself lucky that she and the three children in her car
did not become part of that statistic early on Election Day. But she also
feels cheated by the whole situation. After all, her car was totaled.On the morning of the accident, Pierce was taking her two children and a
neighbor's son to school in her 1991 Dodge Dynasty. She said she was going
along at about 35 mph on a well-traveled road, when a moose came out of
nowhere.""By the time my brain could see moose, he was part of my windshield,"" she
said. Pierce is well aware of the law, so as she sat in the ambulance with the
children, being treated for cuts and bruises, she thought about the moose.
But the four of them were transferred to the hospital before she could deal
with it, so she said she wasn't able to follow up on the animal until later
that day.When she inquired, she was told the deputy on the scene gave the
fully-racked bull moose to a neighbor who showed up with a tractor.Her neighbor, she said, subsequently offered her the moose for the $100 it
took him to carry it away, money she didn't think she should spend. By the
time she contacted the Attorney General's Office on Nov. 12 to complain
about the deputy giving her moose away, the neighbor's price had gone up
another $300 for the cost of butchering 450 pounds of meat.And when she called York County Chief Deputy Maurice Ouellette to complain
that she should be compensated for the moose because it was the officer's
fault that she didn't have it, Ouellette told her he could not give her cash
and the best he could do was to give her the next moose struck in York
County.""At that point in time it became an issue of not wanting moose anymore, but
wanting money,"" Ouellette said.That conversation, and a similar one she had with York County Sheriff Phil
Cote, left Pierce enraged and she now feels the issue has gone beyond the
moose.But the circumstances that brought her to this point are not surprising to
other officials.""It's the officer's discretion,"" said Latti. ""And if the officer feels the
person can't immediately remove (the animal), he's got to think of public
safety and other people on the roadway. If someone is worried about her
children in her car, the last thing a law enforcement officer wants to ask
is if she wants the moose.""Maine State Police Trooper Jeremy Forbes said when he arrives at accidents
that involve a serious injury to a person, the issue of who gets the animal,
deer or moose, becomes secondary.""The priorities are the injuries and getting people to the hospital,"" he
said. ""If they are really hurt and going to the hospital, the animal can't
wait, so we'll probably give it to the next person who stops by.""This is not comforting to Pierce. She said the deputy could have come to the
ambulance and asked her what she wanted to do with the moose. With her
boyfriend, a hunter, nearby, she could have easily taken care of the animal
herself.She knows her situation is probably a lost cause. But she hopes other
people, especially other women, do not have the same experience.""What about people who don't know the law?"" she said. ""Standing up for my
rights has just been a big headache.""Staff Writer Giselle Goodman can be contacted at 324-4888 or at:ggoodman@pressherald.com

Well it looks pretty much 99% sure that we will be moving in on Nov 1 to
the new house. I think the only thing that stops us now are acts of
dieties and total economic collapse..so no one mention the dow for the
next few weeks..In preperation we drove to Best Buy tonight and picked up the test core
for the wifi net. I got a linksys BEFW11S4(1) for the router/hub/wireless
ap/firewall/etc and a linksys wifi pcmcia card for the laptopI made one false move so it took about 30 mins all told to set up the
card, the router, and the other 3 machines in the house on the wire ether
hub. All vfery neat very easy and very very cool set up via the
webinterface. I have to dig into the firewall/nat/routing features some
more (i have been reading up the wifi security blackpaper on ars technica)
but all in all a smooth move.
Now the place im at now, the house soon to be the ex house, has lots of
funky things going on in the walls and in the area. We are in ,
essentialy, a gravel pit..recption of all types suck and transmisions get
goofy inside the pit.  That being said... with 2 walls and 40 feet between
the AP and the pcmica card (no external antena on it) Im still getting
11mbs and at least 60% goodness.
Some cool things about the new house...its a 1912 job so no metal works
inthe walls to speak of , mostly wood and plaster. We dont have a
microwave and our cordless phines are on 900mhz (yea so I can use my bear
cat to listen in on some calls, with kids in the house is that such a bad
thing? Ben or heather, if you read this years from now...well by then I
hope youare better at countermoeasures:)- )Ok, enough testing for tonight. I gota say, being able to do this in bed
by vncing via wifi to my desktop is a blast...oh no...wifes pillow is
heading this way....DUCKKKKK

"fw : fyi - more on truck s / d vince : i ' d like to send you some articles on the fleet card business . if you have some time , i ' d like to discuss the meeting that we had with comdata ( which has a 60 % market share of the fleet card business ) . they have some live data that potentially could be very interesting ; however , i ' d like to discuss it with you . shawn what a mess ! ( statistical data included ) john d . schulz 03 / 26 / 2001 traffic world page 25 copyright 2001 gale group inc . all rights reserved . copyright 2001 journal of commerce , inc . truckers still waiting for signs of pent - up freight demand ; earnings shortfalls , layoffs loom if you are waiting for trucking to kick - start the nation ' s economic recovery , pull up a chair and wait awhile . trucking ceos say they haven ' t seen this slow a first quarter in a decade . "" perhaps the weakest first quarter for freight demand since swift became a public company in 1990 , "" phoenix - based swift transportation chairman and ceo jerry moyes said . the first - quarter trucking mantra historically has been this : everybody loses money in january , hopes for a break - even february and earns whatever profit there is in the quarter in march . that formula may not hold this year . gregory l . quesnel , president and ceo of con - way transportation services and emery worldwide parent cnf inc . , said the current slowdown was first detected late in the third quarter last year and has become "" more pronounced in each successive quarter . "" march , he said , has been "" as disappointing as the first two months this year . "" layoffs already are occurring at the major ltl carriers . yellow freight system has idled as many as 1 , 000 teamsters and hundreds of white - collar back - office workers . most large carriers are warning of profit shortfalls that will cause them to miss analysts ' first - quarter estimates . but there are deeper fears , too . marginal players may be forced into bankruptcy . small , family - owned carriers may be unable to exit the industry on their own terms because of the shocking decline in the value of used trucks that is causing some companies to be valued at less than half their worth of just two years ago . swift ' s volume drop - off began with shipments originating on the west coast in january and february and it is continuing in march , moyes said . coupled with reduced demand from the southwest , moyes said swift will not meet analysts ' first - quarter earnings expectations . swift is not alone . "" we hauled less freight in february than february a year ago , "" said bob hammel , executive vice president of pittsburgh - based pitt ohio express , a leading privately held eastern regional ltl carrier . "" the slowdown in manufacturing began in the middle of last year and it was precipitous . nobody anticipated the speed in which manufacturing demand fell off . "" even con - way , the most profitable ltl operation in the past five years , said it would have a decline in first - quarter operating income compared with the year - ago period . con - way ' s tonnage declines were estimated in the "" mid - single - digit "" percentage range . roadway express estimated that its current tonnage levels are running 10 to 11 percent below those a year ago , which will result in an approximately one - half of 1 percent ( 0 . 5 percent ) decline in its operating ratio . ( see sidebar ) pat hanley , overnite transportation ' s senior vice president and chief financial officer , said freight figures were flat in february year over year but rose slightly in march . overnite is the exception to the ltl industry with as many as 24 new terminals scheduled to be opened this year . "" january was pretty good to us , but february was flat . it ' s coming back in march . we ' re probably up in low single digits , 3 to 4 percent . we ' re picking back up . the economy has hurt us . if you had asked us at the start of the year , we ' d have said we ' d be up double - digits , "" hanley said . the national economic picture is "" a big concern , "" hanley said . "" we ' re not seeing pressure on prices , at least not so far . we ' re seeing customers ship 10 pallets a day instead of 20 . the shipment size is coming down . certainly we ' re concerned . we ' ll do o . k . , but not as great as we ' d like . "" forget consumer confidence surveys or the producer pricing index or whatever stars align in federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan ' s world . the genuine leading indicator of any national economic trend is trucking , which is always a first - in , first - out industry in any economic slowdown . to hear trucking industry leaders tell it , get comfortable with beans and franks for dinner . it ' s going to be awhile before it ' s filet mignon time again . shippers see what ' s happening as well but say it ' s still too early in the year for carriers to start cutting rates to fill empty trucks . "" all the carriers we talk with report flat or slightly declining business levels - - definitely slower than early last year , "" said bill huie , assistant vice president of corporate transportation for nch corp . , irving , texas . "" with a couple of exceptions , carriers we talk with have no plans for expansion in the next few months . we are getting feelers about some possible lane adjustments to boost revenue . but generally it appears a little early in the economic downturn for much price movement . "" the national ltl carriers are seeing the same things . "" our business is down pretty substantially for the first quarter , "" said roger dick , spokesman for yellow corp . , parent of yellow freight system and two large regional ltl carriers , jevic transportation , delanco , n . j . , and saia motor freight , duluth , ga . usfreightways corp . , citing what it called the nation ' s "" serious economic slowdown , "" said it expects first - quarter earnings to fall "" very substantially below "" current wall street consensus . extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating environment , usf chairman , president and ceo samuel k . skinner added . "" traditionally , the first quarter builds momentum slowly , with march being the strongest month of the period , "" skinner said in a statement . "" this year , the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of 2000 accelerated in january and february , softening even the normal modest expectations for those two months . "" it ' s not just the ltl industry that ' s hurting . the morgan stanley dean witter truckload freight index continues to show the worst demand - supply relationship since analyst james j . valentine began tracking the data in april 1994 . two events can cause weakness in the index , according to valentine . they are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak freight demand . "" so far in 2001 , we have seen the confluence of both factors , but the fall - off in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply , "" valentine wrote in his most recent "" trucking snapshot "" for early march . year - to - date measurement for truckload demand is down 25 percent year over year , according to valentine ' s index , while supply is up only 7 percent . that would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was "" masked by the strong economy , "" valentine says . in a more ominous note , valentine believes overcapacity will continue to plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years . only a reaccelerating national economy can bring the demand - supply back in balance for the truckload sector in the near term , valentine predicts . the overproduction of new class 8 trucks from early 1998 through early last year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at manufacturers , wholesalers and other retailers . used trucks have lost on average more than 30 percent of their value over the past 18 months . anecdotally , one used truck dealer , music city truck & equipment , in lavergne , tenn . , is holding a "" two - for - one "" sale on three - to five - year - old class 8 freightliners . you can buy two for around $ 30 , 000 , less than a brand new chevy suburban suv . what that means is a trucker who bought a 1998 class 8 truck for $ 70 , 000 and depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the books this year at $ 35 , 000 . but assuming it has lost 30 percent of that value , it may only be worth $ 24 , 500 in actuality . for a carrier with a 100 - truck fleet , that equates to a loss of more than $ 1 million on assets . the glut may last for a while , according to valentine ' s analysis . assuming a three - year trade - in cycle , most of the class 8 tractors in the truckload sector are just now rolling over to the used - truck market . that means that overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year . that will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business , as did nearly 1 , 900 carriers last year that either closed or declared bankruptcy . "" we can see from indexes , surveys and other information available to us that it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in march and freight demands will continue to be soft throughout the month . based on all of these factors , we expect usfreightways ' profits for the first quarter to be very substantially less than published analysts ' forecasts , "" skinner said . in addition , severe weather conditions including an earthquake in seattle , rainstorms in california and blizzards in the northeast have added cost and decreased efficiencies , skinner added . expectations at each of usf ' s operating companies have been affected , some more than others . the ltl , logistics , reverse logistics and freight - forwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a similar period last year , skinner said . further job cuts at usf worldwide , its freight forwarder , would be in the offing as cost controls at the unit would be "" accelerated "" in the wake of the softening economy , skinner said . late last year , skinner said the rebuilding process at usf worldwide would be a two - year process . but the worsening economy has made that rebuilding job harder , he said . "" we are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is , in fact , further impeding progress in this area , "" skinner said . "" during the fourth quarter of 2000 and continuing into the first quarter of 2001 , the company has taken steps to increase cost efficiencies . among these actions are a substantial cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force . these cost - control efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions . "" in the 2000 first quarter , usf posted $ 22 . 3 million net income , a 27 percent rise from the $ 17 . 5 million earnings in the 1999 first quarter . at the time , that was usf ' s 15 th straight quarter - over - quarter earnings increase . it came on $ 608 . 2 million revenue , an 18 . 5 percent rise in from the $ 513 . 2 million revenue in the 1999 first quarter . analysts had been estimating usf to earn about $ 3 . 50 a share earnings for 2001 , compared with actual $ 3 . 61 earnings per share for all of last year . in the fourth quarter last year , usf earned $ 23 . 7 million , or 91 cents a share . trucking in a snapshot market what ' s going on msdw [ * ] truckload remains in record - low territory , indicating freight index the worst demand - supply relationship since msdw began tracking the date in april 1994 . diesel prices diesel prices in the first quarter of 2001 have come down 6 % sequentially from 4 qo 0 . however , the average price for the quarter remains 6 % above that of lqo 0 . wti oil opec recently agreed to reduce supply by 5 % and has stated a price objective of $ 25 per barrel . capacity retail sales of class 8 tractors ( new trucks entering the market ) came down in january , but inventory ( trucks that will enter the market at some point ) to sales ratio hit a new high of 3 . 4 months gdp 4 qo 0 gdp increased 1 . 1 % and economists see u . s . recession in 2001 with + 0 . 5 % and - 1 . 4 % gdp forecast for lqol and 2 qol , respectively . retail sales retail sales rose 0 . 7 % in january . while this was better than forecast , the upside was likely the result of excessive clearance sales after a disappointing holiday season . consumer the conference board ' s measure of consumer confidence confidence fell again ( nine points ) in february after registering the largest one - month decline in 10 years in january ( 14 points ) . napm the february napm rose slightly to 41 . 9 . however , it still indicates a contracting manufacturing sector . leading the index of leading economic indicators economic rose 0 . 8 % in january , while indicator msdw had forecast a 0 . 6 % increase . this represents the first rise in four months . stock after a recent pullback , trucking stocks remain perfonnance up year - to - date with tl stocks up 5 % , regional ltl stocks up 9 % and national ltl stocks up 13 % . investor for the week ended february 28 , mutual fund outflows totaled $ 309 million , compared with inflows of $ 2 billion in the prior week . market implications msdw [ * ] truckload negative for all tl carriers . freight index diesel prices the downward trend is positive for all carriers , especially tl carriers , which have greater exposure to fuel than ltl carriers . wti oil negative for all carriers , as $ 25 per barrel is still 25 % higher than the $ 20 per barrel average since 1990 . capacity negative for tl carriers , not a major concern for ltl carriers , which measure capacity by the number of terminals . gdp negative for all carriers . retail sales negative for both ti and ltl carriers . consumer negative for all carriers confidence napm negative for all carriers . leading positive for all carriers . economic indicator stock positive , however , stocks could pull perfonnance back further in the short term as fundamentals catch up . investor negative . source : morgan stanley dean witter research",Safe Email

Date: 2002-09-24T20:38:57-05:00_Jeffrey Zeldman_: OS X Blues update[1].     A couple of intellectuals have pointed out parallels between the rigidity 
    of OS X, which derives its power from Unix and XML, and the rules of 
    standards-based web development, which also compels you to do things the 
    right way instead of using five different non-standard hacks. The parallel 
    is not without merit. Building web pages the right way is hard at first, 
    but once you get it, you never want to go back. Regardless, we miss OS 9's 
    flexibility and ease of use, and a metric ton of logic doesn't offset that

evidence to the contrary. I thought the original question was a bit
strange...On that note: is there any real benefit to using hard links? I avoid them as
a rule, and cannot think of any good reason to use them at the moment.- Matthew

"broker client louise - - in response to some considerable concern voiced by presto , we are re - evaluating our broker client relationships . i ' m planning to send the following email to each of the desk heads . it is intended primarily to generate feedback from the desks , but my ultimate plan is to shut down the relationships and essentially start over with the desks making the transaction decisions instead of eol . before i launched it , i wanted to get your thoughts . thanks , brad earlier this year , enron executed deals with certain broker ' s which allows the broker to execute transactions for their clients via a broker client which is linked to the enrononline platform . all executions done on broker client are free of brokerage charges . to date , about 80 % of the 3 , 400 broker trades executed on - line have been in the us power segment . the companies that have access to read and execute transactions using the broker client are as follows : apb energy , inc . ( canadian nat gas , canadian power , us nat gas , us power , us coal , us emissions , us weather , us crude , us bandwidth ) natsource llc ( us nat gas , us power , canadian nat gas , us coal , us emissions ) amerex natural gas i , ltd . ( asian crude , bandwidth , us crude , us nat gas , belgian nat gas , canadian nat gas , european crude ) amerex power , ltd . ( australian power , austrian power , bandwidth , canadian power , dutch power , german power , nordic power , spanish power , swiss power , uk power , us power ) power merchants group , llc ( us financial nat gas ) prebon energy , inc . ( us nat gas , canadian nat gas , us power , canadian power , us coal , us emissions , us crude ) prebon marshall yamane ( uk ) ltd ( uk gas , uk power , continental power , continental gas , european crude , european weather , asian weather , asian crude , european bandwidth ) natsource tullett europe limited ( uk nat gas , uk power , continental gas , continental power , european coal ) gfi energynet llc ( us nat gas , us power , canadian gas , canadian power ) tfs energy , llc ( us nat gas , us power , canadian nat gas , canadian power , us bandwidth ) a significant concern has been raised that these relationships have amounted to a free option on the part of the brokers , who will transact with enron on long - dated product only if they can ' t find an equal or better price from a supplier who will pay brokerage . while i am confident that this possibility was discussed when the deals were struck , the current situation calls for some changes . accordingly , our plan would be to exercise our right to shut down all broker clients immediately . as a result , we would be forced to return approximately $ 1 . 2 mm in fees paid by the brokers listed above . let me be clear that this does not preclude future broker client arrangements . the decision to engage in future deals should be made on a commodity - by - commodity and region - by - region basis . in other words , we can grant access to whichever product types the desks feel comfortable with . if particular desks have broker relationships that they would like to move on - line in support of their market , the technology and resources are available to make this happen . what we are currently seeking is simply a reset on the broker client product so that we are not employing a "" one - size - fits - all "" solution . i would welcome your thoughts and comments on this course of action before we decide to proceed . thanks , brad richter",Safe Email

Date: Not suppliedPro football players are addicted to football games, as a means of 
wish-fulfillment -- by ""managing"" the team, they can be free of the rule of 
their coaches and bosses. Maybe this explains the amazing success of The Sims, 
which, on the face of it, should be dull as hell: While away your free time 
away from the office by simulating an existence as a shlub with a day-job and a 
drive to acquire consumer goods on credit. You'd think it'd be the last thing 
you want to do. But it's not. When you're a Sim, you can tweak your existence a 
smidge, discover what life would be like if you took Path A instead of Path B, 
try the alternate universe on for size. The idea of football players playing 
themselves in licensed video games is neat and recursive, like the episode of 
the Simpsons when Mr. Burns runs into Krusty buying Krusty-O's at the 
supermarket and asks where he can find the ""Burns-O's.""     ""It's always a trip,"" Carr says. ""The first time I saw myself in a video 
    game was in college (at Fresno State) when I walked into a Best Buy store 
    and some kid was playing with me. That kind of trips you out a little bit."" 
        For every 12-year-old kid who spends countless hours in front of a 
    television playing video games, there's a group of 300-pound offensive 
    linemen challenging each other at everything from Madden NFL 2003 to the 
    action-packed ""Halo: Combat Evolved.""  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Lawrence[3]!_)[1] http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/sports/1604474

"" the record jacket says that the record was produced "" to provide a tool of the actor 's craft , "" and for use in classrooms . i find it fascinating , and believe it will be extremely valuable to me . ( 2 ) a collection of cassettes with accompanying manual , entitled "" acting with an accent , "" by david a . stern . these are also aimed at actors who need to portray non-native english speakers . however , i found most of them not to be useful as classroom materials ; they stereotype the two or three most prominent pronunciation features of the various speakers when speaking english , rather than providing students with a real understanding of dialect , nor even of phonological interference mechanisms in second language learning . my other responses and comments are interpolated in the quotations , within [ ] . apologies for the length of this summary . louis b . hillman lbhndp @ rit . edu - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i ' ve found quite a lot of tapes that are available commercially as supplements ( bought separately ) to the following books : j . c . wells , accents of english . cambridge up 1992 .

specific, anyway.I am sure it would be possible to do an automated install with a few script
changes. I would not be surprised if Debian does this already.I do know that if you pass extra parameters on the boot command, they are
picked up by silo. So:
  boot disk linuxwould not prompt for selection but would boot straight through. From there
it is a matter of tftp'ing the correct config file and the install would be
automatic from there on.> I don't see why this should be a _major problem. The prom (ie the ""ok""

> (sorry couldn't resist!)The problem is that the time between linux booting and when the console tty
drivers are started can be a black hole, without error messages or log in
prompts. The other problem is that sometimes Linux will drop in to the PROM
on shutdown instead of powering off or rebooting. Without a serial cable or
keyboard it is not possible to reboot the box without flicking the power
switch hidden at the back of the case.I think if the console is ttya/ttyS0 it will drop into PROM. If it is
/dev/null then you do not get console messages but the box will shut down
properly.- Matthew

In my experience Windows will change the hardware clock the first time
you boot into it after the clocks have gone forward/back an hour.  This
will only happen twice a year. How to stop it, I have not checked (I
just switch the clock back an hour from within windows after such a
reboot).  Is there a GMT windows timezone?With ntp, it is a big no-no (afaik) to have other programs messing with
the clock as it will put ntp's calculations of drift etc., out. (maybe
this only applies to chrony, which is what I use).  If the windows
change only moves forward an hour, and you shift back an hour, maybe ntp
will be (relatively) ok (depends if all the remaining digits of time
precision are left unchanged, probably they aren't exactly).

The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Compan!
y.Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.

"typology of historical change typology of historical change this note tries to make explicit what i take for granted , and have discussed with others on occasion , but which perhaps needs a more explicit statement . one of the most fruitful avenues of research in distant language comparison , i believe , is the growth of the field i call typology of historical change . under this rubric i include for example the work of johanna nichols ( whether or not i agree with any data , findings or particulars of method , is not relevant to my point ; i still think it helps our thinking along ) . i also include , and this is a challenge i want to issue , the * * * mode of discourse * * * in which mr . vovin asked recently for help in finding typological parallels to a hypothesis he was interested in that a phrase meaning "" water falls "" could fossilize ( ? ) into a basic word for "" rain "" . in response to his query , he got back some positive answers , examples which people claimed fit this description . as a method of reasoning , this is what we need more of . that is , more accumulations of attested examples of particular changes , to educate our intuitions of what we naively think are "" possible "" semantic shifts by ever more experience with what actual semantic shifts are known or suspected . it will help us to improve our methods of guestimating possible language relationships , because it will at least say that a given hypothesized semantic shift is frequently attested , so it is not straining to compare lexical items whose meanings differ in such and such a way . whereas by contrast another hypothesized semantic shift is not firmly attested . so such an unattested semantic shift should probably not be used in those distant language comparisons which are themselves the most difficult to do , because over large time spans the number of context-sensitive conditioning environments is as great as the number of lexical items available to compare , and thus there are few or no * * * recurring * * * sound correspondences . in other words , as we move towards deeper comparisons , we must more and more rely on ways of measuring "" distance "" of semantic shift and "" distance "" of phonological change , rather than measuring repeating sound correspondences and semantic identities . we do not yet have our tools for doing this very well sharpened , but we can proceed gradually to sharpen them . a study of the known attested cases is the best start . in other words , if someone really wants to see how our methods fare with gradually more distant language comparisons , and to see how some new methods may fare , they should tabulate , for all known language relationships , ( a ) the proportion of sound-correspondence repetition in the comparable vocabulary ( and what "" comparable "" means is itself a variable , not exclusively defined by ( b ) and ( c ) ) ( b ) the "" semantic distance "" along attested paths of semantic change of lexical items being compared . where multiple such shifts have been attested , the estimated "" distance "" counts as closer , smaller . where few such shifts have been attested , the estimated "" distance "" counts as greater . we of course do not have enough such information in database form to use at present , but whatever we do have can be used provisionally , as explained in ( d ) ( c ) the "" phonetic distance "" along attested paths of phonetic change of lexical items being compared . there is relatively more of this knowledge available than for phonological change . ( d ) exploring how the three measures above vary as we go to greater time depths . that is , using first the more assured cases , then the less assured ones , how does a weighted average of "" closeness "" of compared lexical items vary as we go to increasing time depths ? how does the proportion of regular and often recurring sound correspondences to unique or rarely recurring sound correspondences vary as we go to increasing time depths ? it is the development of the tools in ( b , c ) which will most advance our abilities to compare at greater time depths , improve our methods . i will be very grateful to anyone who points me to studies which approximate to parts of the program outlined just above . "" the comparative method "" currently does not have the benefit of fully developed tools of this kind . to that degree , the current comparative methods can be considered less rigorous than they ought to be , and for that reason not as powerful at distant language comparisons as they will sometime come to be . a future comparative method can use these tools more and more precisely . the real challenge today to existing comparativists is to avoid artificially fossilizing the term "" the comparative method "" , to avoid treating its methods as fixed and not subject to improvement and supplementing with newer and more powerful methods , as are the methods in any other science . it would be healthy if the word "" the "" were dropped from the term and it were made a mass or plural term "" comparative methods "" . that implies no lessening of rigor . indeed , as i have been at pains to point out above , i firmly believe some of the limitations of the present state of comparative methods result from a * * * lack of rigor * * * in the area of the typology of possible changes ( phonetic , semantic , grammatical ) . work discussed by bill croft in the topic of syntactic reconstruction and typology is certainly relevant to the concerns raised here . i think we are seeing the beginnings of a new paradigm in the focus on paths of change in language , and comparative-historical linguists will be left behind if they do not add these techniques to their box of tools ( while keeping all the good techniques they already have ) . lloyd anderson",Safe Email

Luckily I met this guy Michael at www.blessing-people.com This is a non-profit web site. He really saved me. He started to chant for mine business without asking for any money when I told him my story. In just 10 days my business turn around. At the end of the month I could pay my monthly loan instalment. Thing steadily stabilized. Immediately I subscribe to his chanting servies. Those money Michael collected are for donation later in every year. I know I must have been creating good karma by subscribing to his prayers services. Now I am hunting for my second shop. Thanks to Michael.I do not have any connection to him. I am just spreading this good karma just to repay what he had did for me. I deeply know what ever he did it's a miracle to me. Even until today all I know was Michael chant for me & many people..

line gc data is used as pipeline quality of gas in panhandle lateral because gs report from owens corning delivery point is quite similar to agave gc , 2 ) gas temperatures will become nearly the same as ground temperatures which is provided on scada at p - 1 and p 2 3 ) pressure and temperature profiles on the panhandle lateral at 6 / 14 , 9 : 00 am flowing conditions are listed below the following graph ( attached in ms word ) is a phase envelope using the agave red bluff gas analysis . by mapping the above relative pressure / temperature points it is clearly observed that pipeline pressure and temperature conditions approach and cross the hydrocarbon dewpoint line indicating that liquids would exist . the graph clearly shows that as the pressure and temperatures move further into the envelope the more liquids will be produced . that explains why more liquids are produced by pigging sections between cs p - 2 and cs p - 3 . furthermore , using the process model used to generate the phase envelope , the model indicates that gas at 800 psig and 65 degf would exist in both vapor and liquid phases . using a flow rate of 100 mmcfd the liquid phase fraction would be approximately 80 bbls . per day that could amount to approximately 2400 bbls . per month . this liquid volume compares closely to some of the recovery volumes reported by randy and walt below . lets get together on a conference call to further discuss findings and possible solutions . for a first stab , how about tuesday , 6 / 19 , at 8 : 00 am ( cst ) ? reply with availability and number of ports required . ef 713 / 853 -

arrival time.  If that's what you did, you should go back and break them
into sets randomly instead.  If you did partition them randomly, the wild
variance across runs is mondo mysterious.

collection.  I added code to strip uuencoded sections, and pump out uuencode
summary tokens instead.  I'll check it in.  It didn't make a significant
difference on my usual test run (a single spam in my Set4 is now judged as
ham by the other 4 sets; nothing else changed).  It does shrink the database

"What confuses me is, because these ""scam"" artists are laying out all
the contact information right out on the table, why don't the police
simply pose as recipients of the scam email and trap them?  I mean,
I get no less than a half dozen a day and they should be real easy
to corner.The only answer must be that the authorities in the countries in
question must be in on the scam, but isn't international fraud (and
kidnapping and murder if the reports I've seen on the media are true)
isn't this an Interpol thing?I mean, the perpetrators are not exactly hiding, are they?What I really don't understand is why I keep getting more of these.

"otc gdvi - the momentum continues - gdvi website debute otc bbalert gdvi news update : global diversified industries debutes brand new website ! www . gdvi . net otc bb alert spectacular operating results momentum continues sales projections for next 12 months surpasses $ 20 million 99 . 8 % revenue increase 278 % net income increase 154 % stockholders equity increase 79 % increase in assets $ 8 million order backlog $ 50 million manufacturing capacity overview global diversified industries operates in the modular building construction industry , and strategically targets the california education sector . gdvi is strategically located in central california on 16 acres with a 100 , 000 square foot state - of - the - art manufacturing facility . throughout 2003 and 2004 the company focused on building its infrastructure through acquisitions , development of a state - of - the - art manufacturing facility , and by securing the requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth . through the combination of its new facility ( $ 50 million capacity ) , the increased demand for portable buildings and the state of california ' s bond approvals , gdvi has become well positioned to become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the west coast . gdvi should benefit greatly from the $ 12 . 1 billion school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by california voters next month ( march ) . this presents , in our opinion an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and subsequently invests in those companies . global diversified has taken numerous strategic development steps throughout 2003 and 2004 , including generating strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive growth in 2005 . the company is led by a strong management team with previous success in building companies into $ 50 million per annum businesses . in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue projections , renewed its piggyback contract , received state approvals on engineered product designs , started a new credit facility and opened its new 100 , 000 square foot manufacturing facility . the company will continue to seek new acquisition candidates through its aggressive growth plan . profile gdvi is a holding company that currently operates two wholly owned subsidiaries , mbs construction inc . , a modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work and renovation and global modular , inc . , a sales , marketing and manufacturing of modular type structures . its principal customer base is currently educational ( public and private schools , universities , etc . ) , child - care and municipality sectors . its product lines consist of a variety of portable classroom designs , including both single - story and two - story floor plans . global modular ' s portable classroom structures are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre - approved building plans , commonly referred to as p . c . ' s or pre - checked plans , that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications administered by the california department of state architects ( dsa ) . global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback clause . the state of california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the originating school district . this process saves school districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids . a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may have access to future business for up to five years , depending on the term of the piggyback contract . the strategic focus on california schools since 1998 , california legislation has required that at least 20 % of all new classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures . there are five compelling reasons for this trend : modular classrooms are faster to construct ( as quickly as 2 weeks ) they cost significantly less ( as low as $ 30 , 000 vs . $ 100 , 000 ) they offer greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings they are easier to finance they provide financing incentives to cope with population growth , the state department of education estimates that california will need more than 2 , 500 classrooms each year for the next four years , which equates to more than 10 , 000 classrooms . due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the california education sector , public and private schools are expected to turn to portable / modular construction to fulfill their additional classroom requirements over the next four years . the california schools budget crisis on november 5 , 2002 a $ 13 . 2 billion school facilities improvements bond proposal ( proposition 47 ) was passed by california voters . this bond measure passage does not include an approximate $ 9 . 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school districts throughout the state . a second bond measure worth $ 12 . 1 billion went before the voters on the march 2004 . these bond measures are about three times higher than the record $ 9 . 2 billion bond california voters approved in 1998 . the revenue generated from these bond measures will be used for school modernization programs , which include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular classroom construction and renovations . money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and private schools ; design upgrades and expand building space at community colleges and other institutions of higher learning throughout california . gdvi business infrastructure among global modular ' s asset base is its integrated , state - of - the - art , automated manufacturing process which includes equipment , raw material and marketing collateral that are specifically designed for the high capacity fabrication of modular structures . gdvi employs a workforce of 60 employees and is looking to add to its workforce as demand increases . operates out of a sixteen acre site with a 100 , 000 square foot operating structure . wholly owned subsidiary ( global modular inc . ) markets , designs and manufactures the buildings wholly owned subsidiary ( mbs corporation ) handles installation and building renovation . symbol otc . bb gdvi recent price 13 . 5 cents management team philip hamilton , ceo and president mr . hamilton has an extensive and very successful background in modular manufacturing . from 1996 to feb 2000 he served as chairman and ceo of pacesetter industries inc . he built this company from inception into one of californias largest manufacturers , producing and installing thousands of schools and commercial buildings . under his leadership , pacesetter industries moved into a 5 , 500 , 000 sq . ft . facility in atwater , california with branch sales offices throughout the state . the company employed a staff of over 650 employees and had annual sales of $ 50 , 000 , 000 . adam de bard , vice president mr . de bard has over 6 years of experience in the manufacturing and business sectors . from 1997 to 2000 he served as vice president and chief information officer of pacesetter industries . ronald kilpatrick , director of finance mr . kilpatrick has 36 years experience in both domestic and international development and management of major corporations . he is a managing partner of pacific rim capital llc which provides venture capital to projects in the pacific rim . recent headlines global diversified industries , inc . commencing efforts to increase its u . s . based investor and public relations visibility pr newswire ( tue 5 : 00 am ) global diversified industries , inc . modular division secures new order worth more than $ 3 million for immediate delivery pr newswire ( thu , jun 9 ) wallst . net airing all - new , exclusive audio interviews with gdvi and geoi pr newswire ( tue , jun 7 ) wallst . net airing exclusive audio interviews with gdvi and xle pr newswire ( thu , jun 2 ) global diversified industries , inc . acquires valuable assets from california modular company pr newswire ( thu , may 26 ) global diversified industries , inc . modular division implementing its fourth production line pr newswire ( thu , may 19 ) talkingstocks . com announces interview with philip hamilton , president and ceo of global diversified industries , inc . primezone media network ( tue , may 17 ) stockguru . com initiates profile coverage of global diversified industries , inc . primezone media network ( mon , may 16 ) global diversified industries ' modular division billings total $ 1 . 4 million in april ;

2) While I know that Makefiles generated by a ./configure generated in
turn by a later version of auto* do support the technique you're trying,
I know nothing about what the Perl MakeMaker (or whatever it is)
supports.The general solution for cases like this is to install manually (Try
make -n and see what it does). I think that Perl's installer system
might support an installation root, though I've blissfully no idea how
to operate it.I suggest finding a small Perl module SRPM and looking at the spec file
to see how RedHat (or Turbo, or PLD, although RedHat generally know
*all* the tricks) do it.Dave.

"Hi,This might appear as a very strange email. Maybe it is ;)I'm french, and I'm currently studying in a engineer school in France,
called UTBM (http://www.utbm.fr). Next year, from February to July, I have
to do a practice somewhere in the world (in France or elsewhere).I'm a Linux user and developer since a couple of years now (I coordinate the
KOS project, http://kos.enix.org). That's why I'm looking for a practice in
which I can use Linux and/or develop Linux/BSD Software. I also prefer
working in a small company (< 100 people). But since I've never been to
Ireland (that's why I want to discover this country), and since I have no
contact there, it is very difficult to find companies.So, I thought that the local Linux community maybe was able to help me by
giving some list of companies that are known to work with Linux/BSD or any
other free software.Thank you very much for your helpThomasThomas Petazzoni

"Once upon a time, Mark wrote :> I remember apt-get dist-upgrading from 7.2 to 7.3 fine, so it -should- 
> work, maybe :)I've done that too, on many production servers. The only little
(unimportant) catch is to replace ""kernel-headers"" by ""glibc-kernheaders"",
a simple ""apt-get install glibc-kernheaders"" taking care of that.Upgrading between releases is meant to work, not between betas or beta and
releases. The reason is simple : Some packages may have been downgraded,
some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different
dependencies. For both these categories of packages, the upgrade through
apt/rhn/whatever just won't do, as some older packages might be considered
as the newest, thus being kept on the system.As Red Hat does, I really don't recommend trying to upgrade between betas
or from a beta to a final release either. Simply backup your /home, /etc
(and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'll
probably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-)Matthias--

Just tried smartgroups: The layout of pages is pretty challenging to
use quickly, but the most interesting aspect is that once you are in,
there is no way to get out.  You can unsubscribe yourself as the sole
member of a group, but you cannot delete the group.Or if you can, I couldn't find it before deleting myself, and now it's
invisible to me.  Another interesting thing: Security forms are reset
to full-public settings each time you load them, rather than set from
your current settings.All in all, I wasn't impressed and have stayed with the Yahooligans
for another run.--

"doorpost - post doorstep in my response to brent price on the london doorstep review i alluded to the incompleteness of the list of issues . as i outlined , the key point has been identified , but its knock - on effects are widespread and worrying , especially as they concern the continental power operation : as of today the most recent finalised dpr for this business was for 11 th may , and during the period between then and now we have seen ( although in milder form ) a repeat of the turmoil on the amsterdam power exchange ( apx ) that we witnessed in january this year . this is not the time or the market to not know our position . the business is soon to apply for higher limits to accommodate a new transaction on the polish border . i am bound to comment that based on the state it appears to be in , i would not recommend higher limits . to add insult to injury , as a result of the way this area has been allowed to develop , much of the know - how is in the heads ( and spreadsheets ) of certain key individuals who it seems are now bound rapidly for ebs . uk gas seems to have slipped too . yesterday they reported a $ 7 m loss due to the value of a set of options which were part of a structured deal , booked "" off - system "" and not revalued for over a month . worryingly , there seemed to be more time spent arguing over the nuances of a loss notification memo , than answering some fundamental questions about why it happened . as a corollary , our process of performing "" risk reviews "" has become all the more important in identifying holes in our capture and treatment of market risk in the firm . i expect these to play a big part in our effort to stabilise these areas . dp - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by david port / market risk / corp / enron on 05 / 17 / 2000 10 : 31 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : david port 05 / 17 / 2000 09 : 30 am to : brent a price / hou / ect @ ect cc : mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , steve w young / lon / ect @ ect , tani nath / lon / ect @ ect , mark pickering / lon / ect @ ect , joe gold / lon / ect @ ect , james new / lon / ect @ ect , richard lewis / lon / ect @ ect , michael r brown / lon / ect @ ect , fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect subject : re : project doorstep responsibility matrix thanks for the summary . i was out last week so apologies if my comments arrive too late . here they are anyway : 1 socrates i think it inappropriate for me , or anyone in rac for that matter , to have primary responsibility for this system / project . but if i were responsible the first thing i would want to know is why this project , which commenced in may 1998 , as i recall , is still incomplete , given that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in history , concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart . 2 exhaustive ? it doesn ' t look like an exhaustive list and i suspect it was not intended to be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such . 3 symptoms or causes ? many of the points look like the former , and addressed as they stand will likely leave us with a band - aid solution which will drop off when pressure is applied . in fact many of them look like they are a result of point 5 : "" prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control functionality . . . "" because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten , confirmation errors get made , deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think about changing the way they work . and , for example , when those people move on , as they surely will , the institution has no memory of how to do what they did . i am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on microsoft excel all day , everyday . 4 overall i think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way . rather than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking off , we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operate . as a hypothesis , if most issues stem from point 5 , then i would ask why has prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control functionality ? dp brent a price @ ect 05 / 08 / 2000 11 : 08 am to : mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , steve w young / lon / ect @ ect , tani nath / lon / ect @ ect , mark pickering / lon / ect @ ect , joe gold / lon / ect @ ect , james new / lon / ect @ ect , richard lewis / lon / ect @ ect , michael r brown / lon / ect @ ect , andrew cornfield / lon / ect @ ect , tim davies / lon / ect @ ect , rebecca millerchip / lon / ect @ ect , kevin sweeney / hou / ect @ ect , pablo pissanetzky / lon / ect @ ect , gail hill / lon / ect @ ect , eric virro / lon / ect @ ect , richard sage / lon / ect @ ect , tim poullain - patterson / lon / ect @ ect , ian sloman / lon / ect @ ect , david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron cc : fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect subject : project doorstep responsibility matrix attached is a responsibility matrix for london - project doorstep action steps . the listing consists of controls findings , action steps , proposed timelines , and proposed sponsors and responsibility assignments for the completion of the action steps . the purpose of this matrix will be to review and monitor it on an ongoing basis to ensure that items are being appropriately addressed and completed . please take a moment to review all sections of the listing and communicate any comments or revisions you may have to me as soon as possible . we would like to have a final version of this document in place by may 12 .",Safe Email

Date: 2002-10-07T17:59:05-05:00_Joe Gregorio_: My next pet project[1]. â€œTrying to re-create the ""Good 
Easy[2]"" on a Windows machine.â€ I have also made half-hearted attempts in 
this direction, as I am forced to use Windows during the day. I say 
half-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with 
keyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, 
on any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I 
personally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step 
towards a productive system is managing your Start menu. I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most 
common programs. ""0 Control Panel[3]"", ""1 Mozilla[4]"", ""2 Emacs[5]"", ""3 DOS 
home"", ""4 DOS work"", ""5 DOS incoming"" (each of which gives me a command line, 
but in different directories), ""7 Python[6]"", ""9 IE"". Also ""# Explorer home"", 
""$ Explorer work"", ""% Explorer incoming"", which open Explorer windows in 
various useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only 
with the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went 
to my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus 
(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique 
first letters as needed. ""Ad-aware[7]"", ""Excel[8]"", ""IM"", ""Netscape 4[9]"", 
""Paint Shop Pro"", ""Query Tool (ODBC)[10]"", ""VMWare[11]"", ""Word[12]"". All other 
submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete 
""Accessories"". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a 
larger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like 
WinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean 
Programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. On most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens 
the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your 
fingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a 
new command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for 
compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always 
open, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them 
(mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). I install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a 
collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, 
cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And 
bash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I 
also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 
120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 
3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the 
window. In Mozilla, I set my home page to ""about:blank"", set Internet Search to search 
with Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible 
cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for 
weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the 
background). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open 
unrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, 
delete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes 
me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], 
from which I can find all other bookmarks I need. In Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since 
that's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between 
Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, 
since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and 
pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. I use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is 
so heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named 
foo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which 
is world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this 
sometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which 
is actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files 
in a single directory (d:\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI 
scripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell 
for M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the 
name of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept ""y"" and ""n"" for 
yes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when 
I press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get 
all text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My 
_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. I don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On 
my D drive I have d:\home (contains directories for my books and other personal 
projects, each under CVS controlâ€”also set as my home directory using the 
HOME environment variable), d:\work (contains directories for each work 
project, also under CVS), d:\incoming (set as default download directory for 
all programs that download things), and d:\backup (used by Emacs, and for 
temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly 
created CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. I have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email 
addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal 
information in a text file called phone, stored in d:\home\phone. It is not in 
any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank 
lines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses 
after their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is 
my single most backed-up possession. Other essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI

"workshop on embodied conversational characters call for participation the first workshop on embodied conversational characters with support of aaai cooperation of acm / sigchi granlibakken resort & conference center at lake tahoe tahoe city ( north shore ) california , usa october 12-15 , 1998 recent advances in several core software technologies have made possible a new type of human-computer interface : the conversational character . conversational characters are autonomous , anthropomorphic , animated figures that have the ability to communicate through multiple modalities , including spoken language , facial expressions , and gestures . unlike textual natural language interfaces , conversational characters have the ability to perceive and produce the verbal and non-verbal signals that identify discourse structure and regulate the flow of information between interlocutors . such signals include intonational patterns , gestures , back-channel feedback signals , and turn-taking protocols . these capabilities enable them to engage in complex interactions with human users via natural speech rather than complex command languages , menus or graphical manipulations . research on conversational characters has emerged from a number of disciplines , including , among others , artificial intelligence , computational linguistics , computer animation , computer vision , psychology , cognitive science , virtual reality , cscw , and hci . this diversity is naturally reflected in the broad range of active research areas in conversational character interfaces . the primary goal of this workshop is to advance the state of conversational character research and development by identifying novel approaches to the topics and issues listed below , and integrating them into a framework for embodied , conversational human-computer interaction . a provisional program can be found at http : / / www . fxpal . com / wecc98 / . attendance attendance will be limited to 40 people . there will be space for a few attendees who did not submit papers . non - presenters wishing to attend the workshop should submit a one page description of their current research interests and their relation to the workshop themes . research descriptions should be emailed to prevost @ pal . xerox . com no later than september 14 , 1998 . the list of attendees will be finalized by september 18 . workshop organizers joseph w . sullivan , fx palo alto lab , usa ( sullivan @ pal . xerox . com ) justine cassell , mit media laboratory , usa ( justine @ media . mit . edu ) workshop program committee committee co - chairs : scott prevost , fx palo alto lab , usa ( prevost @ pal . xerox . com ) elizabeth churchill , fx palo alto lab , usa ( churchill @ pal . xerox . com ) committee members : elisabeth andr , dfki gmbh , germany ( elisabeth . andre @ dfki . de ) gene ball , microsoft research , usa ( geneb @ microsoft . com ) phil cohen , oregon graduate institute , usa ( pcohen @ cse . ogi . edu ) barbara hayes - roth , stanford univ . , usa ( hayes-roth @ cs . stanford . edu ) kenji mase , atr international , japan ( mase @ mic . atr . co . jp ) clifford nass , stanford university , usa ( nass @ leland . stanford . edu ) mark steedman , university of pennsylvania , usa ( steedman @ cis . upenn . edu ) kris thorisson , lego a / s , denmark ( kris @ digi . lego . com ) demos chair : timothy bickmore , isii inc . , usa ( bickmore @ pal . xerox . com ) additional information for more information , please consult the workshop web page : www . fxpal . com / wecc98 /",Safe Email

Adam-fantasy.  Women actually are allowed to do things productive,
independent and entirely free of their male counterparts.  They aren't
forced to cook and clean and merely be sexual vessels.   Sometimes,
and this will come as a shock to you, no doubt, men and women even
find -love- (which is the crucial distinction between this system) and
they marry one another for the satisfaction of being together.   I
know, far-fetched and idealistically crazy as it is, but such things
do happen.   I can guarantee you, if my mother was approached by my
father, and 25 years ago, he commented on her cleaning ability as a
motivator for marrying her, we would not be having this conversation
now.If guys still have silly antequated ideas about 'women's role' then
their opportunities for finding women _will_ be scarce.   Again, these
situations are great, provided everyone is aware that the relationship
is a contractual one -- he wants a maid, a dog and a prostitute he
doesn't have to pay, and she wants a country that isn't impoverished
and teeming with AIDS.  A contract, versus a true love-interest
marriage.Egh.  I really need to stop analyzing your posts to this extent.   I

"Marc,The likelyhood of EFF or other mailing lists getting filtered will

"re : 5 . 1448 comparative method the ongoing discussions about the comparative method do not seem to be getting anywhere on achieving real consensus in greenberg and anti - greenberg camps on the question of what would could as valid evidence that certain language families are related at a large time depth . i wonder if it would not be a good idea to hear something - - from the defenders of wide-ranging and large-time - depth comparison , preferably - - concerning what would count as evidence against a genetic relationship ? as a concrete example , take the fact , recently cited by poser , that all the muskogean evidence in greenberg 's book has been found to be tainted by data errors ( geoffrey d . kimball , a critique of muskogean , "" gulf "" , and yukian material in _ language in the americas _ , ijal 58 ( 1992 ) , 447-501 ) . i can imagine how one might want to maintain that even this total collapse of the case on muskogean merely puts us back in a state of being neutral , a priori , on whether muskogean languages are related to other amerindian languages , or to nostratic for that matter . anti - greenberg amerindianists are perfectly prepared to agree that the amerind languages might have descended from a common source now lost . that 's neutrality . but suppose we move from that neutrality to the position that we will assume as a default that muskogean is amerind , and so are all the languages of south america , and indeed , that amerind is related to sino - tibetan and both to indo - european and thus nostratic and all of the above to khoisan . . . let us assume for the sake of argument that the world 's languages are all genetically related ; but let us take this to be an empirical assumption - - not just a willingness to reject the closet racism that poser says ruhlen once alleged in his critics , or a yearning to find universal brotherhood , but an assumption against which evidence can in principle count . now , what sort of linguistic evidence would count , for greenberg and ruhlen and illich - svitych , as disproving the inclusion of muskogean or any other family in in the conjectural ( though tentatively assumed ) proto - gaeic ? that is , what sort of data pattern or configuration of phonological and grammatical properties could suffice to make the macrocomparativists throw in the towel and go outside to meet the press and concede defeat ? there ought to be some imaginable scenario that would end up with ruhlen telling a group of reporters from the stanford daily and american scientist and other supermarket tabloids , "" well , we thought we could sustain the whole proto - gaeic thing , but that set of paradigms on haida has us beat ; we ' ve had to concede the haida case ; according to our tests , haida is unrelated to the other human languages . "" ( much scope for new press attention here : "" haida indians are aliens from space , top expert admits . "" ) but what sort of scenario would it have to be , to get the greenberg camp to admit that it was in grave trouble on some relatedness claim ? to be fair , orthodox comparativists might well say that if you put it like this , no answer should be expected . one can argue that a certain methodology applied to a certain set of data yield no evidence for relatedness between burushaski and bushman , but not that it refutes such a relatedness . a positivist view of historical linguistics would see it as maintaining hypotheses about verifiable relatednesses in a very particular form : when i say that german "" pfennig "" comes from an earlier germanic form with initial "" p "" that will be seen in languages like english with no history of a high german sound shift , i am counted as having been supported by the observation that english speakers say "" penny "" ; if the form turned out to be "" twenny "" i would be in trouble ; given german "" pfund "" i am committed to something like "" pund "" in english , and ( given the great english vowel shift ) the discovery of "" pound "" is more good news for me ; and so on . the predictions i am making are about an indefinitely extensible set of pairs ( ger : pfxxx , eng : pxxx ) . now , the falsity of one of these could conceivably taken to refute brittle forms of the hypothesis that english cognates of german pf-words always begin with p - , but it is n't nearly enough to be counterevidence to the whole english / german relatedness claim , of course . that claim would not be given up unless there was a complete collapse of all the evidence : if "" pound "" was established textually to have been a coinage by a novelist who had never heard german , if "" penny "" was shown to be borrowed from italian "" penne "" during a period when pasta had been used for small change , and then all the other sound correspondences started collapsing as well . i ' m asking this : if the 100 % collapse of greenberg 's muskogean evidence , as alleged by kimball , does not count as a complete collapse of the case that muskogean is included in amerind ( hence , a fortiori , of the case that it is in proto - gaeic ) , then i think i need some help in understanding what could be evidence against that inclusion . there had better be something . + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - + | g e o f f r e y k . p u l l u m * pullum @ cats . ucsc . edu | | stevenson college , university of california , santa cruz , california 95064 | | ( 408 ) 459-4705 * messages ( 408 ) 459-2555 / 2905 * fax ( 408 ) 459-3334 | + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +",Safe Email

The thing is, I hadn't used gconf-editor yet... and it's exactly what I
feared, old ""not so good"" memories are coming back : It looks exactly like
a GNOME RegEdit :-/ Oh well.
I still hope that the few missing features I'm still looking for will be
added in the next 2.0.x releases, like for example being able to have the
panel always under *all* other windows (if you know how to do that, I'm
really interested! ;-)).Cheers,

"re : business offer dear sir , greetings , i am mr . henry okoye the account manager of mr . ziya bazhayev in standard trust bank regional office in victoria island , here in lagos . however i got your contact through the international web directory . i decided to contact you by email because i feel that it is more secured and private . recently we discovered a dormant account with a huge amount of money valued usd 35 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( thirty five million dollars only ) that belongs to one of our late customer who died in a plane crash . during our investigation and auditing in this bank , my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to mr . ziya bazhayev , president of the oil alliance company who died on yak - 40 aircraft , on a charter flight from moscow to kiev on march 9 , 2000 . the fund has been dormant in his account with this bank without any claim of the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery of this development . the banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for six years , it will be forfeited to the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill . it is only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and it is upon this discovery that i decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund . in order to avert this negative development , i on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to our late customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary ? s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased , mr . ziya bazhayev . you will read more news about the plane crash on these websites , http : / / www . amarillonet . com / stories / 031500 / usn _ lao 703 . 001 . shtml and http : / / news . 1 chinastar . com / ll / english / 61934 . shtml in fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants , we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time of transfer since we still work in this bank , this is the actual reason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank a / c immediately to receive this fund , even an empty a / c can also serve for this purpose . on smooth conclusion of this transaction , you will be entitled to 40 % as gratification for your assisting us , and the remaining 60 % will be for me and my partners . what i want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin . i have in my possession , all the necessary documents to successfully accomplish the operation . bear in mind that this proposal is 100 % risk free . further information will be given to you as soon as i receive your positive response . i suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish . find in the attachment of my family picture , to proof who i am . i await your urgent responce . regrads , mr . henry okoye",Phishing Email

extra income from home by either filling out an online questionnaire,
or responding to an email ad, classified ad, postcard, etc.,.
- The other source we use is an Automated Call Center.
We have computerized software that dials up LOCAL residents,
plays a recorded message asking them if they're interested in
making money from home.Â  If they are, the system records their
name and phone number for us to CALL BACK AND QUALIFY.
- The prospects that come from either of the above sources are then
PHONE INTERVIEWED BY US, here in our offices and the following 
info. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):
Name:
Email:
Phone:
Best time to call:
State:
Reason they want to work from home!:
How much they want to make per month:
How much time they can commit per week:
How much money they have available for startup:
If they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:
We'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no
more than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.
- Then the Leads are submitted to a website we set up for you, 
from which the results are then forwarded to you by email.
- This way, you get the Leads fresh, and in *real-time* 
(only minutes old).Â  Never more than 24 hours old.Â  Guaranteed!
- We GUARANTEE that you'll receive AT LEAST a valid Name, 
Phone Number and the Time-Date Stamp corresponding to when
the Lead was generated!Â  However, almost ALL leads will have
ALL of the information asked above.Benefits of our Phone Qualified Lead Generation System:
1. They will be Extremely Qualified due to the nature of the 
qualifying questions that will be asked (above).
2. They are Super-Fresh!Â  Delivered in Real-Time only moments 
after they are contacted and qualified!Â  (Not 30-120 days old)
3. They're Targeted.Â  Each Lead we generate originates from a
targeted list of business opportunity seekers.
4. They're Highly Receptive!Â  Receptivity is very, very high 
because they aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching 
them on opportunities!Â  Also they'll remember speaking to 
someone over the phone.Â  Especially since we tell them to 
expect your call!
5. No ""feast or famine"" activity.Â  Leads will be coming in 
regularly.Â  You dictate the flow!
6. No more cold calls!Â  We tell your prospects you'll be calling.
7. You can *personalize* your approach with the info. you 
get with each Lead!
8. Save Time.Â  Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale.
9. Lower ""burnout"" factor.Â  Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier 
to pick up the phone, day in and day out.
10. You can sort your Leads based on their responses and call the
hottest ones first.
11. You can get new reps started quicker using these Leads due 
to higher closing ratios.Â  Of course, this builds faster and stronger 
momentum, and skyrockets ""new rep retention"" as a result of 
""quick successes"".
12. The Leads will be uniform - almost all leads will have the info. 
indicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)
13. They're double-qualified because to generate the Lead, 
a list of previous business opportunity seekers is used.
14. Excellent control of the flow of Leads coming through.
If you've been trying to run things too long without a steady flow of high
quality leads, call us NOW to get things in motion.Â  Just let us know 
what program you want to advertise and we'll create a customized 
lead-generation campaign for you. 
Since your need to get business moving has probably never been 
more critical than it is today, why not call us NOW!
These are fresh, highly qualified leads because these people aren't 
just responding to some ""Generic Business Opportunity"" ad, they're 
contacted over the phone specifically for YOUR company!Â  And we 
forward you the leads within minutes of the lead being generated - not 
days, weeks, or months!Start Generating As Many SIGN-UPS as You Can Handle!

"fund raising for mit sloan school dear vince , please find the following description of the program that i would like to raise additional funding for . i will follow up today with a phone call to answer any questions you may have . as always we appreciate your time and support . thanks , jozef the eastern european students at mit sloan school of management are preparing an eastern european week to be held in march 2001 . the one - week long program will familiarize our classmates with many of the countries that are going through the post communist transformation . as you well know , eastern europe has a great deal of opportunities for many companies . unfortunately , it also presents many obstacles that make most of the opportunities difficult to capture . because we believe that we can help to eliminate some of these obstacles , we want to bring the eastern european experience to mit sloan school of management . familiarizing the future business leaders with the countries is only one step toward reforming eastern europe , but we believe it is worth our time and effort . during the week , we plan to bring series of lectures addressing the business environment in eastern europe . we want to emphasize especially the success stories from eastern europe . such companies as enron , volkswagen , exxonmobil , gm , and ge have entered the eastern european market and show commitment to stay in it . in at least one panel discussion with academic experts and industry participants we hope to let everyone know that eastern europe is a real place for business . in addition to the educational activities , we are preparing number of cultural events that will introduce the culture of this area . the scope of our program depends greatly on the funds we will be able to raise from our sponsors . in return , we plan to advertise our sponsors in every activity we will do . we will make banners and any other appropriate advertising as desired by the sponsor . should a sponsor be willing to send a speaker for the panel discussion or to give a speech / lecture we would appreciate the enrichment to our program . the advertising will reach nearly 700 sloan students and faculty . in addition , the advertising will reach all newly admitted students , as they will visit our campus for the admit day ( an official program to sell our school to the admitted students ) .",Safe Email

"summary : taps / flaps taps / flaps : summary : not long ago i asked about dialectal variation in english taps ( sometimes called flaps ) for < t > . many thanks to the thirty or so respondents , who i will name only where i cite them . * environments * there was general agreement that the trager description was not ( or , possibly , was no longer ) accurate , although one respondent suggested that his description might fit southern us accents better than northern ones . flapping / tapping of a word-final < t > before a stressed syllable is possible for most of those who responded . some varieties are reported to be leniting the flap further , possibly to zero . various speakers , however , had noted flaps / taps in other people 's dialects which sounded odd to them , eg in words like _ button _ and _ eighteen _ . both of these seem to be ok here ( at least on iambic-reversal 18 ) . the most thorough suggestion came from ian mackay : > an intervocalic t or d is flapped as long as the following syllable ( ie , > the syllable containing the second of the two vowels that the t or d is > "" inter "" ) does not carry primary stress , and that the second vowel does > not carry significantly more stress than the first vowel , and with > the proviso that word boundaries may block the phenomenon ( but do n't > ask me to specify the nature of those word boundaries ! ! ! ) . one ( british ) respondent said that in their dialect , tapping / flapping seemed to be lexically determined , not determined by phonetic environment , so that a flap / tap was possible in _ witty _ but not _ pretty _ , in _ british _ but not in _ skittish _ . and don churma brought in the spectre of morphological conditioning , which might also account for the examples above : > in fact , there are still further details that most folks > seem to be unaware of , like the relevance of "" level 2 "" morpheme > boundaries ( cf . my flapped / t / before the secondarily stressed / i / in > ( deadjectival ) "" elitism "" vs . aspirated / t / in ( denominal ) "" magnetism "" ) . at least all these different aspects of the problem make it clear why it is so hard to describe properly . * syllable - final , syllable-initial or ambisyllabic ? * alice turk reports that her experiments suggest that an ambisyllabic analysis is the most explanatory . this is also reported as the solution used by kahn . other respondents argued for syllable-initial ( on the grounds that for them syllable-final was always glottalised ) or syllable-final ( on the grounds that voiceless taps / flaps also occurred , but only in clear syllable-final position or that clearly syllable-initial / t / s were always aspirated ) . as john harris remarked : > as to the coda-vs - onset issue , i ' m sure you 'd agree , the competition is not > going to be resolved by simply inspecting the data ( or even listening to it ) , > since codas and onsets are not present in them . it 's a matter of comparing > the two theories . i could n't agree more , especially since i am aware of conflicting definitions of ambisyllabicity in the literature on dependency phonology . * references : * harris , john 1990 phonology 7 , harris john & kaye 1990 the linguistic review harris , john 1994 english sound structure ( blackwell ) chapter 4 jensen , john english phonology , kahn , daniel , 1976 syllable - based generalizations in english . dissertation . olive , j . p . , a . greenwoord , & j . coleman . 1993 . acoustics of american english speech . springer - verlag picard , marc ( 1984 ) "" english aspiration and flapping revisited "" . canadian journal of linguistics 29 : 42-57 . turk , a .

Hash: SHA1Ok, time for me to pipe in.  :)Honestly, I find it odd that the spam fighting groups aren't working
and playing well, when the common enemy is the spammers, not each
other.  MAPS and ORBS had a battle for a while, and now DCC seems to
have issues with Razor.  Honestly, work on your own stuff, and let's
fix the spam problem, not pull out rulers.In a spam filter, I'm much, much more concerned about false positives
than false negatives.  Additionally, since spam types are so varied, I
use all available and trustworthy (to me) methods to detect it.  I
tend to want something that has three levels (although nothing like
this exists, yet):        red     is most certainly spam, verified by high ratings from
                several sources, and noone says ""I know this is NOT
                spam.""  I'd probably drop this into a bit-bucket, or
                archive it for humor value.  I expect no
                false-positives to be here.        yellow  This may be spam.  A human should decide (and report).        green   This is probably not spam.spamassassin does something useful here, but it only has the is/isn't
switch, not is/maybe/isn't.  That said, razor is but one check in my
spam fighting arsenal, so if it reports ""doesn't match known spam""
once in a while for well-known spam, something else will probably get
it.- --Michael

"query : latin and romance the following hypothetical question has arisen in connection with what is possibly a real case of the same sort , but in another domain . suppose that latin had only occasionally been written down , and suppose that all latin texts , and indeed all knowledge of latin , had been totally lost long ago , apart perhaps from the odd place name or personal name , now of unknown significance . suppose further that only a single romance language had survived down to the present day - - say , galician , or gascon , or sicilian - - and that this variety had been written down for no more than four centuries and had never acquired any learned words from latin . in fact , to be on the safe side , let 's assume that the entire indo - european family had died out apart from this one romance language . now , suppose that a few fairly substantial latin texts happened to be dug up somewhere , none of them longer than about fifty words , with word-boundaries not systematically marked and the subject matter unknown ; these might have been written down over several centuries , but in no case later than the first century bc . knowing the alphabet , we would be able to read them at the phonological level , at least roughly , but at first the language would be utterly mysterious . so here 's my question . would it be possible for specialists in that last surviving romance language to establish that the recovered texts in fact represented an archaic form of that language , and would they be able to use their knowledge to interpret ( at least in part ) the texts themselves ? if anything turns up , i ' ll summarize the responses and explain what the point of this admittedly curious inquiry is . i ' m sending this query to both the linguist list and the ie list ; my apologies to those who receive it twice . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk",Safe Email

"sum : walloon several weeks ago i posted a passage in the local walloon of the bastogne area of belgium and asked for a translation . i had quite a number of responses , and it appears that the responders had a good time wrestling with the passage . here is the passage : i - gn-e ` a po ^ pre ` s kinze ans du d ' ci , dj ' asto amon albe ^ rt le ` yona ^ rd e ` t dj ' rawa ^ rdo pace k ' on m ' avot dit k ' ou profe ` sseu ^ r do se ' mine ^ re vlot nos ve ` y po pa ^ rler do walon . dju m ' sovin co k ' dj ' e ^ dmande ' a c , ' momint la : < < kin - a ^ dje k ' il e ` , don c , ' cure ' la ? > > dj ' e ^ vite avou compris k ' i n ' astot nin pus cure ' k ' mi , surtout cand dj ' l ' e ^ ve ` you avou oune be ` le djon . ne bwe ^ ce ` le ki n ' compurdot we ^ re lu walon , me ^ s k ' astot bin de ` cide ' a l ' aprinde avou de ` s profe ` sseu ^ rs come pierrot , come jeannot , come roger , ou come mi , di-st - i l ' fou . and here is the consensus translation : il y a a ` peu pre ` s quinze ans d ' ici , j ' e ' tais chez < < albert le ' onard > > et j ' attendais parce qu ' on m ' avait dit qu ' un professeur du se ' minaire voulait nous voir pour parler du wallon . je me souviens ce que j ' ai demande ' a ` ce moment-la ` : < < quel a ^ ge a-t - il donc , ce cure ' - la ` ? > > j ' avais vite compris qu ' il n ' e ' tais pas plus cure ' que moi , surtout quand je l ' ai vu avec une belle jeune demoiselle qui ne comprenait gue ` re le wallon , mais qui e ' tait bien de ' cide ' e a ` l ' apprendre avec des professeurs comme pierrot , comme jeannot , comme roger , ou comme moi , dit-il , le fou . there were some uncertainties and disagreements ; i ' ve gone with the majority view in each case . the biggest problem was the very last bit , which caused havoc , though the gist of it seems generally clear . there was some disagreement as to whether it was the non-priest or the young girl who wanted to learn walloon ; most people went for the woman , which is what the syntax appears to say . the strange form < rawa ^ rdo > in the second line appears to be the same word as french < regarder > , but i am told that , in northern dialects , this word is widely used in the sense of ` wait , wait for , watch for ' . another headache was the word < bwe ^ ce ` le > in line 6 . this clearly means something like < demoiselle > , and it is possibly the same word as french < pucelle > ` virgin , maiden ' , which is unlikely to be the sense intended . i am told that speakers of walloon are now generally elderly , apart from some younger people who are enthusiasts ( though the belgian student i consulted here told me she had a friend who spoke walloon ) . some younger people of limited education are also said to have a grasp of the variety , and , engagingly , i am told that obscenities and insults tend to persist especially well . one respondent objected to my speaking of walloon as a dialect of french , preferring to see it as a distinct language . here 's an english version : it 's fifteen years ago now ; i was at the "" albert leonard "" [ institute ] and i was curious because i had been told that a teacher from the seminary wanted to see us to talk about walloon . i still remember what i was wondering at that moment : "" so how old is that priest ? "" i quickly understood that he was no more a priest than i was , particularly when i saw him with a beautiful young girl who scarcely knew any walloon but who was determined to learn it from teachers like pierrot , like jannot , like roger , or like me ; that 's what he said , the fool . the passage was written by m . georges pasau , pre 's ident du muse ' e de la parole au pays de bastogne ; it appeared in issue 4 ( 1994 ) of the magazine _ singuliers _ , which is devoted to walloon . this was a special number given over to the publication of a new dictionary of walloon . the dictionary is michel francard ( 1994 ) , _ dictionnaire des parlers wallons du pays de bastogne _ , brussels : deboeck / universite ' , isbn 2-8041 - 1957 - 2 . francard is professor of romance linguistics at the university of louvain in belgium ; his address is faculte ' des lettres , universite ' catholique de louvain , louvain - le - nauve , belgium , and his e-mail is francard @ frwa . ucl . ac . be . i have n't consulted him yet , but plan to do so . the orthography used here for walloon was , i believe , invented by francard specifically for the dictionary . the dictionary contains some nice dialect maps and some linguistic information about walloon . my thanks to jean - francois carrasco , richard coates , jean - francois delannoy , roger feron , frederik fouvry , vincent granville , ted harding , yolande meessen , philippe mennecier , bernd moebius ( and his mother ! ) , joseph reisdoerfer , thierry j . van steenberghe , guido vanden wyngaerd , and max wheeler . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk",Safe Email

"erd review here ' s a summary of our conversation so you have points to follow up with . general status of the database model : fix not represented - need to incorporate into common design and standardize - might cause some fix rework . referential integrity not entirely enforced - potential for bad data to develop . snapshots from global databases are currently daily - this can be easily changed to be more frequent , but need to consider implementation as decision on direction of global as a part of commodity logic is made . rate information not developed - need integration with rate server or mkm , preferably mkm . need to define how mkm will be used - whether just for index names or to obtain actual settlement prices or curves as well . application development is not currently occurring on a single version of the database . therefore , some issues could arise as each development team migrates to the standard . this needs to happen relatively quickly . specific issues : gfd _ pipe _ meters _ snp - probably need to add fac _ type ( wh , ite , etc ) for possible use as validation in kx functionality gas _ deal _ location _ dtl - this table refers to facility number rather than pipe and meter . facility number is an enronism that no other company will recognize . pipe and meter general - should try to avoid using pipe _ cd as key . this value needs to be updateable as pipelines are bought and sold . - data for facilities is heavily dependent upon enron global facilities database in current design and functionality - this needs revisiting as the decision surrounding global is made cp _ addr _ vw - this table references only internal _ cp _ id and contact _ type _ cd in conjunction with address _ id . addresses are specific to internal _ cp _ id , product _ cd , deal _ nature _ cd , contact _ type _ cd , and region _ cd . need to add deal nature , product , and region to ensure correct address usage since many companies align their business along these determinants and addresses may vary counterparty - there is a mixture of the usage of global counterparty . some areas indicate a certain amount of independence from enron ' s global counterparty system , by having a table to capture commodity logic information on a counterparty such as phone numbers , credit ratings , etc . this would position cl to become independent at a later date . yet , commodity logic functions as a subset of enron networks and gcp must make entries to indicate the usage of a customer by enron networks to obtain an sap id and support payment processing through to sap . so , cl could not become independent without further functionality or process changes . so why not put the added data requirements within gcp to start with ? if global moves to commodity logic , then this design needs to be revisited for sure . there should probably be some standardization between dependence / independence whether or not cl separates from enron . common data - status is not included in the views being utilized by the applications . i hope the views have been filtered for active status only . show was going to check on this . - concept of mapping others ' codes to ours for processing , is not supported anywhere in these tables . perhaps that has been handled in an isolated manner in the fix design ? this will have to be there for internal release as well as external release . this is critical to the hub concept . i look forward to sitting in on your meetings surrounding these issues . let me know if you have further questions .",Safe Email

( 713 230 3000 general line ) . kim nelson - she is a manager in the risk group at aa , and just transferred over from kpmg . i have not met her , but i did hear that she is not doing what she had expected at aa . i don ' t know her number but you could reach her at the general aa line . kevin schroder - audit manager at kpmg in the energy department . i do not know him , but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the audit / consulting area ( general line 713 319 2000 ) . keith considine - he is currently a senior accountant at pwc . he is the best senior pwc houston has , as well as probably one of the best people i have ever worked with ( the top of his class ) . although he only has 4 years of work experience ( all at pwc ) , he performs in a manager capacity . he worked for me on the coral energy audit engagement and received an excellent evaluation from both myself and the partners ( we all agreed that he is one of the best people any of us have seen or worked with ) . he is currently working on a project at one of pwc ' s clients to standardize their mid office processes . he definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of pwc , but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to manager . i actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at july 1 this year , but due to capacity issues , i don ' t expect that the promotion will be approved . since i ' ve only been with enron a short time and would like to continue good relations with pwc , i would appreciate whoever contacts keith to elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name . his number is 713 356 5617 . dave simpson - analyst at koch energy in houston , has a degree in accounting and has work experience of about 9 months . he is very interested in leaving koch . i know him on a person basis , but have not worked with him . he is a good guy and very likeable . i don ' t have his phone number , but should be reachable through the general number for koch . admin assistants connie shugart - she is currently working at pwc as an administrative assistant . she is also involved in recruiting experienced personnel for pwc ' s audit and internal audit service lines . she is very interested in enron and has asked me a few times to get her a contact here . i have not worked directly with her but due to her close proximity to my office i talked to her a number of times and was very impressed .

"[ ilug - social ] re : take the steps to wealth for $ 25 . do it now 26138654332222 updated may 9 , 2002 . . . read this ! you ' ll be happy you did ! a recent survey by nielsen / netratings says that "" the internet population is rapidly approaching a ' half a billion ' people ! "" so what does all this mean to you ? let ' s assume that every person has ' only ' one e - mail address . that ' s 500 million potential customers and growing ! in addition , "" e - mail is without question the most powerful method of distributing information on earth "" well , i think you get the picture . the numbers and potential are just staggering , but it gets even better . . . start your own e - mail business today & enjoy the following benefits : 1 . all customers pay you in cash 2 . you will sell a product which costs nothing to produce 3 . your only major overhead is your time 4 . you have 100 s of millions of potential customers 5 . you get detailed , easy to follow startup instructions and this is just the tip of the iceberg . . . as you read on you ' ll discover how a ' seen on national tv ' program is paying out excellent returns , every 4 to 5 months from your home , for a minimal initial startup investment of only $ 25 us dollars . all thanks to the computer age and the internet ! this is the letter you have been hearing a lot about recently . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . this is what one had to say : ' ' thanks to this profitable opportunity . i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it . i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received a 6 figure income in 21 weeks , with money still coming in ' ' . pam hedland , fort lee , new jersey . here is another testimonial : ' ' this program has been around for a long time but i never believed in it . but one day when i received this again in the mail i decided to gamble my $ 25 on it . i followed the simple instructions and walaa . . . . . 3 weeks later the money started to come in . first month i only made a small amount of money , but the next 2 months after that i made a total of a good 6 figures . so far , in the past 8 months by re - entering the program , i have made a lot more and i am playing it again . the key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change anything . ' ' more testimonials later but first : * * * * * print this now for your future reference & follow these simple instructions to make your financial dreams true ! * * * * * instructions : = = = = = = = = = = = = * * * * order all 5 reports shown on the list below . * * * * for each report , send $ 5 u . s . cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering and your e - mail address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems . * * * * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the 5 reports * * * * you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . your up - front cost is only $ 5 x 5 = $ 25 . 00 . * * * * * * * * * within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who may order from you . also make a floppy of these reports and keep it at your desk in case something happens to your computer . * * * * * * * * * * important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will loose out on majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter , it will not work ! people have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money . but it does not work this way . believe us , we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened . so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed . because if you do , it will not work for you . remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! ! 1 . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this advertisement and remove the name & address of the person in report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their money . 2 . move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5 . 3 . move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4 . 4 . move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3 . 5 . move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2 . 6 . insert your name & address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name & address accurately ! take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do not make any other changes . save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information that includes : how to send bulk e - mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much , much more . there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going : method # 1 : sending bulk e - mail legally = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receive only a 0 . 2 % response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0 . 2 % . also , many people may send out hundreds of thousands e - mails instead of only 5 , 000 each ) . continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that ' s = 100 people responded and ordered report # 2 . those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 . those 1000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 5 million e - mails sent out . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) emails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 . that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( a half million ) . your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . . . . . . grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00 numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you can still make money ! remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 people you mailed . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or 1 / 2 , or even one 1 / 5 of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 500 million people on the internet worldwide and counting . believe me , many people may do just that , and more ! method # 2 : placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet can easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the emails they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . order each report by its number & name only . note : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks or money orders are not accepted . make sure the cash is wrapped in at least 2 sheets of paper before you put it in the envelope . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number and the name of the report you are ordering , your email address , your name and postal address . make sure you affix proper ' international ' postage if ordering a report from outside your country . place your order for these reports now : report 1 : the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net . . . order from : p . hynes 6461 mayfield rd brampton , on canada l 6 t 3 z 8 report 2 : the insiders guide to sending bulk e - mail on the net . . . order from : lynn asbill 9400 bluebonnet dr scurry , tx 75158 usa report 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net . . . order from : greg grant po box 385 wilberforce , on canada kol 3 co report 4 : how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net . . . order from : lw 50 burnhamthorpe rd w suite 401 mississauga , on canada l 5 b 3 c 2 report 5 : how to send out one million emails & jump start your business . . . order from : bdm consulting po box 890 orem , ut 84059 usa there are currently almost 500 , 000 , 000 people online worldwide ! $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do . after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another batch of e - mails and start the whole process again ! ! ! following is a note from the originator of this program : follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 . . . . . . . . . . . # 5 as instructed above . one of the people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on every one of them . remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity . . . . it is up to you now !

"access on the block : international transmission auctions - cera a lert - december 20 , 2000 title : access on the block : international transmission auctions are opening european power markets e - mail category : cera insight cera knowledge area : european power despite an apparent impasse in negotiations among european transmission system operators , regulators , and the european commission in florence , auctions of international transmission capacity ( itc ) in france , the united kingdom , denmark , belgium , italy , austria , switzerland , slovenia , and the netherlands are opening access between countries and paving the way for the single european marketplace . however , the patchwork auctioning of access to itc leaves important issues unresolved . the most significant of these include the potential for gaming , third - party transit , and the allocation of auction proceeds . as they stand , these issues , cera believes , are likely to lead to action at the european level and the eventual imposition of a more integrated scheme . nevertheless , current plans to open most of europe ' s itc represent a watershed of activity that will hasten transparency in the market and determine trade flows and signal transmission investment in 2001 . international auctions are opening markets a major portion of international transmission capacity on the continent will be allocated by auction in 2001 ( see table 1 ) . in cera ' s view auctions for itc are likely to have the greatest impact during 2001 in the following areas : * increasing market transparency . the posting of available transmission capacity on yearly , monthly , and daily bases will facilitate the market ' s efficient usage of scarce interconnector capacity . for the first time , signals for new transmission investment , power flows , and transmission asset valuation will come from the market . * increasing cross - border trade . although auctions may not reduce uncertainty in the marketplace initially , the effect of heightened transparency in access rules and prices will soon work to increase trade . secondary markets for interconnector capacity will add to the number of actively traded power products and work to increase the overall level of trade . ? * increasing price correlation . auctions will replace nonmarket - based allocation methods such as long - term capacity reservation . the dynamic character of shorter - term auctions , combined with an expected secondary market for capacity , should bring access to international capacity in line with the needs of the market . in this way the market will be able to adjust more rapidly to changes in local conditions and thereby work to correlate pricing points . * increasing competition . once players have secured access to itc at a given price , they will be looking to sign supply contracts or integrate the capacity into structured deals . the result could be more aggressive maneuvering on the part of incumbents and new entrants alike , resulting in greater competition at the national level . * reducing the competitiveness of imports . the results of international transmission capacity auctions will determine the competitiveness of imported power into domestic markets . final prices offered for itc will reflect the relative cost of power between markets and work to make cheaper power more expensive to import . * spurring investment in transmission . the money raised through auction could provide transmission companies with the financial capability to invest in upgrading international transmission links . access to international transmission capacity between the netherlands , germany , and belgium in 2001 was auctioned for 63 million euros ( see http : / / www . tso - auction . org for details ) . ? auctions for access into spain , france , and italy are expected to realize a premium for access to highly coveted markets . connecting rather than integrating markets auctions between national grids , or more accurately commercial grids , are a pragmatic approach to the problem of granting access to scarce international transmission capacity on an open and transparent basis . the auctions will open access to interconnectors and at the same time reward transmission system operators . even so , the proposed approaches are not likely to satisfy market players or the stated objectives of european policymakers . in cera ' s view the following issues may eventually bring down the hammer on itc auctions : * third - party transit . the bilateral nature of itc auctions perpetrates the problem of tariff pancaking and discriminates against trade involving transit through a third grid . this is ultimately inconsistent with the european commission ' s objective of a single european power market . the fact that physical power flows do not follow contractual flows and almost always transit third - party grids further weakens the legitimacy of the approach . * transaction - based scheme . although still transactional in nature ( tied to a specific deal ) , auctions fall within the european commission ' s stated preference for market - based mechanisms for allocating international transmission capacity . it remains to be seen how successful this approach is in achieving integration of national markets . action at the european level could move allocation of itc in the direction of nontransactional mechanisms such as market splitting , counter trading , or redispatching . * gaming of auctions . auctions will in theory allocate access to transmission on a nondiscriminatory market basis to those that value it most . in practice it remains to be seen if gaming can be avoided . even though most of the auctions have placed limits on ownership of transmission capacity , tactical maneuvers could bid up transmission prices as players act to raise the price of imported power . * allocating auction proceeds . one likely outcome of auctions will be the transfer of profits between players as transmission owners recoup some of the rents currently reaped by other players . this will works to raise the value of transmission assets relative to generation , suppliers , or traders . it remains to be seen how funds from auctions will be allocated among transmission companies and the grid , as transmission is still currently subject to monopoly regulation . * * end * * come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 , 2001 ! ?

I'm not sure what you mean by ""let's you and him fight"", but it is 
important to remember that England was in control of Ireland
for 300 years, and that it was only thanks to the distraction of WW I 
that the south managed to gain its independence. If you mean
splitting countries upon arbitrary lines and assigning different groups 
to opposite sides of the line, it also seems to have not worked in
India/Pakistan.
I suppose Canada, which is supposed to be a ""loose confederation"" of 2 
founding nations (French and English) can be cited as a success. The 
jury is still out, but so far only a few brief rebellions and 
referendums and such, still together after 130+ years.Owen",Safe Email

FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX
IKOYI-LAGOS.ATTN:,                  First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of itÂ’s nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.
(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.
(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me.

Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. 
Register for Gnomedex today!   This year's SIC gets the blame for the 
lateness of this issue. Lori and I spent Wednesday thru Sunday meeting 
software authors, participating in educational sessions, viewing product 
demonstrations, and most of all having fun. This was Lori's second trip 
to an SIC conference, so she got to reacquaint herself with many familiar 
faces, while I was getting to put faces with many people I've exchanged 
e-mails with over the last several years. As much as I enjoy information 
exchange via computer, the human interaction of meeting people and 
sharing ideas and stories face-to-face is priceless.One cool discovery at this year's SIC, pertaining directly to Webmasters, 
is Nick Bradbury's release of 
TopStyle 3.0. 
Nick's the guy who created HomeSite, long before it joined the Macromedia 
family of products. Version 3 represents a return to those HTML editing 
roots, with the addition of editing capabilities now functioning 
hand-in-hand with the rock solid style sheet building features that 
previously defined  TopStyle. Conversion of existing font tags to CSS is 
just one of several new additions. I should have a full review in one of 
the next two issues.Also in the coming soon category - a GnomeTome on Cold Fusion, written by 
one of Iowa's resident ColdFusion experts (who also happens to be an 
expert on an International level), Kevin Schmidt. Kevin wrote the 
Training From the Source 
book on Cold Fusion 5 and is currently writing a revision for 
ColdFusionMX. The GnomeTome means we'll have a nice pairing of tips for 
both static pages, in the form of 
Dreamweaver tips, and tips on dynamic 
site development with Kevin's tips on ColdFusion.Jake LudingtonÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeMAIL

experienced administrators who tire of scrolling through screen after 
screen of configurations. A source view makes manual editing of the 
file easier, by bolding and coloring various configuration directives, 
similar to the way HTML editors mark code. Avoid typos with built-in 
error checking, which provides warnings when invalid directives are 
used.

Making A Commercial Case for Adopting Web Standards
http://www.maccaws.com/Supporting standards and writing good code are often things that the number 
crunchers in a business don't feel are as important, when compared against 
getting the product to as many people as possible in the shortest amount of 
time possible in an effort to generate revenue. Communicating the 
importance of standards and good code can be an uphill battle; after all, 
you're just a programmer, right? MACCAWS aims to make your job easier, via 
an open discussion on the establishment of standards that will make sense 
to the folks who control the bottom line. Their mission is to educate 
business leaders by providing you the end user with tools that will help 
make a case for applying standards to your Web efforts. If you've got a 
voice you'd like to add to their cause, visit them on the Web and help

"I *like* corn..-------- Original Message -------- Subject: [interest] FWD: When a Crop Becomes King Date: Fri, 19 Jul 2002 10:14:23 -0400 (EDT) From: Donald Eastlake 3rd July 19, 2002 When a Crop Becomes King By MICHAEL POLLANCORNWALL BRIDGE, Conn. -- Here in southern New England the corn is already waist high and growing so avidly you can almost hear the creak of stalk and leaf as the plants stretch toward the sun. The ears of sweet corn are just starting to show up on local farm stands, inaugurating one of the ceremonies of an American summer. These days the nation's nearly 80 million-acre field of corn rolls across the countryside like a second great lawn, but this wholesome, all-American image obscures a decidedly more dubious reality.Like the tulip, the apple and the potato, zea mays (the botanical name for both sweet and feed corn) has evolved with humans over the past 10,000 years or so in the great dance of species we call domestication. The plant gratifies human needs, in exchange for which humans expand the plant's habitat, moving its genes all over the world and remaking the land (clearing trees, plowing the ground, protecting it from its enemies) so it might thrive.Corn, by making itself tasty and nutritious, got itself noticed by Christopher Columbus, who helped expand its range from the New World to Europe and beyond. Today corn is the world's most widely planted cereal crop. But nowhere have humans done quite as much to advance the interests of this plant as in North America, where zea mays has insinuated itself into our landscape, our food system and our federal budget.One need look no further than the $190 billion farm bill President Bush signed last month to wonder whose interests are really being served here. Under the 10-year program, taxpayers will pay farmers $4 billion a year to grow ever more corn, this despite the fact that we struggle to get rid of the surplus the plant already produces. The average bushel of corn (56 pounds) sells for about $2 today; it costs farmers more than $3 to grow it. But rather than design a program that would encourage farmers to plant less corn which would have the benefit of lifting the price farmers receive for it Congress has decided instead to subsidize corn by the bushel, thereby insuring that zea mays dominion over its 125,000-square mile American habitat will go unchallenged.At first blush this subsidy might look like a handout for farmers, but really it's a form of welfare for the plant itself -- and for all those economic interests that profit from its overproduction: the processors, factory farms, and the soft drink and snack makers that rely on cheap corn. For zea mays has triumphed by making itself indispensable not to farmers (whom it is swiftly and surely bankrupting) but to the Archer Daniels Midlands, Tysons and Coca-Colas of the world.Our entire food supply has undergone a process of ""cornification"" in recent years, without our even noticing it. That's because, unlike in Mexico, where a corn-based diet has been the norm for centuries, in the United States most of the corn we consume is invisible, having been heavily processed or passed through food animals before it reaches us. Most of the animals we eat (chickens, pigs and cows) today subsist on a diet of corn, regardless of whether it is good for them. In the case of beef cattle, which evolved to eat grass, a corn diet wreaks havoc on their digestive system, making it necessary to feed them antibiotics to stave off illness and infection. Even farm-raised salmon are being bred to tolerate corn not a food their evolution has prepared them for. Why feed fish corn? Because it's the cheapest thing you can feed any animal, thanks to federal subsidies. But even with more than half of the 10 billion bushels of corn produced annually being fed to animals, there is plenty left over. So companies like A.D.M., Cargill and ConAgra have figured ingenious new ways to dispose of it, turning it into everything from ethanol to Vitamin C and biodegradable plastics.By far the best strategy for keeping zea mays in business has been the development of high-fructose corn syrup, which has all but pushed sugar aside. Since the 1980's, most soft drink manufacturers have switched from sugar to corn sweeteners, as have most snack makers. Nearly 10 percent of the calories Americans consume now come from corn sweeteners; the figure is 20 percent for many children. Add to that all the corn-based animal protein (corn-fed beef, chicken and pork) and the corn qua corn (chips, muffins, sweet corn) and you have a plant that has become one of nature's greatest success stories, by turning us (along with several other equally unwitting species) into an expanding race of corn eaters.So why begrudge corn its phenomenal success? Isn't this the way domestication is supposed to work?The problem in corn's case is that we're sacrificing the health of both our bodies and the environment by growing and eating so much of it. Though we're only beginning to understand what our cornified food system is doing to our health, there's cause for concern. It's probably no coincidence that the wholesale switch to corn sweeteners in the 1980's marks the beginning of the epidemic of obesity and Type 2 diabetes in this country. Sweetness became so cheap that soft drink makers, rather than lower their prices, super-sized their serving portions and marketing budgets. Thousands of new sweetened snack foods hit the market, and the amount of fructose in our diets soared.This would be bad enough for the American waistline, but there's also preliminary research suggesting that high-fructose corn syrup is metabolized differently than other sugars, making it potentially more harmful. A recent study at the University of Minnesota found that a diet high in fructose (as compared to glucose) elevates triglyceride levels in men shortly after eating, a phenomenon that has been linked to an increased risk of obesity and heart disease. Little is known about the health effects of eating animals that have themselves eaten so much corn, but in the case of cattle, researchers have found that corn-fed beef is higher in saturated fats than grass-fed beef.We know a lot more about what 80 million acres of corn is doing to the health of our environment: serious and lasting damage. Modern corn hybrids are the greediest of plants, demanding more nitrogen fertilizer than any other crop. Corn requires more pesticide than any other food crop. Runoff from these chemicals finds its way into the groundwater and, in the Midwestern corn belt, into the Mississippi River, which carries it to the Gulf of Mexico, where it has already killed off marine life in a 12,000 square mile area.To produce the chemicals we apply to our cornfields takes vast amounts of oil and natural gas. (Nitrogen fertilizer is made from natural gas, pesticides from oil.) America's corn crop might look like a sustainable, solar-powered system for producing food, but it is actually a huge, inefficient, polluting machine that guzzles fossil fuel -- a half a gallon of it for every bushel.So it seems corn has indeed become king. We have given it more of our land than any other plant, an area more than twice the size of New York State. To keep it well fed and safe from predators we douse it with chemicals that poison our water and deepen our dependence on foreign oil. And then in order to dispose of all the corn this cracked system has produced, we eat it as fast as we can in as many ways as we can turning the fat of the land into, well, fat. One has to wonder whether corn hasn't at last succeeded in domesticating us. ====== Michael Pollan is the author, most recently, of ""The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World."" http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",Safe Email

Browse the full gallery!   Somehow, it never got mentioned that Lockergnome has a GnomeTome for all 
you 
Dreamweaver users out there. Dennis Jarrett, a gnomie from the UK 
with a prolific list of writing accomplishments, lent his brain to a list 
of things everyone should know to make using Dreamweaver 4 (and newer) 
easier to use. I 've never actually used version 4, having stuck with 3 
until recently starting the review process of the StudioMX  suite, but 
I've been  able to apply every tip I tried to some aspect of DreamweaverMX, 
so I can only guess those of you using 4 will want to 
check 'em out too.As I mentioned in yesterday's Digital Media newsletter, I recently 
switched cell phones to the 
Kyocera QCP6035. 
The unit is Palm powered, with a screen the size of an m105 and all the 
functionality of Palm OS, in addition to having the latest bells and whistles 
you'd want in a phone. Built in Web browsing, by way of MSN, is slightly 
cumbersome compared to what I'm used to from my cable connection, but I can 
already see the usefulness in carrying around portable access to things like 
driving directions. Now that I've got a way to test the final results in real time, I've got a 
more vested interest in making Lockergnome considerably more WAP compatible. 
I'm still figuring out many of the phone's features, so that's still going to 
be at least  a few weeks away. Without a doubt, I'll be sharing my experiences 
in WAPing Lockergnome in an upcoming series of articles.Jake LudingtonÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeMAIL
phpMyNewsletter
http://gregory.kokanosky.free.fr/phpmynewsletter/As a free solution for managing newsletters, for smaller lists, 
this does most of what you need. Subscribers are stored in a 
mySQL database, with the ability to send user confirmation 
e-mails. Initially, the address must still be added manually to 
the database, which isn't idea, but doing this generates a 
confirmation e-mail with a link that users click on if they want 
to be added. The software purges addresses with no response, 
following an administrator defined waiting period. From the php 
interface you can send either text or HTML formatted messages, 
with a built-in preview to make sure your formatting is OK. 
Documentation is somewhat sparse, so prior knowledge of php and 
mySQL are useful in getting this installed.Â GnomeTOOLSOpalisRobot v4.0 [60MB] NT/W2k/XP
http://www.opalis.comThink of this as something like ""cron for Windows"" only even more powerful. 
OpalisRobot allows you to schedule almost any process on your server, 
adding an additional layer of functionality, like the ability to program 
telephony commands to complete administrative tasks. OpalisRobot 
effectively processes e-mail commands, in addition to telephone DTMF tones, 
making everything on your server administerable from remote locations, 
even when you can't get remote control access of the machine. Programming 
jobs is point-click simple, saving you time even when you schedule tasks 
to save you time. If you operate in a Windows server environment, you're 
adding extra hours to your day and costing your company additional dollars 
by not having this software.Â GnomeSERVER

Â GnomeUSABILITYhttp://diveintomark.org/Not only is this information great for improving blog accessibility, it 
happens to be equally relevant for *any* site. The 30 days are nearing 
their end, which means you won't have to wait to find out what's next; 
you can simply click to the next page. Mark Pilgrim, the site's creator, 
sets the stage with 5 characters (all of which could easily represent 
real people) and walks through their physical, mental, and technological 
limitations. Following the character introductions, Mark walks through 
an accessibility scenario each day and then relates the concept back 
specific benefits for each character's limitations. Solutions are 
presented with blogs in mind, but with very little extrapolation you'll 
be able to make every site you design more user friendly.

Backend.UserLand.Com
http://backend.userland.com/I've been using Radio from the moment I finally got around to creating 
a blog. The software keeps things simple and automatically updates 
itself when new things get added. Userland goes far beyond creating a 
desktop interface for their blogging system though. They've fully 
documented all the XML, XML-RPC, and SOAP tie-ins used to connect to 
their network, which could easily be adapted to other content 
management applications with some XML knowhow. Backend is the place to 
look ""under the hood"" at Userland's XML inner workings, including 
detailed documentation on making everything work. If you've got 
modifications or improvements to the system, they have an open 
discussion forum for trading ideas.

remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands more coming online every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report . = = = = = = = = = = = available reports = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the reason for the "" cash "" is not because this is illegal or somehow "" wrong "" . it is simply about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you . order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 : "" the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net "" order report # 1 from : robert borowczyk ul . j . olbrachta 118 c m . 28 01 - 373 warsaw poland report # 2 : "" the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net "" order report # 2 from : mohammad faraziyan engelbertstr . 25 40233 düsseldorf germany report # 3 : "" secret to multilevel marketing on the net "" order report # 3 from : luis pastor apartado 81 48080 bilbao spain report # 4 : "" how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net "" order report # 4 from : ali reza auf den holln 68 44894 bochum germany report # 5 : "" how to send out one million emails for free "" order report # 5 from : j . siden krondikesvägen 54 a 83147 östersund sweden $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : = = = if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do . = = = after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you do not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in !

There are many more whoe only have one partner over ""long""
periods of time. So it is far from ""vacuous"" to describe some
people as ""promiscuous"" and others as ""not promiscuous"", 
especially over a set period. (""He was promiscuous in college.
He is no longer promiscuous."")The word has a clear meaning, despite your continuing tendency 
to gloss that meaning over with population averages. > >Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females.

pair off with 500,000 women. Then, 1 man, let's call him ""Wilt"",
also has sex with the other 499,999 women. 499,999 women have had more than one partner. 499,999 men have
only had one partner. It is now ""perfectly obvious"" that in the
common meaning of the term, among this contrived population, 
that women are ""more promiscuous"" than men -- even though the
single ""most promiscuous"" person, Wilt, is a man.  ""Promiscuity"" is not ""exactly, perfectly identical between males 
and females"", except under a degenerate custom definition of

"comparative method just as morris halle once pointed out that any phonological system could be analyzed as having two phonemes , so too it seems clear that any two languages , related or not , could have a reconstruction done for them , involving both a set of correspondences among the words or morphemes and a comparative grammar . and just as in fact a phonology with only two phonemes would be just a formal excersise and not a real phonology , so too the "" reconstruction "" i am referring to would have no validity unless the languages really are related ( or in the case of mixed languages , unless the relevant parts were related ) . but the formal possibility is important to the following extent : it shows that we cannot assume that the ability to write a comparative grammar is either necessary or sufficient for showing that the languages in question are related . it is the ability to write a convincing comparative gramm ` r that is significant here , but by the same token language relatedness can be sjown by establishing a convincing set of correspodences between suitable sets of words or morphemes of the languages being compared . i will even conceded that it is harder , in general , to be convincing in the case of a comparative grammar than it is in the case of a set of correspondences ( since the former would seem to include the latter plus a lot more ) . but what no one has yet shown here or anywhere else is that the only way to establish language relatedness is by writing a complete comparative grammar , and even meillet conceded by 1925 that you cannot even demand a fragment of a grammar because there are perfectly well-established families where this either has not been or indeed cannot be done . it is another matter 9and ultimately a more interesting one ) that significant amount of grammatical comparison ( though not a whole grammar ) has been offered for nostratic ( a theory i find likely though perhaps not yet established ) as well as for amerind ( a theory which i find basically as unsupported as do karl and victor , for example ) . and it is perhaps not uninteresting that illich - svitych proposed to write a nostratic comparative grammar but never did , much as sapirpromised to write one for uto - aztecan but failed to ( though we should in all fairness note that sapir lived for another two decades , whereas illich - svitych died without even finishing the lexical and morphemic comparisons which are the bulk of the evidence that we have in the public domain for nostratic ) . this is no criticism of sapir , of course , if we agree that there was no need to write a comparatve grammar of uto - aztecan in order for everybody to be able to see that the uto - aztecan languages are related . just as there is no need for this in the case of nostratic 9and indeed given the age of proto - nostratic , if there was such a language , it seems unlkikely that we will ever have more than a very partial grammar",Safe Email

( 2 ) why are such people as the gardners , savage - rumbaugh , chadwick , etc . so irritated at us ? on the first question , all of my respondents , as well as david pesetsky , seem to be agreed that the most impressive ' linguistic ' performance of chimps and gorillas reported in the literature is at a level roughly equi - valent to that of a human child of approximately two years of age , but that the anthropoids seem to be unable to develop beyond that stage . in particular , they show no evidence for syntactic structure , nor for any ability to distance themselves temporally or spatially from the referents of their statements . i received statements such as the following : ' the most successful of the apes have managed to reach more or less the level of children in the two-word utterance stage . the size of the lexi - con is about the same , as is the combinatory ability . ' ' the apes master a refined system of communication , and are capable of some abstract thinking , but lack the very fundamentals of human language ( recursiveness , structure-dependency , parsing into constituents , etc . ) . ' ' the chimps mostly have a lexicon , and a rudimentary syntax that lets them distinguish between actor and patient , but that 's about all . . . . the chimps ( a ) have no morphology to speak of ( b ) can't use displacement of the message ( i . e . , can't talk about the past or future , or something that happens / ed in another location ) ' [ at a venture , i would guess that they can't handle contrafactuals either . ] ' it is claimed that the ape "" utterances "" lack grammaticality or syntax . the apes can make the correct symbolic associations , but have no sense of grammatical patterning . in two and three "" word "" sentences , the order of the elements is variable and each element maybe repeated any number of times in any order and independently of the rest ( sequences like give banana give kanzi kanzi banana kanzi give , etc . ) ' one of my respondents , partly on the basis of hanns own occasionally frus - trating experiences resulting from the geographical proximity of an insti - tution presumably devoted to the 's tudy ' of anthropoid language , made some critical statements about the scientific methodology of some of this research . in particular , after referring to hockett 's 16 'd esign fea - tures ' of language , hann remarks : ' the proponents ' claim that [ chimps ] do have cultural transmission , because washo taught her son , does n't bear up under much scrutiny ; washo had to be rewarded to learn every sign and her son has not learned as many , nor passed them on to any other chimp . i see what the chimps learned as the equivalent of a pidgin ; but creoliza - tion never took place . ' which implies ( 1 ) that anthropoid ' language ' ac - tually corresponds to the skinnerian model refuted by chomsky in his fa - mous review as regards human language and ( 2 ) that it is not sufficiently ' natural ' to the anthropoids for them to feel motivated to transmit it successfully . some of my respondents addressed some of the wider theoretical and metho - dological issues relevant to linguistics implicit in this discussion . one opined ' that some dismissal of ape language research is partly , and unconsciously , motivated by a turf-protection instinct . we ' re all alrea - dy uneasy about the fact that there are certain subfields of linguistics whose importance we acknowledge but which we ' re not personally terribly well-versed in . . . . i think many theoretical linguists breathed a sigh of relief when terrace announced that [ the chimp ] nim had n't really learned human language at all . it meant that they did n't have to worry about mo - difying their theories to fit ape language data . ' another said , ' most linguists do n't really care ( at least not consciously ) about whether apes can learn language as such , but they do care deeply about whether lan - guage is "" sui generis "" and innate or not . . . . as far as linguists are concerned , we ' re divided over chomsky 's claim that language is a geneti - cally-programmed module , rather than an area of knowledge which is han - dled by general cognition . if apes can't learn language at all , that supports the chomskyan view ( which presumably involves some cataclysmic mutation say 100 , 000 years ago , or at least since we split off from the other primates ) . if they can learn some of it , we have evidence for ge - neral cognition ( where apes are presumably less well endowed than us , so you 'd expect partial success ) . ' in further discussion we agreed that this argument only held if we accept a 's trong ' version of the relevant dichotomy implicit in the innateness hypothesis , according to which human linguistic ability is overwhelmingly if not completely independent of general human cognition . i pointed out that even if chimps are demonstrably distinct from us on a genetic level they still share over 98 % of our dna . so even if they share some of our linguistic ability it might mean that they also share some of the distinc - tive genetic endowment that provides it . a more effective test would be on cetaceans or pachyderms , which are nowhere as nearly related to us as chimps are but which appear to have roughly comparable cognitive levels . if they also share a certain amount of our linguistic ability , that would indicate that at least that amount is probably dependent more on general cognitive ability than on any specific genetic endowment . if chimps , dolphins , elephants , whatever , can't master human language but have other modes of communication * not isomorphic * with ours but of * comparable com - plexity and flexibility * , then this would give us the opportunity to stu - dy how much of human language is necessary to the general phenomenon of language and how much is incidental and of relevance only to our species ; it might also enable us to talk about the ' innateness ' of human linguistic ability in terms that would not be offputting to geneticists . on the second question , the basis for the irritation towards academic lin - guists on the part of the proponents of anthropoid language , there was some consensus that they were working with an overly simplistic concep - tion of what constitutes language , and were offended that we refused to share it . typical were the following remarks : ' all the [ proponents ] of animal language , and of its continuity with hu - man language , assume that human natural languages simply * are * the result of communication and use . . . . the basic design of human languages is * not * dictated by use , and we can easily conceive of species that would possess a * radically * different design for language and would communicate just as well , if not better . ' ' the gardners et al . have an extremely elementary grasp of what is real language . they think that if they have a lexicon and bare syntax , that 's all there is . their other argument , that the apes have "" real "" sign lan - guage , is also pitiful . . . . the approach trivializes both oral languages and sign languages . ' there was , however , some acknowledgment that some of the ' blame ' for this state of affairs belongs on our doorstep . the ' trivialization ' just men - tioned was claimed to be due at least in part to inadequacies in state - ments by linguists in the 50 's and 60 's . one respondent in particular pointed to an inveterate tendency to try to identify a single , defining , characteristic as the sine qua non of human linguistic ability , rather than accepting the fact that such important distinctions are often proper - ly made on the basis of mosaics of characteristics . in particular , much research in anthropoid ' language ' has apparently focussed on the ability of chimps and gorillas to coin novel expressions , unanticipated by their human teachers / handlers , on the basis of a finite number of memorized ' lexemes ' and some basic combinatorial principles . this effort has suppo - sedly been motivated by early assertions by academic linguists that what distinguishes human language from all other forms of animal communication is its creative ability . when the gardners , etc . , demonstrate that their apes are capable of similar creativity and we then say , ' very nice but that 's not language ' , they are understandably miffed . in response to this , i think what is necessary is greater tact , humility , and honesty on all our parts . we need to admit up front that we ( or our predecessors ) have oversimplified in the past , and give credit to the ape researchers for helping to elucidate the issues . and we need to make it clear that what chimps , gorillas , and two-year - old humans share is in some sense a * rudimentary * linguistic ability , but not equivalent to what adult humans do . in short , we need to increase everybody 's awareness of the inherent rich - ness and complexity of human linguistic behaviour , which to my mind means we need to devote more time and energy to introductory courses in general linguistics ! harold schiffman reports some encouraging success in this direction with a course on linguistic anthropology at the university of washington . further discussion on the issues raised here is welcome , either in perso - nal communication with me or in general discussion on the list . i hope in the not too distant to be able to post a short list of references to published literature on this subject . best , steven - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *",Safe Email

[can't think of how I'd be running
afoul of the spam filters with this
post, so here's the second try...]Kissinger's book _Does America Need
a Foreign Policy?_ provides a few
handy abstractions:> The ultimate dilemma of the statesman is to strike a balance between
> values [""idealism""] and interests [""realism""] and, occasionally,
> between peace and justice.Also, he views historical American
approaches to foreign policy as a
bundle of three fibers:Hamiltonian - We should only get
  involved in foreign adventures
  to preserve balances of power.Wilsonian - We should only get
  involved in foreign adventures
  to further democracy, etc.Jacksonian - We should never get
  involved in foreign adventures.
  Unless we're attacked.  Then we
  go Rambo.He has tactfully left out the hard
realists*; as for the rest I gather
wilsonians play the idealists, and
hamiltonians act where values and
interests intersect, and jacksonians 
act only when values and interests
overlap.Kissinger himself seems to be a
Hamiltonian; much of the book is
about how he thinks we ought to
be shaping the balance of power
in various foreign regions.Maybe I've been too affected by
Kant, but I can't see that such
a strategy works unless one can
count on a Bismarck runnning it:
how lopsided does the US look if
everyone tries to run a balance
of power politics?- -Dave*

followed the same power politics:
garner popular support by keeping
potential oligarchs down.  In other
traditions, a king is a legitimate
tyrant, and a tyrant an illegitimate
king.  In the US, I'd hope that we,
like Samuel, wouldn't naturally make
such fine distinctions.

"call for papers to the workshop connectionist - symbolic integration : from unified to hybrid approaches to be held at ijcai ' 95 montreal , canada august 19-20 , 1994 there has been a considerable amount of research in integrating connectionist and symbolic processing . while such an approach has clear advantages , it also encounters serious difficulties and challenges . therefore , various models and ideas have been proposed to address various problems and aspects in this integration . there is a growing interest from many segments of the ai community , ranging from expert systems , to cognitive modeling , to logical reasoning . two major trends can be identified in the state of the art : these are the unified or purely and the hybrid approaches to integration . whereas the purely connectionist ( "" connectionist-to - the-top "" ) approach claims that complex symbol processing functionalities can be achieved via neural networks alone , the hybrid approach is premised on the complementarity of the two paradigms and aims at their synergistic combination in systems comprising both neural and symbolic components . in fact , these trends can be viewed as two ends of an entire spectrum . up till now , overall , there is still relatively little work in comparing and combining these fairly isolated efforts . this workshop will provide a forum for discussions and exchanges of ideas in this area , to foster cooperative work . the workshop will tackle important issues in integrating connectionist and symbolic processing . a tentative schedule day 1 : a . introduction : * invited talks these talks will provide an overview of the field and set the tone for ensuing discussions . * theoretical foundations for integrating connectionist and symbolic processing b . definition of the two approaches : * do they exhaust the space of current research in connectionist-symbolic integration , or is there room for additional categories ? * how do we compare the unified and hybrid approaches ? * do the unified and hybrid approaches constitute a clearcut dichotomy or are they just endpoints of a continuum ? * what class of processes and problems is well-suited to unified or hybrid integration ? the relevant motivations and objectives . * what type of model is suitable for what type of application ? enumerate viable target domains . c . state of the art : * recent or ongoing theoretical or experimental research work * implemented models belonging to either the unified or hybrid approach * practical applications of both types of systems research addressing key issues concerning : * the unified approach : theoretical or practical issues involving systematicity , compositionality and variable binding , biologically inspired models , connectionist knowledge representation , other high-level connectionist models . * the hybrid approach : modes and methods of coupling , task sharing between various components of a hybrid system , knowledge representation and sharing . * both : commonsense reasoning , natural language processing , analogical reasoning , and more generally applications of unified and hybrid models . day 2 : d . cognitive aspects : * cognitive plausibility and relations to other ai paradigms * in cognitive modeling , why should we integrate connectionist and symbolic processing ? * is there a clear cognitive rationale for such integration ? ( we may need to examine in detail some typical areas , such as commonsense reasoning , and natural language processing ) * is there psychological and / or biological evidence for existing models ? if so , what is it ? e . open research issues : * can we now propose a common terminology with precise definitions for both approaches to connectionist-symbolic integration and for the location on the continuum ? * how far can unified systems go ? can unified models be supplemented by hybrid models ? can hybrid models be supplanted by unified models ? * limitations and barriers faced by both approaches * what breakthroughs are needed for both approaches ? * is it possible to synthesize various existing models ? workshop format - panel discussions - mini-group discussions : participants will break into groups of 7 / 8 to discuss a given theme ; group leaders will then form a panel to report on group discussions and attempt a synthesis with audience participation - interactive talks : this is a novel type of oral presentation we will experiment with . instead of a classical presentation , the speaker will present a problem or issue and give a brief statement of his personal stand ( 5 min ) to launch discussions which he will then moderate and conclude . - classical slide talks followed by q / a and discussions . workshop co - chairs : frederic alexandre , crin - cnrs / inria - lorraine ron sun , the university of alabama organizing committee : john barnden , new mexico state university steve gallant , belmont research inc . larry medsker , american university christian pellegrini , university of geneva noel sharkey , sheffield university program committee : lawrence bookman ( sun laboratory , usa ) michael dyer ( ucla , usa ) wolfgang ertel ( frw , germany ) limin fu ( university of florida , usa ) jose gonzalez - cristobal ( upm , spain ) ruben gonzalez - rubio ( university of sherbrooke , canada ) jean - paul haton ( crin - inria , france ) melanie hilario ( university of geneva , switzerland ) abderrahim labbi ( imag , france ) ronald yager ( iona college , usa ) schedule : - the submission deadline for participants is february 1 , 1995 . - the authors and potential participants will be notified the acceptance decision by march 15 , 1995 . - the camera-ready copies of working notes papers will be due on april 15 , 1995 submission : - if you wish to present a talk , specify the preferred type of presentation ( classical or interactive talk ) and submit 5 copies of an extended abstract ( within the limit of 5 - 7 pages ) to : ron sun department of computer science the university of alabama tuscaloosa , al 35487 rsun @ cs . ua . edu ( 205 ) 348-6363 - if you only wish to attend the workshop , send 5 copies of a short ( no more than one page ) description of your interest to the same address above . - please be sure to include your e-mail address in all submissions .",Safe Email

in the OAK project, lead them to believe that you have ""something
roughly equivalent"" (ie ""it wasn't 5 years, but it was three intense
years with plenty of overtime"") -- they are playing a bluff in saying
/they/ know the job requirements so you're perfectly within poker
rules to bluff back to say you have it.If you /don't/ have the requisite Right Stuff, the engineers can

"re : grammar / syntax courses at the college freshman / sophomore level i would like to hear from people who teach or know of grammar or syntax courses offered at the college freshman or sophomore level . we teach such a course at north seattle community college . it concentrates on syntax and teaches a formal , traditional approach to it . we even use reed - kellog diagrams rather than phrase structure trees . another piece of the course applies the syntax to the improvement of writing . in that part of the course we use sentence combining . the course was created here by my colleague , edith wollin , and i know that , in its present form , it is probably unique . it should be taught elsewhere , for it is very successful . students praise it and recommend it to other sdtudernts . they even say it makes them better readers ! we present the material at a level and pace that would make it too challenging for many developmental-level students . the course is certainly as rigorous as sany other 100 - level and 200 - level course in most colleges ; indeed , we think it rivals many higher-level courses in usefulness . but we are aware that it does not present the broad linguistics-based grammar covered in the typical 300 - level grammar course . one professor of such a course at the university of washington told me our course sounds like excellent preparation for his . he said he would love to get students who already know what a clause is . i would be grateful to hear from colleagues who know of any kind of grammmar or syntax course at the freshman or sophomore level . thanks . michael kischner north seattle community college seattle , wa 98103 ( 206 ) 528-4540",Safe Email

meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same

"your help needed please - cross - commodity reporting please excuse the long e - mail below - i knew we ' d never get a chance to all get together , and this is somewhat urgent as i have to complete the finance committee presentation for the upcoming bod meeting by the end of next week , and it will include trading results for the lst quarter , reported in accordance with the risk management policy . due to issues noted below , this may require immediate attention by your staff as we have a few short days to come up with the best quality numbers we can . i talked to beth already , and mrm met with chris abel ' s group to see if there was a short cut , but our joint conclusion was that the business unit controllers need to be involved in this process as you are the experts on your businesses and can apply the best judgment to decide on the trading results to be reported to the bod . we ' ll probably need to go with our best estimate of 3 / 30 # s as of end of the day next tuesday or wednesday at the latest . as you recall , the february 12 th bod meeting resulted in a clarification that the bod approved trading limits were limits on the generic commodity groups defined , and accordingly the trading results must be reported consistent with that limit structure ( management reporting can be different of course ) . chris abel ' s global energy operations group has prepared a "" rac "" dpr that attempts to aggregate the commodity groups in accordance with the risk management policy , so that top management and the bod can see enron ' s exposure to individual commodities on a consolidated basis . ( a ) this dpr will not impact actual sharing of p / l from a management reporting / business unit perspective - this is purely for market risk management purposes and reporting to the bod . but commercial management will need to review and sign off on the rac dpr and monitor limits accordingly , as these limits are at an enron level . the specific trading results we need for the bod presentation are the first quarter p / l and average daily var , by commodity group . the first rac dpr available is as of 3 / 30 - so while it has cumulative p / l , var is only as of 3 / 30 . ( note - we ' re also comparing to lq 2000 , but we ' re not going to attempt to resolve cross - commodity reporting for that period except at a high level ) . your participation is needed in resolving : 1 ) cross - commodity reporting per the new rac dpr - both retroactively for the lst quarter , and going forward , and 2 ) rovar ( return on average daily var by commodity group ) for the lst quarter . this aggregation of cross - commodity activity has been completed by chris as of 3 / 30 , so he has what he believes to be p / l aggregated for the quarter in accordance with the policy . what we don ' t have is var on a daily basis as the first time it was calculated on an aggregated basis was on 3 / 30 . obviously we ' re not going to be able to go back and calculate daily var for the entire quarter by commodity group aggregated in this new manner - especially within a week . so it appears we ' ll need to "" swag "" average daily var - by reviewing the cross commodity positions aggregated at 3 / 30 , by considering cross - commodity activity you ' re aware of that took place throughout the quarter , and using our best estimate of the impact on var for this cross commodity activity . due to this adjustment in historical reporting practices , we feel a certain level of due diligence is required for us to feel confident we ' re reporting to the bod in accordance with the policy . and since we only have a few days , i thought a team approach to tackling the review would facilitate a prompt resolution of material issues , and then you and chris ' group can work out your processes and procedures on how to handle going forward as you see fit . when you consider materiality , please involve your market risk contact - while a transaction / position / book may not be material to gas or power , it may be material to global products , weather , etc . . would you please help us with the following : ? confirm your review of chris ' aggregation on the rac dpr at 3 / 30 ( chris ' staff can walk you through ) ? are all the cross - commodity positions you ' re aware of being reported correctly ? ? is there other cross - commodity activity not present at 3 / 30 and consequently not aggregated for the quarter ' s results , but actually present during the first quarter and material ? if so , estimate impact on p / l and average daily var . ? we ' re not expecting an exhaustive search or analysis - perhaps you can simply discuss this issue with the traders who handle this type of activity to get a feel , and if they point on specific material transactions , we can address those ; you can determine best approach ? are there certain books in risktrac that have cross - commodity positions imbedded / combined - either held currently or those that generated significant var or p / l during the quarter ? going forward these will need to be reported separately to facilitate risk reporting , but in the next week what we need is an estimate of the impact on the corresponding commodities , or a conclusion that the impact is immaterial . ? once you ' ve reviewed the summary of cross commodity activity per the rac dpr and per your own knowledge , help us estimate the impact on the respective commodities ' average daily var for the quarter - you can discuss with your market risk contact your recommendation on a reasonable "" swag "" approach . after considering the information above , please provide your assessment on whether you are in fact able to capture and report all the cross - commodity activity , and if not , identify the issues involved and whether it is something that market risk needs to address , or if it will simply take more time to resolve the reporting details . if you have other recommendations on how to get comfortable with the trading results for the quarter , please feel free to pursue those . i do not mean to imply i know how to do your jobs , or that you ' re not doing them - i simply want to coordinate with you to ensure the # s we report to the bod are the numbers you agree with , and that if they ' re not completely accurate given recent implementation , that we are able to articulate and estimate the potential misstatement , if any . as you are the experts on your businesses ' results , i simply wanted to make sure i closed the loop with what we in mrm understand regarding your reporting of the cross - commodity activity and trading results and the application of the policy . on a separate note , we need you to identify p / l related to special transactions that flowed through the dpr , but do not really represent trading activity - examples in the past are sfas 125 transactions and other unique gain / loss events - we ' re reporting lq 2001 and lq 2000 , so whatever we can recall about last year will also be considered . we will be sending you a reconciliation from the dpr to the bod package that we use to document any special adjustments , and will discuss this with you to come to an agreement on adjustments to the dpr reporting to derive true trading activity . these adjustments should be minimal , but we ' d like your input to conclude . thank you for your cooperation , regards , cassandra schultz x 30429 713 858 2618 cell 936 321 2185 home ( a ) for example , north american electricity limits represent enron ' s consolidated na electricity trading activity , without regard to which business unit or commodity group actually executes the trades or holds positions . so if power has some gas positions for hedges or other reasons , these gas trades need to be removed from power var and p / l and combined with gas ' var and p / l , etc . . heating oil positions held outside global products should be aggregated with global products ; global products ' positions in gas and power should be aggregated with gas and power , with corresponding adjustment to global products ' results .",Safe Email

"forwarded : ucla jobs / temporary ( 97-98 ) ucla jobs / temporary ( 97-98 ) priority normal the ucla department of linguistics expects to have several short-term jobs available teaching various courses in the coming academic year ( 1997-98 ) . most of the positions are in the area of syntax , though we will hire in other areas too . these are all replacement positions , for faculty who are on leave , and there is no realistic prospect of any of them developing into permanent positions . some of the courses that need to be taught are undergraduate classes , while others are graduate classes . at least three , and possibly as many as five courses will involve syntax courses at various levels , ranging from introductory undergraduate syntactic analysis to advanced graduate seminars . our most pressing need in these areas is during the fall and winter quarters ( see below for an outline of quarter dates ) . in addition , we may need an instructor for two lower-division introductory courses in general linguistics in the winter and / or spring quarters ; one of these is a generic intro to linguistics ; the other is a course surveying the languages spoken in the usa , including immigrant languages , american indian languages , and dialects of english and spanish , covering phonetics , history , and sociolinguistic issues , among others . finally , we will have openings for advanced graduate courses in some of the subfields represented in our department - - such as phonology , phonetics , psycholinguistics , computational ling . , syntax , semantics , specific language areas ( such as african , american indian , etc . ) for these advanced graduate courses , we are primarily interested in hiring relatively senior people with established reputations ( e . g . people who are on leave and who are interested in visiting ucla ) , though more junior applicants will also be considered . because we have a large number of courses available for visitors to teach next year , we are quite flexible in terms of the type and level of appointments . in particular , we may be interested in hiring some people for single-course lectureships ( paying in the neighborhood of $ 7 , 000 to $ 10 , 000 per 10 - week course , depending on seniority ) ; we may also consider full-time appointments for periods of one or two terms , with a courseload of 2 courses per term , and pay levels per course roughly comparable to those mentioned above . finally , we may make appointments with less than full-time teaching loads ( e . g . teaching one course and co-teaching another ) . these visiting positions are not restricted as to rank . we are especially interested in hiring faculty from other universities who plan to be on leave during ( part of ) the coming academic year and who may be interested in visiting our department for part of the year and teaching a course ( or two ) while they are here . each course runs for ten weeks ( with two 2 - hour lectures per week ) followed by an exam week . applicants should send a letter of application , including a cv , a statement of previous teaching experience , as well as the names , addresses , and phone numbers of three recommenders to : tim stowell ( chair ) , department of linguistics , ucla , los angeles , ca 90095-1543 . ( actual letters of recommendation should not be sent at this time ; likewise candidates should not send voluminous dossiers of publications , etc . ) applications for fall quarter courses should be received by aug . 15 1997 , and applications for winter and spring quarter courses should be received by sept . 10 1997 , though late applications will also be considered as long as the positions remain unfilled . potential applicants are strongly encouraged to inform us by e-mail , as soon as possible , of their intention to apply for these positions . initial enquiries by email may be directed to tim stowell ( stowell @ ucla . edu ) or to anna meyer ( meyer @ humnet . ucla . edu ) . ucla is an equal opportunity employer . - - - - - - - - - - tim stowell chair , ucla department of linguistics 405 hilgard ave . los angeles , ca 90095-1543 usa phone : 1-310 - 825-0634 fax : 1-310 - 206-5743 e - mail : stowell @ ucla . edu",Safe Email

"lincoln electric louise , i understand there is concern that the value associated with the assignment of the lincoln electric sales agreement to oppd is not sufficient to justify paying $ 1 . 3 million to oppd in order for them to assume this contract . there are some considerations on this contract which i think are important and which may not have been mentioned to you : - the original sales contract to lincoln was entered into several years ago and is one of the contracts sometimes referred to internally as "" toxic waste "" . - about a month ago , we agreed verbally with oppd to accept assignment of the sales contract , as oppd is one of the few parties which can serve it . - the execution of the documents has been delayed by lincoln , who were initially refusing to consent to the assignment - we have another , larger under - water transaction with oppd which we would like to move off the books at some point . we ' d like to keep oppd happy to improve the chances that we can negotiate their buyout of our other sales contract to them ) - if we fail to deliver , we will be subject to penalties in the amount of $ 45 , 0000 per mw on top of liquidated damages ( lincoln is 15 mw for 02 and 30 mw for 03 ) . - this is a highly constrained area ( only 6 counterparties can physically deliver in this area and oppd is the only one which has the surplus power in order to serve lincoln ) : the chance that we will be unable to deliver is high . - there is intangible value associated with not being in a situation where enron fails to deliver . - even if we do wind up serving the contract , the highly constrained nature of the area means we will likely be forced to pay extortionate prices for the power we do acquire . - trading wishes to be out of this contract for aforementioned reasons and the fact that it will be very labour intensive to serve ( day - ahead notice on 20 % monthly load factor ) obviously , if the above is not sufficient justification to put the money out the door now , then we will smooth things as much as possible with oppd - but i wanted to make sure you had all the info . before we kill the deal . terri has stalled oppd until monday . dave",Safe Email

you sent doesn't support packages named ""kernel-smp""). I'd also prefer a
cleaner way than the env variable, and preferrably not editing the spec...
probably ""--define 'target 2.4.xx-xx' --with smp"". Sound good enough?
The BuildRequires on ""kernel-source"" will also need to be removed because
it won't necessarily need to be true, and that does bug me a bit :-/More ideas are welcome.

TextAloud MP3 converts text to speech and to MP3 
Listen to email, Web pages, e-books, and more on your PC or 
portable MP3 player.  As featured in PC Magazine, The New 
York Times, and on CNN.  Now available with optional
AT&T Natural Voices, the most advanced computer speech for your PC. 
Listen to a demo, then 
download your trial copy.
Lockergnome's Guide to Converting Vinyl LPs to CD is no longer free. 
Over the last 10 days, almost 4,000 people downloaded the free tome. 
Of that 4,000, close to half put in a fake e-mail address, resulting 
in a ridiculous number of bounce messages in my inbox. Add to that 
the fact that several of the clever individuals used other people's 
real addresses, which then amounted to complaints of spam from the 
address owners. It's not worth providing a free service if it causes 
Lockergnome to be labeled a spammer as a result. The crowning gem was 
the in-duh-vidual who used the name A** Hole and Chris's personal 
address to download the PDF. On a more positive note, the guide is 
now available in all six formats,  
for the minimal price of $5, complete with some additional content 
based on a couple reader suggestions.Chris may have an obsession with Peets coffee, but I'll bet he's never 
been the daily special. On my visit to St. Louis, for the 
SIC, I 
started every morning with a walk to the West Port Starbucks. 
Apparently my morning ritual was a source of entertainment for the 
employees, which evolved into discussions of a reality based TV show 
based on the concept of stalking me. I've even got the 
incriminating evidence 
to prove it.The SIC provided me the opportunity to see some cool updates to a couple 
titles, in addition to being introduced to some useful audio oriented 
titles I'd never seen before. Expect a number of reviews over the next 
several weeks, as well as extensive coverage of last week's events in 
St. Louis in the annual SIC special issue. Lori managed to score a few 
more Gnomedex giveaways while we were in attendance, so those of you who 
sign up will be coming home with even more goodies, which, by the way, 
aren't of the stressball and pen variety -- we're talking software 
titles with reg codes.

DreamQuest Championship Card Games
For Pocket PC, Palm, Symbian OS
http://www.dq.com/palm.htmlPlaying games on a PDA has killed plenty of my time spent waiting in 
airports around the US. With the recent porting of these three classic 
PC card games from DreamQuest, I've added some of the best in PC 
entertainment to my arsenal of PDA diversions. Hearts, Spades and Euchre 
all play in a similar manner to their PC versions, only on a smaller 
screen. Available for Pocket PC, Palm, and even the Symbian OS, you can 
play cards against computer opponents or connect to the online game room 
and challenge other players using any of the games multiple platforms. 
This is a unique experience currently unavailable for any other pocket games. Â GnomeSKIN

Rexway

Blending punk rock attitude with country twang makes for a fairly 
unique musical experience. I saw these guys play a show in Omaha, 
back in January of this year and was blown away by their stage 
presence. Rexway rip through an opening set with enough energy to 
kick-start even the most somber crowd, moving everyone in the 
audience to their feet and setting the scene for an entertaining 
evening. As with most punk, the lyrics are equal parts politics 
and angst, with enough colorful language to drop a jaw or two. 
Tool fans should check out the countrified version of the classic 
HWAP; it's kind of like a cover tune, only more unique. If you 
are offended by 4-letter words, this band isn't for you.

Click for DetailsCroupier (NR) 1998
Drama - 94min
Reviewer's Tilt (9)Special DVD Features worth a look-Deleted scenesIn disembodied first person Clockwork style narration,  Croupier
pessimistically compares our lives to those of hapless casino gamblers.
We know the odds are stacked against us, yet we continue to play the
games. Gamblers, or ""punters"" as they are more derogatorily known,
however, play their games under the watchful eyes of the croupier
(casino dealer).  Constantly pulled by the siren song of fast money, the
croupier knows better than anyone that to play is to lose. Thus, the
cool croupier relegates himself to his addiction of watching others
lose. Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is the croupier, raised by his croupier
father (Nicholas Ball) who taught him all the tricks of the trade.
Through his losses both in the casino and in his personal life, Jack's
father also taught Jack that the only way to win is not to play. Punters
are sorry sods; the croupier is king. From father to son, the lesson
passes -- watching others strive and falter is the only real enjoyment
in life. Despite decades of croupier training, Jack is compelled to
write the great novel burning deep inside him, yearning to escape.
Jack's publisher regrettably relates to Jack that his novel idea is
trite; stories of real life graft and corruption are what sell. When
Jack's father informs Jack of a casino opening in a small London Casino,
Jack snatches the opportunity to parlay his skill into a novel exposing
the seedy underbelly of London's casinos. Unfortunately, Jack's ex-cop
girlfriend sees the job hardening and irreparably changing Jack for the
worst. In an attempt to fool himself, Jack creates alter ego ""Jake"" to
bear the brunt of inequity, attempting to maintain Jack both morally and
physically unscathed. The absence of any clear delineation between the
personas becomes apparent when a lovely punter (Alex Kingston)
approaches Jack with a scheme to rob the casino. Jack slowly comes to
the realization that no one can have it both ways, either in the casino
or in life. You are either in the game, or you are not. Seasoned veteran
director Michael Hodges deftly crafts this tale around the subtle
talents of the ultra cool Clive Owen. Owen rules this drama, not with
flex and volume, but with glances and nods. Less is truly more, much
more, in this low budget escape from the unsatisfying blockbuster
suspense films of recent memory. Croupier proves that it is not a large
budget, but direction, dialogue and acting that drive the genre.

FROM:MR. DESMOND STEVENS                     URGENT ASSISTANCE. 
YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO RECEIVE THIS LETTER FROM ME SINCE YOU DO NOT KNOW ME PERSONALLY. I AM MR.DESMOND STEVENS, THE FIRST SON OF DR. DENNIS STEVENS, WHO WAS RECENTLY MURDERED IN THE LAND DISPUTE IN ZIMBABWE. I WAS FURNISHED WITH VIABLE INFORMATION FROM THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE HERE IN AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS AND DECIDED TO WRITE YOU. 
BEFORE THE DEATH OF MY FATHER, HE HAD TAKEN ME TO AMSTERDAM TO DEPOSIT THE SUM OF TEN MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$10,500,000) IN A SECURITY COMPANY, AS IF HE FORESAW THE LOOMING DANGER IN ZIMBABWE. THIS MONEY WAS DEPOSITED IN A BOX AS GEMSTONES TO AVOID MUCH DEMURRAGE FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY. THIS AMOUNT WAS MEANT FOR THE PURCHASE OF NEW MACHINES AND CHEMICALS FOR THE FARMS AND ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW FARM IN SWAZILAND. THIS LAND PROBLEM CAME WHEN ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT MR. ROBERT MUGABE, INTRODUCED A NEW LAND ACT THAT WHOLLY AFFECTED RICH WHITE FARMERS AND SOME FEW BLACK FARMERS. THIS RESULTED TO THE KILLING AND MOB ACTION BY ZIMBABWE WAR VETERANS AND SOME LUNATICS IN THE SOCIETY. INFACT, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS LAND REFORM ACT OF WHICH MY FATHER WAS ONE OF THE VICTIMS. IT IS AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND THAT MY FAMILY AND I WHO ARE CURRENTLY STAYING IN AMSTERDAM DECIDED TO TRANSFER MY FATHERï¿½S MONEY TO 
 A FOREIGN ACCOUNT. SINCE THE LAW OF THE NETHERLANDS PROHIBIT A REFUGEE (ASYLUM SEEKER) TO OPEN ANY ACCOUNT OR TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. 
AS THE ELDEST SON OF MY FATHER, I AM SADDLED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SEEKING A GENUINE FOREIGN ACCOUNT WHERE THIS MONEY COULD BE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF MY GOVERNMENT WHO ARE BENT ON TAKING EVERYTHING WE HAVE GOT. I AM FACED WITH THE DILEMMA OF INVESTING THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR THE FEAR OF GOING THROUGH THE SAME EXPERIENCE IN FUTURE SINCE BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR HISTORY. MOREOVER, THE NETHERLANDS FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICY DOES NOT ALLOW SUCH INVESTMENT FROM ASYLUM SEEKERS. AS A BUSINESSMAN, WHOM I HAVE ENTRUSTED MY FUTURE AND MY FAMILY IN HIS HANDS, I MUST LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS RISK FREE. IF YOU ACCEPT TO ASSIST ME AND MY FAMILY, ALL I NEED YOU TO DO FOR ME IS TO MAKE ARRANGEMENT AND COME TO AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS SO THAT YOU CAN OPEN THE NON-RESIDENT ACCOUNT WHICH WILL AID US IN TRANSFERRING THE MONEY INTO ANY ACCOUNT YOU WILL NOMINATE OVERSEAS. THIS MONEY I INTEND TO USE FOR INVESTMENT. I HAVE
  OPTIONS TO OFFER YOU, FIRST YOU CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY FOR NOMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT FOR THE TRANSACTION, OR YOU CAN GO INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH ME FOR A PROPER PROFITABLE INVESTMENT OF THE MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY. WHICHEVER OPTION YOU CHOOSE, FEEL FREE TO NOTIFY ME. I HAVE MAPPED OUT 5% OF THIS MONEY FOR ALL EXPENSES INCURRED IN PROCESSING THIS TRANSACTION. IF YOU DO NOT PREFER A PARTNERSHIP, I AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU 25% OF THE MONEY WHILE THE REMAINING 70% THAT IS MEANT FOR ME, WILL BE FOR THE INVESTMENT IN YOUR COUNTRY. 
PLEASE, CONTACT ME WITH THE ABOVE TELEPHONE AND E-MAIL ADDRESS, WHILE I IMPLORE YOU TO MAINTAIN THE ABSOLUTE SECRECY REQUIRED IN THE TRANSACTION. 
YOURS FAITHFULLY, 
DESMOND STEVENS. --

import the right gpg public keys directly with rpm, for example :
rpm --import /usr/share/doc/apt-0.5.4cnc7/RPM-GPG-KEY
(this will import my key, which is used to sign all freshrpms.net packages)Hopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install *only* packages who

1. Use of $Config is gradually being removed, thankfully.  I don't want
to see any of that stuff in there if it acn be avoided, as different
perl versions jsut vary so much in that stuff.2. perl has no concept of where the rules could be -- unless they're in
the perl libdir (/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.x.x/foo).  Perl does not
know about the existence of /usr/share or /etc.  Used to use /usr/lib/perl5

we need an out-of-band way to tell SA where to find this stuff. that's
the problem!3. try ""perl Makefile.PL < /dev/null"" to allow bots to build it.I think I might be missing some details of what you're peeved about,

"semantics / syntax - semantics interface / language acquisition van hout , angeliek ; event semantics of verb frame alternations : a case study of dutch and its acquisition ; 0-8153 - 3128 - 2 , cloth ; pages , $ 91 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics using both theoretical and language acquisition arguments , this study proposes a new model of the lexicon-syntax interface defined in terms of checking event-semantic features . the research is based on dutch verbs and their possible verb frames ( intransitive , transitive , etc . ) and two studies of children 's dutch . the model developed from these cases represents more generally the way in which universal grammar organizes the lexicon of a language and the mapping system that associates a verb 's lexical features with its syntactic projection . the author shows that a predicate 's event-semantic or aspectual properties define the mapping relation between lexicon and syntax , rather than lexical-semantic information of the verb 's event participants , which is the more traditional view . a verb 's appearance in several different verb frames is determined by event type-shifting ; an atelic ( = unbounded ) or a telic ( = bounded ) event type yields different verb frames , and so does a non-causative or a causative event type . these effects can only be captured if the mapping relation is sensitive to event semantics . the two acquisition studies offer a new and unique perspective on verb learning . one is a longitudinal study on the acquisition of light verbs ; the other is an experimental study on the acquisition of intransitive verbs . they show that children are sensitive to event semantics from early in the language acquisition process . e - mail : info @ garland . com",Safe Email

"enron mentions - 11 / 19 / 01 headed for a fall ; companies issued special zero - coupon bonds , assuming they ' d never have to pay them off . now shareholders could be on the hook for a $ 65 billion tab . fortune magazine , 11 / 26 / 01 manager ' s journal : what enron did right the wall street journal , 11 / 19 / 01 j . p . morgan wins ( by not losing as much ) the wall street journal , 11 / 19 / 01 german bank is in talks with enron to buy a unit the new york times , 11 / 19 / 01 bond boom isn ' t likely to lift economy as corporations swap old debt for new the wall street journal , 11 / 19 / 01 preview / week of nov . 19 - 25 investors looking for answers in enron filing los angeles times , 11 / 19 / 01 companies companies issued special zero - coupon bonds , assuming they ' d never have to pay them off . now shareholders could be on the hook for a $ 65 billion tab . janice revell 11 / 26 / 2001 fortune magazine time inc . 131 ( copyright 2001 ) it was an irresistible proposition : borrow billions of dollars , pay no interest , reap millions in tax breaks , and then wait for the debt to simply disappear . that was the promise of zero - coupon convertible bonds , and companies from enron to merrill lynch binged on what seemed like free money . but , of course , there was a catch : for this scenario to play out , a company ' s stock price had to rise sharply - - and quickly . that ' s because investors bought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity - - if the stock tanked , the bonds would no longer be worth converting . so to make them more attractive to buyers , companies had to build in an escape hatch : if the stock price failed to rise sufficiently , investors could "" put "" ( that is , sell ) the bonds back to the company - - in many cases , after just one year . and that ' s exactly what ' s about to happen - - to the tune of some $ 65 billion over the next three years . stock prices have fallen so far that for at least half of these special hybrids , the prospect of conversion is now absurd . it simply won ' t happen . so bondholders are looking to get their money back the first chance they can . and because of the put feature , that is possible . suddenly companies like tyco , comcast , and dozens more are on the hook for billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they ' d never have to pay . that could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies . after all , they ' re the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt comes due . huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay bondholders . companies without enough cash - - and the majority fall into this camp - - are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow money anew . that means sharply reduced earnings . especially at risk are investors in companies with poor credit ratings - - prime candidates for killer refinancing costs . some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay off the debt , creating significant shareholder dilution , especially at current depressed prices . to make matters worse , this is happening at a time when the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrinking . "" this is a ticking time bomb , "" warns margaret patel , manager of the pioneer high yield bond fund , a top - performing junk fund . the seeds of this mess were sown in mid - 2000 , when the stock market started to falter . companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling stock while their share prices were struggling . zero - coupon convertible bonds presented an attractive alternative because companies didn ' t have to make cash interest payments on the bonds ( hence the name "" zero "" ) . instead issuers offered an up - front discount - - for instance , investors would buy a bond for $ 700 and collect $ 1 , 000 when it matured . companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed number of common shares . but the bonds were structured so that conversion would make sense only if the stock price rose significantly - - in many cases , by more than 50 % . with that protective feature ( called the conversion premium ) , zeros took off . corporate issuers would pay no interest , and once their stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels , the debt would be swept away into equity . "" if the bonds are converted , it ' s a home run for everybody , "" says jonathan cohen , vice president of convertible - bond analysis at deutsche bank . that four - bagger , of course , depends entirely on the stock price rising . if it doesn ' t , the bondholders , armed with that handy put feature , can simply sell the bonds back to the company . great for bondholders , but not so hot for the company or its shareholders . but , hey , what are the odds of that happening ? "" cfos and ceos believe that their stock will just continue to go up , "" says cohen . "" they don ' t worry about the bond getting put . "" if all this seems a little complicated , that ' s because it is . a real - life example should help . california - based electric utility calpine issued $ 1 billion in zeros in april to refinance existing debt . at the time , the company ' s stock was trading at about $ 55 a share - - severely undervalued in the opinion of company management . "" we really didn ' t want to sell equity at that point , "" says bob kelly , calpine ' s senior vice president of finance . so the company instead opted to sell zeros , setting the conversion premium at a hefty 37 % . still , with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise significantly to make conversion worthwhile , the bonds weren ' t exactly a screaming buy for investors . so calpine added the put feature : investors could sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase price , eliminating any downside risk . things haven ' t exactly worked out as management had hoped . the stock has since plummeted to $ 25 , and it now has to triple before conversion makes sense . so it ' s looking as though calpine will be liable for the $ 1 billion in borrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this april . there ' s also the refinancing cost . according to kelly , calpine ' s borrowing rate could run in the neighborhood of 8 . 5 % - - an extra $ 85 million per year in cash . "" obviously , nobody plans for their stock to go down , "" kelly says . "" i don ' t think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put . "" calpine ' s potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating is straddling junk . "" if you are a borderline investment - grade company , a financing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the world , "" notes anand iyer , head of global convertible research at morgan stanley . the problem is , there are a slew of companies with far worse credit ratings out there : jeff seidel , credit suisse first boston ' s head of convertible - bond research , estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall into the junk category . and others are at risk of having their ratings downgraded before the put date . today , with junk yielding as much as 5 1 / 2 percentage points above bonds rated investment grade , refinancing can be a pricey proposition . contract manufacturer solectron is one that could well get hit by the high price of junk . it has $ 845 million in zeros that it will probably have to buy back this january , and another $ 4 . 2 billion coming down the pike over the next couple of years . because of slower - than - expected sales , the company was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies . and if solectron ' s credit is downgraded , the zeros would slide into junk status , a situation that could cost the company - - and its shareholders - - tens of millions of dollars in refinancing charges . refinancing isn ' t the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros . companies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds - - up to 3 % of the amount raised . if the debt is sold back , many will have spent millions for what essentially amounted to a one - year loan . "" they ' re getting bad advice , "" claims one banker who didn ' t want to be named . "" look at the fee the banker earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into . "" as if those potential consequences were not scary enough , shareholders can also get whacked when the bonds are first issued . that ' s because some 40 % are bought by hedge funds , which short the company ' s stock ( sell borrowed shares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price ) at the same time that they buy the bonds . if the stock goes down , the shorts make money from their position . if it goes up , they profit by converting the bond to stock . this hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet , at least for a while . grocery chain supervalu , for example , recently lost 10 % of its market cap the day it announced it was issuing $ 185 million in zeros . despite all the pitfalls , the love affair with such pollyanna bonds continues , thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they provide . in fact , the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form of financing . even better , thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code , companies can rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they ' re actually paying . all they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest if certain conditions prevail . verizon communications , for instance , would pay 0 . 25 % annual interest on its $ 3 billion in zero bonds if its stock price falls below 60 % of the issue ' s conversion price . in the eyes of the irs , oddly , that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction , for tax purposes , of 7 . 5 % - - the same rate it pays on its regular debt . ( why ? trust us , you don ' t want to know . ) that adds up to an annual deduction of more than $ 200 million , even if verizon never shells out a dime in interest . not surprisingly , more than half of the zeros issued in 2001 contain similar clauses . "" it ' s an incredible deal for them , "" says vadim iosilevich , who runs a hedge fund at alexandra investment management . "" not only are they raising cheap money , they ' re also doing tax arbitrage .

"" but creative destroyers are not necessarily likable , pleasant folks , which may be part of enron ' s problem today . - - minimization of transaction costs and frictions . enron extended the logic of de - integration to other industries . an integrated paper company , for instance , owns forests , mills , pulp factories , and paper plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate activities better than smaller , specialized firms . enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of "" customers "" and "" suppliers . "" enron envisioned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the bet that the free - market terms would be better than those of the internal operations . the development of free - market benchmarks for the terms by which divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the economy . - - exploiting the optionality in networks . in the old regulated environment , natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pipeline . enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a number of possible sources , opening the customer to the benefits of competition , and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies . enron benefited from controlling switches on the network , so that they could nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use , and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons . this policy , picked up by others in the industry , created tremendous value for both customers and suppliers . - - rigorous risk assessment . the strategy of tailored contracts could easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the trading risks that the firm assumed , and of very strong internal controls . enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among the best anywhere . particularly with the advent of enron online , where enron made new positions valued at over $ 4 billion each day , it became essential to have up - to - the - second information on company - wide positions , prices and ability to deliver . the unexpected bad news from enron has little to do with trading losses by the firm , but with fears among trading partners about enron ' s ability to finance its trading activity . in a world where contracts and trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite , counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance . it was the erosion in equity , rather than trading risk , that destroyed the firm . - - a culture of urgency , innovation and high expectations . enron ' s corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all . the hollywood stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic , hierarchical , formal , slow , and full of excuses . and the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company - - enron only 15 years ago - - is even duller and slower . enron became bumptious , impatient , lean , fast , innovative , and demanding . it bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses , create markets , and transfer within the firm . success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion , and an open - office design fostered brainstorming . the firm ' s organization and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs . this was a lightning rod for the firm ' s detractors . and yet , it could serve as a model for more hide - bound enterprises to emulate . enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformation of american business . it created a ruckus in once - quiet corners of the business economy . it rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in which it did business . it thrived on volatility . the proposed sale of enron to dynegy risks the loss of a major r & d establishment , especially given dynegy ' s track record as a second mover following enron ' s lead . beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time - consuming antitrust review , dynegy ' s greater challenge will be to find a way to make enron ' s spirit of innovation its own . or so we all should hope , because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake their industries . - - - messrs . bodily and bruner are professors at the university of virginia ' s graduate school of business administration . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . j . p . morgan wins ( by not losing as much ) by susanne craig staff reporter of the wall street journal 11 / 19 / 2001 the wall street journal cl ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) you know things are bad on wall street when the winner of a stock - selection contest can ' t come close to breaking even . j . p . morgan chase & co .

' ' in hindsight , we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , told analysts in a conference call last week . those investments ' ' have performed far worse than we ever could have imagined , ' ' he said , citing the azurix water business , of which wessex water is a part , and energy assets in brazil and india . executives from enron were not immediately available for comment today . westlb executives declined to comment . westlb has been aggressively pursuing acquisitions in britain , bidding for british telecommunications ' phone network and the nation ' s railway tracks controlled by the troubled railtrack , which is restructuring under government supervision . neither of those bids has progressed beyond the initial stages . last summer , westlb helped finance the management buyout of the mid kent water company through swan capital , its private equity vehicle . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . credit markets bond boom isn ' t likely to lift economy as corporations swap old debt for new by jathon sapsford staff reporter of the wall street journal 11 / 19 / 2001 the wall street journal cl ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) when at & t last week completed the second - biggest bond sale in history - - capping one of the busiest bond periods in years - - it came as welcome news amid fears of a credit crunch . here was new money , meaning new spending on plants , equipment and jobs that could help pull the economy out of its slump . that $ 10 . 9 billion at & t deal , and a slew of similar bond deals from big companies ranging from boeing and anheuser - busch to kraft foods and general motors , may not provide as big of a boost as economists are banking on . that is because corporations , like homeowners , are in the midst of a refinancing boom . corporations are hitting the market not just because rates are cheap , but because they often can ' t get money in other crucial markets . in particular , they are sidestepping the commercial paper market - - short - term corporate ious used to finance day - to - day operations , where rates traditionally are lowest - - because investors are unwilling to finance many well - known corporations . the result has been a huge jump in bond sales , the majority of which are used to reduce existing debt . since the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , about $ 135 billion in investment - grade bonds have been sold , up from about $ 78 billion in the year - earlier period . overall issuance this year is likely to set a record , clearing $ 600 billion , compared with $ 411 billion in 2000 . "" the driving force behind this surge in bond issuance is refinancing short - term commercial paper to long - term debt , "" says john lonski , chief economist at moody ' s investors service , a credit - rating agency . usually , rising bond issuance presages economic growth . in 1991 , corporations sold a record number of bonds to exploit falling interest rates . but then , companies poured much of the money they raised back into their operations , a flurry of investment that foreshadowed the economic boom of the late 1990 s . this time around , the surge in bond deals won ' t pump in enough new money to the economy to make a dramatic difference . though , as in the case of the millions of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to lower monthly payments , it could help ease some pressure on stretched corporate - balance sheets and help to fund some of the companies ' day - to - day operations . not all of the money being raised is to refinance short - term debt , of course , and the string of bond deals shows that many of the nation ' s biggest borrowers have ready access to funding if they need it . but most companies are similar to at & t , which last week provided the biggest refinancing example yet . over the next three months , the telecom company was facing $ 6 . 5 billion in expiring commercial paper . under normal conditions , corporations pay off maturing commercial paper by "" rolling over "" that debt , or issuing new commercial paper to replace the old . but rolling over commercial paper became much harder for at & t after moody ' s cut the company ' s short - term and long - term credit ratings . through the bond deal , at & t raised money at relatively attractive rates while avoiding the difficulties of the commercial - paper market . other companies facing downgrades also are scrambling to find alternatives to the commercial - paper market through bonds , loans or revolving credit lines . "" the ripple effects of this are being felt throughout the capital markets , "" says meredith coffey , senior vice president at loan pricing corp . , a debt - market - analysis company . for the most extreme cases , the bond markets don ' t offer refuge . enron , hammered by a third - quarter loss of $ 618 million that led to a string of downgrades , drew down $ 3 . 3 billion from its emergency bank credit line to repay investors in its commercial paper . it then turned to its banks for an additional $ 1 billion loan to pay off more commercial - paper investors , thus tiding it over until it could merge with rival dynegy . most investment - grade companies aren ' t nearly so bad off , and thus have ready access to bond investors . general motors , for instance , had little trouble selling $ 6 billion in debt last month , while ford motor easily sold bonds totalling $ 9 . 4 billion . but the surge in bond sales masks signs that even investment - grade companies are having trouble convincing investors that they are good for their money . take ford . standard & poor ' s and moody ' s downgraded ford ' s debt ratings last month to triple - b - plus and single - a - 3 , respectively . with that rating , ford is far enough down the spectrum of investment - grade debt that many of the ultraconservative investors in commercial paper won ' t touch it , meaning that it had to turn to corporate bonds to refinance its debt . ford concedes that a big reason it is selling bonds was to avoid the trouble in the commercial - paper market . boyce greer , the money - market group leader at fidelity investments , says he often stops buying the commercial paper of a corporation at the first sign of eroding profitability - - even before they get downgraded . "" you can ' t wait around for a rating agency [ to downgrade a company ] , "" he says . moody ' s has downgraded five times as many corporations as it has raised so far this year . thus , the market for corporate commercial paper has shrunk to $ 1 . 4 trillion at the end of october , down from $ 1 . 6 trillion at the end of last year . - - - friday ' s credit markets last week was a brutal time to own treasurys . the market sold off so sharply as to push yields , which move inversely to prices , almost back up to where they stood before the terrorist attacks . it was the worst bond selloff since 1987 , according to economists at banc one capital markets . losses were heaviest in issues like the two - year note , the most sensitive to expectations about federal reserve policy . since hitting a record low of 2 . 30 % on nov . 7 , the two - year yield has risen 0 . 80 percentage point to 3 . 05 % . in the same period , the 30 - year bond yield has risen 0 . 50 percentage point to 5 . 27 % . at 4 p . m . friday , the benchmark 10 - year treasury note was down 1 3 / 32 points from late thursday , or $ 10 . 94 per $ 1 , 000 face value , at 100 25 / 32 . its yield jumped to 4 . 897 % from 4 . 756 % thursday . the 30 - year treasury bond ' s price fell 1 19 / 32 to 100 25 / 32 to yield 5 . 317 , up from 5 . 211 % thursday . why the selloff ? people in the market cite a shift toward the view that the u . s . economy may finally be on the brink of recovery . that means the fed may not need to employ many more rate cuts to get growth back on track . - - michael s . derby and steven vames copyright ? 2000 dow jones financial desk preview / week of nov . 19 - 25 investors looking for answers in enron filing bloomberg news 11 / 19 / 2001 los angeles times home edition c - 2 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company enron corp . investors hope the energy trader ' s third - quarter report to the securities and exchange commission will answer some of the questions that sent its shares tumbling and led to a proposed sale to rival dynegy inc . enron , which has been criticized for failing to clearly explain how it makes money , may disclose in a filing expected today more on how much is owed by the company and affiliated partnerships , as well as any planned job cuts and other cost - saving moves related to dynegy ' s $ 24 - billion buyout . enron agreed to sell after its stock plunged 67 % in three weeks amid an sec investigation into partnerships run by enron executives . investors worry that new disclosures , such as previously unreported debt , might threaten enron ' s credit rating and scuttle the merger , possibly pushing enron into bankruptcy . enron chairman kenneth lay acknowledged last week that failed investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to dynegy , and he and other executives pledged to be more open with investors . enron shares fell 48 cents friday to close at $ 9 on the new york stock exchange . dynegy fell $ 1 . 53 to $ 42 . 47 . enron ' s third - quarter earnings report , which had been expected last week , was delayed by the dynegy talks and a restatement of earnings , chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said . enron reduced net income for four years by a combined $ 586 million to include losses from affiliated partnerships . today ' s filing , called a 10 - q , will include a balance sheet summarizing assets and debts . enron for years has omitted balance sheets , which the sec requires as part of the 10 - q , from its press releases announcing earnings . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . companies & finance international - dynegy bid faces long wait . by nancy dunne and andrew hill . 11 / 19 / 2001 financial times ( c ) 2001 financial times limited . all rights reserved dynegy ' s $ 9 . 8 bn rescue bid for enron , the larger rival energy group , poses complex and unprecedented regulatory challenges for the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) , which is likely to lead the review of the bid . officials from the two houston - based companies , which announced the deal 10 days ago , estimated the regulatory process would take six to nine months to complete . but the ferc review could take longer , according to experts , and approval of the deal is further complicated by such issues as the parallel securities and exchange commission investigation into enron ' s finances .

"" but they are getting more open , "" mr . oubadia said , though russia ' s lax financial reporting standards are still one of the main roadblocks for foreign investors . with $ 49 million in assets , the pilgrim russia fund invests between 90 % and 95 % in russian stock , with the balance held in cash . "" while the global economy is slowing , russia is still in an expansion mode , "" mr . oubadia said . after years of economic reforms , consumer spending is up 10 % and the former soviet union ' s gross domestic product is expected to grow 3 % to 5 % next year , more than twice as much as that of the u . s . and europe . two - thirds of the fund ' s stocks are oil and gas companies , which are still the most liquid stocks in russia . utilities , mining , telecommunications companies and breweries make up the rest . "" there ' s no escaping oil and gas if you want to manage a russia fund , "" mr . oubadia said . the spike in oil prices earlier this year made the investment in oil worthwhile , propelling earnings growth for russia ' s oil and gas companies . higher oil prices also worked wonders for the russian economy , which is largely dependent on oil and gas . more recently , however , falling oil prices have threatened the companies ' profit growth . but the fund manager , who is based in the hague , said he doesn ' t think people should invest in russian oil stocks because of their earnings prospects . "" you don ' t invest because of earnings growth - - there will be none for russian oil companies this year . you invest because of the stocks ' low valuation , "" mr . oubadia said , adding that most of the russian oil companies still trade well below the world - wide average for the sector . yukos oil is one of the fund ' s largest investments , making up about 12 % of the fund ' s holdings . surgutneftegaz and lukoil holdings also make up more than 5 % each of pilgrim russia ' s assets . while mr . oubadia said the companies should be able to handle falling oil prices , partly by cutting production , he worries that further price erosion could hamper a fragile russian stock market that relies so heavily on oil and gas stocks . "" can russian markets do well with lower prices for oil ? "" he asked . "" the short answer is yes . but how low will prices drop ? "" mr . oubadia acknowledged that weak oil prices might cause him to shift some investments from oil and gas into other russian sectors , including telecom stocks and consumer products . the russia fund isn ' t for the timid . in 1998 , when the russian economy collapsed , the fund - - then called lexington troika dialog russia , lost 83 % of its value . a year later , the fund soared 160 % . in 2000 the fund finished down almost 18 % . - - - janus stock shuffle : janus capital corp . bulked up on lower - priced value stocks and shed some shares of its long - held technology companies during the third quarter , a new securities and exchange commission filing showed . the denver fund firm reported that during the third quarter , it lowered its investments in 14 of the 20 largest holdings it had owned as of june 30 . the largest reduction was a 43 . 6 million - share sale of nokia corp . stock . after the sale , janus still owned a large 183 . 2 million - share position in the wireless - phone company at the end of the third quarter . during the quarter , janus also sold more than half of its stakes in tech companies emc corp . and sun microsystems inc . in addition , the fund company , a unit of stilwell financial inc . , trimmed its exposure to energy company enron corp . , selling 1 . 5 million shares to reduce its overall position to 41 . 4 million shares at the end of september . on the buying side , janus , one of the hottest fund firms of the late 1990 s thanks to bets on leading technology stocks , about doubled its position in software company microsoft corp . it also boosted its holding in the investment company run by warren buffett , berkshire hathaway inc . , while starting a small position in philip morris cos . , whose dividend - rich stock is usually more popular with price - sensitive "" value "" managers . janus has introduced new value portfolios recently , but most of its investors ' assets still follow faster - growing companies . - - aaron lucchetti and todd goren copyright ? 2000 dow jones source : world reporter ( tm ) the sunday telegraph the german state - owned bank , westlb , is in talks to buy wessex water from its troubled us parent enron . westlb is thought to be one of a number of financial buyers to have approached enron with a view to acquiring wessex , which is valued at more than agbplbn ( el . 63 bn ) . enron , the energy trading group which bought wessex in 1998 for agbpl . 4 bn , is being bought by its much smaller us rival dynegy after collapsing into financial crisis . the independent on sunday the water and sewage company wessex water is understood to be up for sale following an offer to take over its owner , enron . three years ago , enron spent agbpl . 4 bn on wessex water . but dynegy is understood to want to concentrate on us and european energy assets and is not interested in non - core assets . any hope to regain the same amount of money could be derailed as the industry is put off by regulatory problems , and the company ' s results have worsened due to imposed price cuts over the past year . copyright ?

2000 dow jones now a sale has become even more urgent . reportedly , tatas and bses are interested ; so are the lending institutions . clearly , if a settlement is to be reached , this is the optimum time . but one is not very optimistic . for one , delhi and mumbai will be involved , and bureaucracies never understand opportunity costs . our byzantine decision - making processes make timely decisions impossible . further , if a deal does take place , there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption . it is much safer for the reputation of the concerned ministers in mumbai and delhi to allow the drift to continue , to "" let the law take its own course "" , whatever the costs ! sadly , as jairam ramesh said in this paper , indian politicians respond to developments only out of compulsion , not conviction . copyright ?

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered !

( nyse : dyn ) beat expectations in the third quarter , reporting that its earnings rose to $ 286 million , or 85 cents per diluted share , from $ 177 million , or 55 cents per diluted share , for the same period in 2000 . this represented a 22 - percent increase from 3 q 2000 and boosted the company ' s 2001 earnings estimate . dynegy has a market capitalization of $ 14 . 5 billion . its stock is currently trading at about $ 43 down from a 52 - week high of $ 59 , although it is important to note that for year - end 2000 the company ' s stock was one of the top performers among standard dynegy , on the other hand , not only believes in the ownership of physical assets , but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the company as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry . let ' s look at the companies separately . we ' ll discuss enron first since it is the older of the two . enron readily admits that its strategy is difficult to define , but a close approximation is that enron literally creates commodity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers . the participation and success in commodity markets , according to enron , does not necessitate ownership of physical assets . in fact , the company has routinely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wholesale business . rather , enron has concentrated on developing a new philosophy of risk management excellence , in which it will merely buy and sell the commodities it needs to participate in trading venues . as an example , enron bought portland general ( which owns 2 , 000 mw of generation and 41 , 600 kilometers of electric t & d lines ) in 1996 as a way to launch its penetration of the west coast power markets . when competition fizzled in that region , enron put portland general back on the sales block ( a sale of portland general to northwest natural is pending at this writing ) . likewise in europe , where it is one of the most prominent trading companies , enron has disposed of generation assets such as sutton bridge in england and , unlike other u . s . competitors , has refrained from buying additional generating units in opening countries such as germany and italy . according to its most recent 10 k report filed with the securities and exchange commission , enron owns or controls 2 , 015 mw of generating capacity ( including joint ownerships ) , which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector . dynegy ' s approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different from enron ' s . in the words of ceo chuck watson , "" dynegy ' s long - term strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets , which supports earnings sustainability . "" ever since going public in 1995 , dynegy has been on an acquisition binge , with each purchase significantly increasing its generation capability . dynegy presently owns or controls about 27 , 000 mw of generating capacity in the united states , 26 gas - processing plants and 14 , 000 miles of pipelines , which are located in geographically competitive areas . the company ' s goal is to own or control 70 , 000 mw , or 10 percent of the u . s . market , within the next five years . sometimes , dynegy has acquired assets through partnerships with other companies such as nrg energy , but just as often it has purchased assets independently . most notably , when dynegy acquired illinova in early 2000 , the purchase doubled dynegy ' s generating capacity . dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in europe , where it is presently planning to purchase natural - gas storage facilities in england . dynegy executives have argued that natural - gas storage is the best way to back up a natural - gas trading operation . there ' s no question that the approach is working . out of the $ 286 million that dynegy reported in the third quarter , $ 263 million of it came from the company ' s main wholesale business . the issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference between enron and dynegy , and its significance should not be overlooked . it is not difficult to make a case that supports dynegy ' s approach . owning physical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the course of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price . in other words , by controlling the actual output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells , a trader such as dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region , how much power can be produced to meet that load and when shortages might occur . in addition , in markets that are short on infrastructure , it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region . by the same token , those companies that do control physical assets often have greater communication with grid operators , and possible insight to spreads ( the difference between various energy prices ) . in fact , dynegy ' s ceo watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around the volatility of price , and being capable of resolving balances when shortages exist . this may be more difficult for a company such as enron to accomplish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids . dynegy ' s strategy of acquiring both natural - gas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities . on the other side of this argument , a case could be made that enron ' s approach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility . certainly , by investing less in power generation facilities , enron has less capital on the line when compared to a company like dynegy . under a scenario when market prices suddenly drop , a company such as enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an asset - laden company because enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixed payments of a generation facility . asset - heavy companies also may find that their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilities in times of extreme price volatility . as the industry becomes increasingly focused on bottom - line results , this could be seen as a potential concern for investors . further , some would argue that enron ' s approach of establishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell requirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility . what enron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own portfolio . consequently , the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the "" great debate "" among power traders . however , although dynegy ' s overall performance in the third quarter was better than enron ' s , that does not necessarily provide a clear endorsement of dynegy ' s strategy toward acquiring new generation facilities . keep in mind that enron ' s 3 q losses resulted primarily from non - recurring charges related to its non - core businesses ( broadband and water in particular ) . without these charges , enron ' s core wholesale trading business continues to perform well . this is a point that ceo ken lay has been quick to reiterate to investors . "" our 26 - percent increase in recurring earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural - gas pipelines , "" lay said . "" the continued excellent prospects in these businesses and enron ' s leading market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook . "" moreover , perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets , the key issue that played a role in the current disparity between dynegy and enron earnings in the third quarter is the companies ' approach to developing new lines of business . telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point . enron , which prides itself as usually gaining a first - strike advantage , plunged into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies . under the leadership of then - ceo jeffrey skilling , enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quickly become lucrative . now lay admits that the company "" could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital "" and that enron "" spent too much too soon "" in this sector . nevertheless , enron recorded an $ 80 - million non - recurring write - down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by reducing future costs in this sector to $ 40 million a quarter . dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared to enron . dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom sector , but in the third quarter took a $ 15 - million loss in its broadband business compared to the $ 80 - million loss that enron reported . however , dynegy clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities ( electricity and natural gas ) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical way that merely supplements its core business . it is also important to note that enron gained the first - strike advantage when it developed enrononline , an electronic trading exchange . in fact , enron was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space , well ahead of its competitors . dynegy later followed this trend with creating dynegydirect . the two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards , but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case enron was successful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors . the latest available information indicates that enrononline has recorded transactions that exceed $ 590 in notional value . since its inception in november 2000 , dynegydirect has recorded $ 33 billion in notional transactions . at this juncture , dynegy and enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting . enron , which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors , is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the securities and exchange commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by enron ' s cfo . to my recollection , no one has ever accused dynegy of not providing a balance sheet , and thus the company ' s status with investors is arguably more solid . as i don ' t expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon , my projection is that ( at least in the near term ) , we will continue to see a wide disparity in wall street performance between dynegy and enron . that is not to say that anyone should count enron out of the game . as noted , the company ' s core business of wholesale business remains strong , but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non - core businesses . that doesn ' t mean enron is down permanently , but it will have to find a way to strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and those businesses that former ceo jeffrey skilling believed were advantageous . in many ways , the comparison between dynegy and enron is rather like the tortoise and the hare parable . i am sure you can guess which company is the tortoise and which is the hare in this analogy . the race between the two is far from over , although dynegy is taking the lead at this point , based on its more methodical approach . what will be fascinating to observe is how both companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly modify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies . _ _ _ _ _ correction statement to 10 / 23 issuealert on european trading : according to a news report from reuters , the u . s . -

"sum : native speaker intuitions several weeks ago i posted a question about the current status of "" native speaker intutions "" in our discipline . in particular , i wondered about the problems posed by variations in the interpretation of sentences . such variations sometimes become apparent when i teach "" modern english grammar , "" a course that treats english syntax in nonformal , surface-structure terms and primarily is aimed at nonlinguists . in my post , i mentioned two sentences that gave rise to varying intuitions , but i will discuss in this summary only the first , viz . , "" john asked mary to leave , "" which one student claimed was ambiguous between the reading where mary would do the leaving and that in which john would do the leaving . she claimed she got this second reading by thinking something like "" john asked to leave , "" which clearly means that john would leave , and who he asked was mary . before i continue this discussion , i must point out that in my class i did not solicit interpretations of this sentence , nor did i expect any challenges to my reading , which i essentially presupposed , assuming - - erroneously - - that all my students saw it as i did . perhaps i did not make this point clear in my posting to this list , since several respondents implied that problems will arise when we solicit interpretations or judgments , or indeed if we do "" generative "" grammar at all . however , though my approach to syntax in this course is not generative and i did not request an interpretation for this sentence , students sometimes will challenge my assumptions about meaning . if the students involved were merely contentious , then i would chalk up such differences to personality and continue unabashed . but describing my students as contentious in this case would certainly be a distortion . their observations arose , it seems to me , out of a genuine desire to come to grips with the issue . several respondents pointed out that recent research in syntax has had to deal with the thorny issue of interpretation . georgia green reports that one of her students , tim williams , "" has just completed a dissertation on infinitive complements , and one of the major points is that , as illustrated by the reaction to . . . ' john asked mary to leave , ' the subject of the infinitive in so - called equi constructions is not syntactically fixed . ( his dissertation deals with articulating the pragmatic principles that govern the interpretation , and misled us for so long into thinking that the interpretation was syntactically fixed . ) "" both dan alford and dale russell noted that the interpretation of a sentence such as "" john asked mary to leave "" as meaning "" john asked mary 's permission to leave "" could be enhanced if there were a power / status differential between the two nps . dale wrote that "" real-world stuff makes us lean toward one [ reading ] or the other to the point where we ' re not even aware of the potential ambiguity . "" he provides an example of such real-world stuff in "" johnny asked the teacher to go get a drink of water , "" a sentence in which it is far easier to read the subject of the sentence as also being the subject of the infinitive . he points out that "" we ' ve only changed lexical items , made the first object someone who is likely to be in a position to grant permission , and the subject of the sentence someone who is likely to want to perform the action of the infinitival . "" following this line of inquiry , tony bex offers an enlightening pair of examples : [ 1 ] the teacher asked the child to leave the room . [ 2 ] the child asked the teacher to leave the room . he contends that these sentences "" are typically interpreted pragmatically taking into account perceived authority ; i . e . , in [ 1 ] the teacher tells the child to leave ; in [ 2 ] the child asks whether s / he can leave . "" in either case , it is likely that it is the child who will be leaving . i should note that this pair of examples proved to be particularly amusing and illuminating to my students - - especially to those who , like me , found the ' permission ' reading peculiar . tony 's examples demonstrated to them to what extent pragmatic knowledge plays a part in interpretation . the responses to the infinitive problem constituted only one of several lines pursued by my respondents . some , who like me teach undergraduate syntax courses , commented on the difficulty a few students have with even rudimentary syntactic analysis ( e . g . , the subject / predicate split , often claimed to be a universal strategy among english speakers ) . others commented on the familiar problem of intuition fatigue ( which could be summed up as "" say a weird string 50 times and it sounds good ; say a good string 50 times and it sounds weird "" ) . and still others took issue with the entire enterprise of a separate syntax , particularly of the generative variety , though by now it should be clear that any decontextualized sentence has the potential to give rise to more than one intepretation . in fact this very idea is discussed in carson schutze 's forthcoming book , _ the empirical base of linguistics : grammaticality judgments and linguistic methodology _ , to be published by university of chicago press in 1995 . in his post to me , carson contends that judgment data "" can provide real , useful data , if we would just be more systematical and careful about how we collect them . of course speakers will differ on certain points . . . . the interesting question is whether the range of variation we find is systematically constrained in ways that interesting theories of grammar can explain . "" finally , one last thread was contributed by larry hutchinson , who mentioned the history of introspection in this century : "" in point of fact , the first psychology labs had been set up by introspectionists , but they were completely taken over by behaviorists and introspection dumped . . . . linguists in the 50 's were pretty much under the sway of behaviorists , and emotionally against introspectionism . . . . but then the enthusiasm generated by chomsky just swept away the behaviorist viewpoint , and along with it the contempt for the unguided use of speaker opinions . "" i thank all of my respondents ( cited below ) for their insightful and helpful remarks . i hope i have not distorted their positions in any serious way . marilyn silva respondents : dan alford , mark arnold , laurie bauer , kirk belnap , tony bex , scott delancey , jakob dempsey , susan ervin - tripp , georgia green , larry hutchinson , ingo plag , jim jewett , jules levin , chris li , steve matthews , dan maxwell , micheal palmer , jeanmarie rouhier , dale russell , mary ellen ryder , carson schutze , linda shockey , jacques steyn , and one respondent who prefers to remain anonymous",Safe Email

Brooklyn Bridge for sale! No kidding! The town of Brooklyn, 
Iowa has a bridge that they are selling on Ebay, so if you have a need for such 
a structure, or just want to have the right to say you 
legitimately purchased the Brooklyn Bridge, here's your 
opportunity! Seriously, this is not a prank!Ever since I was down toward Des Moines last week and had 
a cup-o-java with Jake at Starbucks, I've been craving 
coffee. I can't see myself turning into a coffee junkie like 
Chris, but it's just weird that this would happen, being 
that my extent of coffee drinking has usually been limited 
to the severe need for a quick morning wake-up or in an 
effort to keep warm on cold mornings when out in the field 
back in my Marine Corps days. As time has gone on, I've been trying to cut back on the 
typical geek vices of sugar and caffeine, but I can't drink 
coffee straight. It has to be sweet, and what's the point of 
drinking coffee if there's no caffeine? Enter Splenda. An 
artificial sweetener that has finally made it to Waterloo, 
Iowa. Most of what Diana and I use sugar for has been 
modified to use Splenda instead, with good results. 
Hopefully this coffee thing is just a temporary kick like it 
usually is. I have to brush my teeth after a cup or two from 
the nasty breath. It's fun to test out the dragon-breath on 
the cat to see just how bad it really is. If Bootes sniffs a 
couple of times, it's not too bad, but if she instantly 
recoils, time to employ the Sonicare for a couple of 
minutes. See what you've started, Jake?See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeNETWORK
Exchange Titanium Details Emerge
http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/07-15exchangeqa.asp
Oracle recently announced their intention to compete 
directly with Microsoft Exchange, even accepting Outlook as 
an email client. In what seems like a direct response, we're 
handed details of the 2003 release of Exchange Titanium. 
I've always liked what Exchange can do, so I'm certainly 
looking forward to seeing what the new features will be all 
about, but I'm also interested in what Oracle will be 
bringing to the table. Better email functionality, control 
and security are the name of the game, whoever ends up being 
the vendor of choice. Included in this Q&A is a screenshot 
of what Outlook may look like once Office 11 is released. 
It's an interesting concept shot, showing some new ways they 
plan to handle email views. It doesn't say anything for 
Exchange functionality, but it's worth noting regardless.

Better Pocket PC Audio
Unearthed by David Spencerhttp://home.adelphia.net/~mdukette/downloads.html
An open source project is bringing a different spin to 
audio and video on Pocket PCs, and my first impression is... 
cool! I like what they're working on here. I decided to wipe 
out my Jornada yesterday, so I haven't done a direct 
comparison between the iPaq 3870 and Jornada 565 for audio 
quality using this player, which has an equalizer built-in, 
but it definitely has potential judging from how it sounds 
on the iPaq right out of the gate. Definitely give this a 
peek if you're one of those that likes to play audio and 
video on a Pocket PC. Quite a few different versions are 
supported, so you should be able to find something 
appropriate to your device.

http://news.com.com/2100-1001-944053.html
Three readers asked me about this very thing this week, 
and it's something you should probably know about if you use 
Windows XP. Microsoft didn't bundle the Java Virtual Machine 
with Windows XP, and since the release of XP, the JVM has been avaialble via the 
Windows Update site as a ""convenience"" to users. Part of Sun's legal
complaints surrounding how Microsoft has handled Java was that Microsoft did not have the right to 
distribute their implementation via the web, though 
they did have licensing rights to include it with Windows. 
So essentially, Microsoft has things backwards, as it seems. 
Well, to avoid further web distribution arguments, Microsoft 
has yanked the JVM from the Windows Update site and all 
other areas of Microsoft's web site. Microsoft is still 
planning to include Java with Windows XP Service Pack 1. 
You'll have to plan for Java support accordingly, as SP1 is 
still a ways off and you can't get it from Microsoft at this 
point. If you need it for a new installation of Windows XP 
in the short term, Sun will gladly provide you with their 
own distibution.

Another Xeon Deal
Served up by Warren Dugashttp://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?sku=C170-1032%20P
I mentioned a really nice deal on Compaq Evo W6000 dual-
Xeon workstations a few weeks back, which I know several of 
you took advantage of, but the $1999 price tag likely scared 
off many others. If you still want to get into a Xeon, check 
this one out. TigerDirect is offering an Evo W8000 
workstation with a single 1.7GHz processor, 18.2GB 15,000rpm U160 
drive, 48x CD-ROM and licenses for both Windows 2000 Pro and 
NT 4.0 Workstation for $699.99. Note that there is NO memory 
and no video card included, so you'll have to scrounge those for 
yourself, but it really is a pretty good deal, on the whole. 
Also realize that these systems take RAMBUS memory, which 
will add a bit of cost, so be sure you know what you're 
getting - a wicked-fast workstation, to be sure! Expandability is also quite amazing with these machines. Recommend It!http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/techspecialist/20020717.html

10)  Subscription InformationTHE ISO17799 TOOLKIT UNCOVERED
===============The ISO17799 standard can be acquired either stand alone or as part of
an introductory pack appropriately called 'The ISO17799 Toolkit'. But
why was it packaged thus, and what is included in the pack?  The purpose of the toolkit is to help organizations get off to a flying
start with respect to ISO17799... not only to understand the standard
itself but to begin to address many of the standard's requirements more
quickly.The contents can be broken down into two groups: those that help the
organization to understand where ISO17799 fits and what is involved in
embracing it, and those that help an organization to take the first
critical steps to compliance.In the former group are the 'RoadMap to Certification' (which broadly
describes the process of gaining certification), the 'XL Management
Presentation' (which explains the history, background and current status
of the standard) and of course the ISO17799 standard itself (both
parts).In the latter group are some key items to aid compliance. These include
a comprehensive set of ISO17799 compliant security policies to address
section 3 (Security Policy) and business continuity audit checklists to
help address section 11 (Business Continuity Management).It doesn't end there, however. For the audit section there is a detailed
set of audit questionnaires to address various issues and platforms. For
newcomers to information security there is even a substantial glossary
of terms.  Clearly, creating such a toolkit was a significant undertaking. However,
in terms of helping organizations exploring the initial stages of
ISO17799, it can be invaluable. More information on the ISO17799 Toolkit and how to purchase can be
found at: http://www.iso17799-made-easy.comThe standard itself can alternatively be procured from:  
http://www.iso17799.net SOCIAL ENGINEERING - ARE YOU SUSCEPTIBLE?
====================
The term 'social engineering' can conjure up a variety of ideas, usually
based around the concept of genetic tampering. However, when applied to
IT security, it has its own implications and its own vocabulary.Following interviews with known computer criminals, a list of approaches
has been produced. These are designed to gather information without the
target even realizing that they have parted with it.The attempts are often made on an opportune bases, with common locations
for this sort of activity being planes, trains and pubs. The telephone
is probably the major source of pre-meditated acts.  The following are some of the major techniques employed:BAITING
This essentially involves asking a variety of questions, including some
leading questions designed to 'catch' the right answers. Often, items of
conversation are introduced based upon replies received. The fiction is
legitimized with small amounts of fact in the right places.PULLING RANK
This amounts ot the perpetrator assuming a more senior position in the
company than the victim and is usually enacted on the telephone. It does
not necessitate direct impersonation... only the POSITION needs to be
assumed. EXHAUSTING
This involves asking a constant stream of similar questions to wear down
the target.SURF BOARDING
Basically this is looking over someone's shoulder at something
confidential. This could be directly, through a window, through a
doorway, etc.SURVEYS
The information given freely in surveys can often be extremely useful to
a criminal. The surveys can initially be for entirely legitimate
purposes, or can be completely bogus from the start. In either case
sensitive information can often be obtained and unwittingly disclosed.
There are of course many other techniques. However, disclosure can be
prevented via the use of a series of common sense rules and policies. Before releasing any information it is essential to at least establish:a) the sensitivity of the information
b) your authority to exchange or release the information
c) the real identity of the third party (proper authentication)
d) the purpose of the exchangeThe act of exchange should also be recorded for audit purposes.ISO17799 - A WORLD WIDE PHENOMINA ================
Disney would have said ""it's a small world after all"", but the global
take on of ISO17799 proves that organizations the planet over are
embracing it with enthusiasm.To illustrate the global nature of the standard, we recently created a
table from the last 500 purchases of the standard from the ISO17799
Electronic Shop (www.iso17799.net). The figures below do come with a
serious health warning though - the Electronic Shop is a credit card
purchase system. Some cultures are not as comfortable or familiar as
others with credit card purchase and will therefore have their purchase
position significantly understated. An example is India, which acquires
substantial numbers of the standard, only two of which show in the last
500 from the download location.That aside, the table makes interesting reading:Argentina 1

STRANGER DANGER
=======
As you read this article, look around at your working environment. The
items/information you have to hand may not seem very sensitive because
you deal with them every day... but now look again.If you were alone and not a member of staff, how would you view them?
What would you find if you looked around? Picture yourself as a visitor
passing through. What can you hear in terms of conversation? What can
you see?The chances are that you can hear and see quite a lot that you would not
want to be openly disclosed to the outside world. If this is the case,
the security of your information is at risk potentially from every
visitor, stranger, subcontractor, etc. This article is not written with the intention of discrediting visitors,
but nonetheless, it is important to be fully AWARE of what CAN happen if
due caution is not exercised.The following guidelines may help in ensuring that the risks are
minimized:* Your reception/visitor area should issue distinctive badges and ensure
that visitors wear them* Consider using different colored badges for each day of the week.* Challenge those who are not displaying any identity badges* If your location issues identity badges - make sure YOU wear yours* Do not be afraid to ask someone who they are visiting and what they
are doing* Do not be lazy... escort visitors from reception (if applicable)...
don't let them make their way to you* Do not hold doors open for people not displaying their ID* Do not leave visitors alone   ISO17799 - MORE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=====================1) How many controls are there in the standard?
Part 1 is organized into 10 sections. There are 127 main controls and
over 500 detailed controls in total.2) What is part 2?
Part 2 basically explains how to apply the standard itself, and how to
build and operate an information security management system.3) How old is it?
The standard stems from an original publication in 1993, from the DTI in
the UK. It became BS7799 in 1995 and of course ISO17799 in 2000.4) What is accreditation?
An accreditation body can authorize others to ""certify"" third parties
under the standard (p2). A number of accreditation bodies exist in
different countries.5) Is certification for life?
No. It is normally for three year periods.6) ISO17799 is used throughout the world, but was it internationally
created? Yes indeed. The latest versions included input from
representatives from many nations, including Australia, Brazil, Germany,
Norway, UK and USA, amongst others.7) Is it linked to a specific national legal system?
No. It is generic in terms of legislation.CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS: MINIMIZE THE RISKS
======================The use of credit and debit cards to purchase goods and services has
become an everyday convenience that we take for granted, but there are
associated information security risks which we should pause to consider,
especially when making payments over the Internet.  Web sites are becoming an increasingly popular means of purchasing goods
and services, but they have also become popular targets for cyber
criminals, who often use stolen credit card numbers to purchase goods,
which can then be easily exchanged for cash.  There are also relatively
simple technologies now readily available which could be used by hackers
to surreptitiously steal vast amounts of money, a few pounds at a time,
from millions of people. A survey by the IT research company Gartner
(http://www.gartner.com) predicted that Internet crime involving the
""mass victimization"" of consumers could take place by the end of this
year.  We recommend the following best practice guidelines to minimize the
risks involved in credit card transactions:* Ensure that credit cards used to purchase goods or services on the
Internet have a low credit limit, or if debit cards are used, that they
have limited funds and are only topped up to cover specific Internet
purchases.* All expenses incurred through Internet transactions should be
carefully audited on a regular basis for any anomalies.* Only enter credit card details on a Web site if you are confident as
to its authenticity and that the connection is secure - the prefix https
(as opposed to the usual http) in the Web Site address indicates a
secure connection.* If the security of a Web site is in doubt, any confidential
information posted to it may be exposed to malicious intent.  Be
extremely cautious when posting confidential details on any site where
the Internet Service Provider hosting the site is not verified. Note
that we have pre-checked all sites referenced in this newsletter for
security!* If ordering by telephone using a credit card, ensure that you are
talking to the correct person.  If you are unsure whether the
organization you are dealing with will handle your details sensitively,
pay by some other means.* Lost or stolen credit card details may be used for Internet
transactions.  Inform the card issuer and relevant person within your
organization immediately if a company credit card is lost or stolen.BSI - CERTIFICATIONS

===============
Business continuity planning is covered by section 11 of the standard, a
core requirement of which is the creation and maintenance of a business
continuity plan.Creating such a plan from scratch is a difficult undertaking of course.
This is one reason why software products were produced. Unfortunately
these often become problematic in themselves... difficult to learn,
expensive, etc.Recent times have therefore seen a move to simplification, with
organizations keen to avoid adding complexity to an already complex
task. At the vanguard of this change was a product developed entirely in
MS-Word: The BCP Generator.This was designed from top down to simplify business continuity
planning. It comprises two components: a plan template and an
interactive guide (the latter using Word macros to jump to and fro into
the correct part of the template). It's impact upon the business
continuity scene has been substantial, with organizations from the very
largest to the smallest embracing the tool and its concepts. It is in
active use in over 40 countries.
  
With this change of emphasis in the business continuity planning market,
there is now NO excuse for not creating a full recovery plan. The old
lines of ""too expensive"" and ""too difficult"" are now less hollow than
they ever were. Although section 11 is very clear with respect to the
need of a comprehensive plan, it is surely also a matter of due
diligence to have one, and equally, irresponsibility not to have one.For information on the BCP Generator see: 
http://www.disaster-recovery-plan.comFor information on business continuity generally, see:
http://www.yourwindow.to/business-continuity/ IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE....COULD IT?
==================Every issue of The ISO17799 Newsletter features at least one TRUE story
of an information security breach and its consequences. Again, in this
issue, we focus upon 'low tech' but high impact incidents:
1) On 25th October a contract programmer who had once worked for a large
US based bank walked into the 'inner sanctum' of the main building (the
security guards remembered him as someone permitted to do so). In the
dealing room he claimed to be conducting a quality audit and
interrogated a junior employee and watched a program run - noting down
security codes as they were entered. He then left and hung around
outside until just after normal trading time.He then rang the Bank from a public phone box and initiated an
electronic funds transfer using the codes... $10.2m to a Swiss account. The plan nearly failed when he found that he had noted one of the codes
incorrectly, but he rang the Bank department back and incredibly managed
to trick a different employee into revealing the correct digit.He flew to Switzerland and later returned with the money. He was caught
simply because he couldn't resist boasting about his great feat. When
the police contacted the bank they were still totally unaware of their
loss!
2) Remote, or dial-in access can be a real Achilles heel if not properly
controlled. In a recent case a young hacker gained access to a major
company's system by using the default password of a system engineer
(which had never been changed!). This gave him considerable scope and powers of access. To cover for
himself, however, he semi-disabled the machine log, changed a number of
user passwords, created several fictitious privileged users and tampered
with the dial back system.Getting more ambitious he established a communication link with another
computer and ended up making it crash. All this took place over a couple
of evenings.To recover from the havoc the installation had to close down its prime
computer and restore from the previous weeks back-up, at considerable
cost.
3) Over a period of nine months, the number of computer malfunctions
within a large company had risen from an average of two per year to
critical levels. The impact was such that the business fell behind with
its invoicing systems and had to buy processing and backup from third
parties. As it could not deliver some of its services reliably, it
started to lose the confidence of its customers. The situation began to
spiral. Eventually, the company suspected foul play may be involved and called
the police. Secret surveillance equipment was installed to monitor
staff. One was filmed lightly scratching circuit boards in disk units
and also attaching paper clips to them. Both these actions led to a
short circuit.When confronted, he confessed everything. His motive was to earn
overtime, which was required to process the overlap work which was
delayed by the malfunction. He netted 689 UKP over the 9 months. The
company lost at least 500,000 UKP.   CONTRIBUTIONS

RealNetworks Poses Challenge to Microsoft
By JOHN MARKOFFSAN FRANCISCO, July 21 -- In a significant challenge to Microsoft,
RealNetworks plans to announce a new version of its software on Monday
that can distribute audio and video in a range of formats, including
Microsoft's own proprietary Windows Media.The new software is intended for large media companies and other
corporations that need to send audio and video data to customers and
employees in a variety of different formats. But RealNetworks
acknowledged that it was possible that the company might incur
Microsoft's legal wrath.Nevertheless, Rob Glaser, a former Microsoft executive who founded
RealNetworks as Progressive Networks in 1994, said he believed the
strategy was good for both Microsoft and consumers.""A rational way for them to respond would be to say, `This is great,' ""
he said. ""That would be Microsoft of the future.""Mr. Glaser said his company, based in Seattle, had developed a version
of the Microsoft Media Server software that comes with the Windows
operating system.He said RealNetworks' engineers had studied the data that was sent
between the Microsoft media server software and the Windows Media Player
program and recreated the technology needed to play files in the
Microsoft format. This method created a so-called clean-room version,
meaning the developers built the transmission software without any
knowledge about the underlying program.Microsoft has adopted a similar strategy at several junctures,
Mr. Glaser said, reverse-engineering technologies like NetWare,
PostScript and JavaScript at different times.Microsoft executives said the company currently licensed the Windows
Media Player technology to a variety of companies including Yahoo,
RealNetworks and the America Online unit of AOL Time Warner. But a
Microsoft executive said that a clean-room copy of the Windows server
technology could lead to quality and performance issues.""It's kind of hard to speculate about the technology until we see it,""
said Dave Fester, the general manager of the Windows Media division. If
a company has not licensed the server software, he added, ""we would need
to look at it and see what they're doing.""RealNetworks appears to be endeavoring to avoid being ""Netscaped,"" a
reference to the fate that befell the Netscape Communications
Corporation when Microsoft decided to make an Internet browser, which
was pioneered commercially by Netscape, a standard part of the Windows
operating system. Netscape was later acquired by AOL Time
Warner. Microsoft's decision to build an Internet browser into Windows
and give it away at no additional cost led directly to a bitter
antitrust lawsuit brought by the Justice Department in 1997.RealNetworks, which was a pioneer in the market for streaming media to
desktop personal computers, has been under growing pressure from
Microsoft, which is giving away both the server and Windows Media Player
program as part of its operating strategy. RealNetworks also faces
challenges from Apple Computer, which offers the QuickTime media player
as a part of its Macintosh OS X operating system and sells a more
full-featured player.Moreover, in recent months Macromedia Inc., which makes the Flash
animation software used on many Web sites, has added video capabilities
to its technology, making it a potential rival.RealNetworks is gambling that with a proliferation of different
standards and formats for video and audio, the media corporations that
make content available over the Internet will flock to a single system
that supports multiple types of data. The company is trying to shift the
focus of the competition from the PC desktop to the server, according to
analysts.Several analysts said the RealNetworks shift in strategy could put
Microsoft on the defensive.""Real has got the experience and sophistication to pull this off,"" said
Richard Doherty, the president of Envisioneering, a market research and
consulting firm based in Seaford, N.Y. ""It will open up a new horse race.""Until now the companies have been engaged in a technology war to rapidly
increase the power and quality of each of their media players. At the
same time, they have competed over which of the programs are placed on
the desktops of personal computer users. RealNetworks claims to have
700,000 subscribers for pay services, but it is perceived as being
increasingly vulnerable, according to some analysts, because Microsoft
has included its Media Player as part of the Windows operating system,
which dominates the PC market.There are dozens of data formats for playing audio and video on the
Internet, but the dominant ones are RealAudio and RealVideo from
RealNetworks, QuickTime from Apple, Windows Media from Microsoft and the
industry digital movie standards MPEG-2 and MPEG-4.Microsoft and RealNetworks are currently locked in a close race for
desktop media player leadership. In the first quarter of this year,
according to survey data collected by Jupiter Research, a market
research firm based in New York, RealNetworks' RealOne Player had a 29.1
percent share of media players, while Microsoft's Windows Media Player
had a 28.2 percent share. Apple's Quicktime player was third, with a
12.2 percent.The new server software from RealNetworks is part of a version of the
company's media server that is to be introduced on Monday and which will
be called the Helix Universal Server. RealNetworks said it would offer
performance data based on a test it financed at an independent testing
service, KeyLabs, that indicate that the Helix software can, under some
conditions, deliver up to four times the speed of the Windows Media
Server in Microsoft's operating system. (Software servers are programs
that run on powerful computers and can send streams of digital
information to many computer users simultaneously.)At a news conference scheduled to be held in San Francisco, RealNetworks
is also expected to announce that it plans to make the Helix software
available as part of a strategy known as community source, which will
make it possible for RealNetworks partners and competitors to take
advantage of the original programmers' instructions.RealNetworks is to announce a range of partners, including Hitachi,
Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Deutsche Telekom, NEC, Nokia, Cisco Systems,
Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Palm, Texas Instruments and others. These
partners could then incorporate the software into their own hardware and
software products.Under the licensing strategy, companies will be able to freely gain
access to the underlying code that the Helix program is based on, but
they will still pay a licensing fee when they sell commercial products
based on the technology.The community-source approach to software, which was pioneered by Sun to
distribute its Java programming language, is a variation upon the
original free software or open-source approach which has confounded the
software industry in recent years.While open-source software can be freely shared, with some restrictions,
the community-source approach is more restrictive and yet still tries to
persuade others to collaborate and add innovative ideas.Other large technology companies including Sun, I.B.M. and Apple, have
all now adopted variations on such open-source strategy, with varying
results. In Sun's case, the company has been criticized because, while
Java has become an industry standard, the company has not been the
principal financial beneficiary in many cases.RealNetworks is trying to strike a balance between opening up its
technology to persuade others to participate and innovate and not losing
control of the technology entirely, Mr. Glaser said. ""We think we've
struck the balance well,"" he said.Analysts said the strategy shift by RealNetworks was likely to shake up
the industry. ""The moment you've open-sourced something you've cornered
your competitor,"" said Matthew Berk, an analyst a Jupiter Research. ""To
date this stuff has been very proprietary. Opening it up makes it
accessible to creative and gifted programmers who will come up with wild
stuff that the companies have never considered.""Mr. Glaser said he expected other companies to produce technology that
would rival RealNetworks' commercially as a result of the
community-source strategy.One possibility is that companies such as Sun or I.B.M. could decide to
add the Helix technology of RealNetworks as a standard component of
their operating systems. Although RealNetworks might not get a
significant financial benefit from such an arrangement it could
contribute to making its Helix software a de facto industry standard.Mr. Glaser said he had struck upon the idea of making his media server
software open source while visiting with an executive from Nokia, the
world's largest cellphone maker.""Taking all of this stuff beyond the PC has been a huge motivation for
us,"" he said. When he realized that Nokia was interested in deploying
the software technology on as many as 30 to 40 different types of
phones, he realized that RealNetworks did not have enough programming
talent to support the effort.""I told him, `I don't think we have enough engineers even if you guys
were willing to pay us,' "" he said.That touched off a search for an alternative way of having the two
companies cooperate.http://quicken.com.com/2100-1023-945406.htmlReal takes the open-source route 
By Jim Hu 
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
July 22, 2002, 1:55 PM PTRealNetworks on Monday unveiled a new open-source version of its
streaming media technology that supports multiple file formats for audio
and video, including those that use Microsoft's Windows Media technology. The new campaign, dubbed ""Helix,"" and first reported by The New York
Times, marks one of the most ambitious moves in the company's
history. RealNetworks is simultaneously releasing technology without
permission that plugs in to Microsoft's competing software and is
raising the hood on much of its own software technology to ""open source""
developers or anyone else who wants to look. The twin moves raise the risk of lawsuits and renewed competition --
potentially even from Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft itself, once it
gets a look under the hood at RealNetworks' technology. But it marks a
dramatic, potential way for a company watching its market share diminish
to regain momentum and support across an industry where many other
players remain skeptical of Microsoft's power.""It's a very bold move on the part of Real,"" said Michael Gartenberg, a
research director for analyst firm Jupiter Research. ""This was a shot
fired by Real and fired directly at Redmond."" The move is the latest in a series of strategic twists and turns that
has made RealNetworks one of the only companies to survive direct
Microsoft competition for years. While the company has expanded into
paid subscription content business, its software and streaming media
infrastructures have been under increasing pressure from Microsoft,
which has deemed multimedia to be one of the major drives under the
latest versions of its Windows operating system. Real's Helix announcement mainly involves the technology that allows
media files to move from place to place over the Internet. RealNetworks
and Microsoft both produce servers that allow video and audio to be
streamed from a content company such as CNN or NBC to a personal
computer. Real has charged for this software, while Microsoft has given
it away for free. In April, RealMedia reached 17 million at-home viewers, compared with
Windows Media at 15.1 million and Apple Computer's QuickTime at 7.3
million, according to Nielsen/NetRatings. At work, Windows Media drew
about 12.2 million unique viewers, compared with RealMedia's 11.6
million and QuickTime's 5 million. Real's own new product, called the Universal Server, will allow one
server to stream Real's technology, Microsoft files, Apple Computer's
QuickTime, and others. Most other competing products do not support
competitors' technology. ""When you have all these different platforms, and all these different
protocols, it gets unmanageable,"" RealNetworks' Rob Glaser said at a
high-glitz press conference in San Francisco announcing the product. ""A
lot of what (this technology) is about is breaking those bottlenecks and
making convergence really converge."" To make the new product compatible with Microsoft files, however, the
company pursued a risky strategy known as ""reverse engineering,"" in
which developers examine a competitor's product to see how it works and
try to create something that works just like it. Glaser said that engineers worked entirely in a ""clean room""
environment, meaning that they had no access to actual Microsoft
code. Had they simply copied code, they could be liable for patent
infringement. The resulting product simply mimics the way that
Microsoft's files are sent across networks and allows a Windows Media
player to receive the file. Other companies have been sued for simply copying a competitor's code
and putting it in their own products. But RealNetworks says it's not
worried about Microsoft lawsuits, because it took precautions to do all
development in the ""clean room"" environment. Microsoft itself has
engaged in this kind of legal reverse engineering. Analysts say Microsoft, which still faces antitrust lawsuits, is in no
position to sue in any case. ""This is a very tenuous time for Microsoft,"" Gartenberg said. ""This is
not a time in Microsoft's history when it can be seen as trying to do to
Real what it did to Netscape."" The influential giant?Certainly, Monday's announcement acknowledges Microsoft's influence in
media technology, something Glaser and Real have often been loathe to do. Microsoft was quick to spin Monday's announcement as further validation
of its strength in the marketplace. ""It's an admission of RealNetworks that it's important for them to
support Windows Media and that we're now the leading player among home
and work users,"" said Michael Aldridge, lead product manager for
Microsoft's Windows Digital Media division. Aldridge added that RealNetworks currently has a licensing agreement for
its media player to support Windows audio and video formats. However,
RealNetworks and Microsoft do not have an agreement to allow the server
to deliver Windows Media formats to end users, which is what
RealNetworks trying to do. Aldridge declined to comment on RealNetworks' replication of Microsoft's
technology. In addition to its own new product, Real has promised to give away
source code to much of the underlying technology for streaming
media. That stops short of the actual file format, or ""codec"" itself,
but will provide the open-source community and other companies with
powerful new tools to build their own streaming media players or
software. Glaser said he wouldn't initially make the software code that mimics
Microsoft's streaming available but that he was considering the idea. A
first chunk of code underlying the RealNetworks multimedia player
software will be released in 90 days. Other code, including the basic
functions of its streaming media server and encoder, will be released by
the end of the year, the company said. The company's plan to reveal its source code--the basic instructions
underlying the software--echoes similar moves made by Netscape
Communications to defend against Microsoft. In March 1998, Netscape took
the bold step of opening its source code to allow software developers to
help create the next generation of its popular browser. James Barksdale, then CEO of Netscape, said the move would allow the
company to ""tap into a virtually unlimited developer talent pool.""
Instead, the effort, which has evolved into the Mozilla.org project, hit
considerable roadblocks, and Microsoft overtook Netscape in market
share. ----

The problem with SOAP is that it tries to escape from the Web interface.
It deliberately attempts to suck, mostly because it is deliberately
trying to supplant CGI-like applications rather than Web-like
applications.  It is simply a waste of time for folks to say that ""HTTP
allows this because I've seen it used by this common CGI script.""  If we
thought that sucky CGI scripts were the basis for good Web
architectures, then we wouldn't have needed a Gateway Interface to
implement them.  In order for SOAP-ng to succeed as a Web protocol, it
needs to start behaving like it is part of the Web.  That means, among
other things, that it should stop trying to encapsulate all sorts of
actions under an object-specific interface.  It needs to limit its
object-specific behavior to those situations in which object-specific
behavior is actually desirable.  If it does not do so, then it is not
using URI as the basis for resource identification, and therefore it is
no more part of the Web than SMTP.

"What's wrong with doing business over the Web?  Web forms.  There's
promising replacements forms, but this is the current state of the
industry: o You find something that you want to fill out.  It's a partnership form,
   a signup for a Web seminar, a request for more information, anything.
 o You start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend
   about 10 minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops
   just to get a small piece of information , whitepaper, or a callback
   when halfway through, you start to wonder if it's really worth your
   time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list. 
 o Pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized.
   I was on a site just now that had every single country in the world
   listed; the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you
   to hit submit, but due to the layout, the ""more>"" tag on the second
   row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except
   about two dozen third world countries. 
 o Even worse, ever time you hit submit, all forms based things complain
   about using the universal country phone number format and will cause
   you to re-enter dashes instead of dots.
 o When you get something that's not entered right, you will go back and
   enter it right, but then some other field or most likely pulldown will
   automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to
   go back and resent that freaking thing too.  Finally after all combinations
   of all pulldowns, you may get a successful submit.
 o You wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation.  
 o Sometimes, like today, you won't be able to ever submit anything due
   to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that
   is internally non-conflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their
   forms submission.What's wrong with this picture?  The company is screwing you by wasting
your time enforcing their data collection standards on you.  I'm sure there's
someone in that company that would be willing to accept ""US"", ""U.S"", ""USA""
""United States"", ""U of A"", ""America"", etc. and would know exactly which
freaking country the interested party was from instead of forcing them
to waste even more time playing Web form geography.  I'm starting to see the light of Passport.  You want more information?  Hit
this passport button.  Voila.  IE6 and Netscape 6,7 have pre-forms sutff,
but I always turn it off because you never know when there's that one field
that you don't want to submit to the person you are submitting to that 
automatically gets sent, i.e. the privacy stuff is well beyond the 
average user who will get screwed on privacy stuff.  So, if crappy forms-based submission is the state of practice for
business enablement on the Web, I can't see this whole data submission
and hurry up and wait for us to get back to you business process as
working all that well.

spamtrap, unless it's a Bugtraq message, in which case I revoke it as that 
account (not as the spamtrap). I'm talking about the situation before I 
checked for Bugtraq in the procmailrc. The message was sent to the spamtrap

it was erroneously reported. The spamtrap is not, and never was, subscribed

""differentiation"".Since most Linux vendors are businesses, they need to make money to
survive[1]. To make money they need to sell products. To ensure they sell
their product, they must provide something that other vendors do not.The down side is that this produces many variations of the same product. The
benefit of open source is that there is a common standard which everyone can
share. (The up side is that the competition drives the different
organisations to constantly improve their product offering[2].)So unlike SunOS vs AIX vs HPUX vs Tru64, where the API's and available
functionality were often starkly different, Linux distributions are mostly
the same.While I may have to look in /var/named on Red Hat, and /etc/bind on Debian,
the binaries are basically the same, as are the man pages. In most cases,
doing a ""man named"" will reveal the compiled location of the config files.
So long as this is understood, it is easy enough to administer most Linux
distributions.I expect that as companies and public sector organisations begin to
understand the open source paradigm, you will find even more distributions
appearing. The reason I believe this is that deriving a new distribution
from, say, Debian requires comparatively little effort. I would see this
requiring slightly more effort than the amount of time many enterprise
admins spend trying to customise the desktops, screen savers and software

make oodles of profits and screw the little man to survive."" This discussion
is beyond the scope of this list. :)[2] The often overlooked problem with competition is that it weakens the
""combatants"", leaving the field open for a less powerful force to take over
and entrench its position (in this case I would be referring to Microsoft).
However, I do not believe this will effect the Linux movement as all the
vendors are obliged to work together to a great degree, thanks to the GPL.__________________________________________________

"workshop on embodied conversational characters the first workshop on embodied conversational characters granlibakken resort & conference center at lake tahoe tahoe city ( north shore ) california , usa october 12-15 , 1998 with the support of aaai cooperation of acm / sigchi call for papers recent advances in several core software technologies have made possible a new type of human-computer interface : the conversational character . conversational characters are autonomous , anthropomorphic , animated figures that have the ability to communicate through multiple modalities , including spoken language , facial expressions , and gestures . unlike textual natural language interfaces , conversational characters have the ability to perceive and produce the verbal and non-verbal signals that identify discourse structure and regulate the flow of information between interlocutors . such signals include intonational patterns , gestures , back-channel feedback signals , and turn-taking protocols . these capabilities enable them to engage in complex interactions with human users via natural speech rather than complex command languages , menus or graphical manipulations . research on conversational characters has emerged from a number of disciplines , including , among others , artificial intelligence , computational linguistics , computer animation , computer vision , psychology , cognitive science , virtual reality , cscw , and hci . this diversity is naturally reflected in the broad range of active research areas in conversational character interfaces . the primary goal of this workshop is to advance the state of conversational character research and development by identifying novel approaches to the topics and issues listed below , and integrating them into a framework for embodied , conversational human-computer interaction . selected contributors will be invited to expand and refine their papers for inclusion in a book to be published by addison - wesley . the aims of this book will be to introduce , define , and advance the field ; to give a snapshot of current work in it ; and to suggest future challenges and opportunities . particular topics of interest include , but are not limited to : * multi - modal interaction * autonomy * recognition & perception of speech , * behavior / dialogue planning gesture , facial expressions , etc . * distribution of semantic information * reactivity and opportunism across multiple modalities * rendering techniques * representation * semantic representations for * character individuation non-verbal communication * dialogue planning * affect and personality * turn - taking and back-channel signals * user studies * spoken language processing * tools for character * discourse structure building / authoring * intonation * architectures & applications papers should address one or more of these topics . demonstrations and video presentations of working systems are strongly encouraged . format the two and a half-day workshop will include several paper sessions , organized around emerging themes , with follow-up panel discussions . in addition , there will be a demonstration session for authors to present working systems . attendance attendance will be limited to 35-40 people . preference will be given to authors whose papers have been selected for presentation at the workshop . submission requirements paper submissions are due on june 15 , 1998 , and should be no longer than 6 pages ( 10-12 point font ) . upon acceptance , authors will be given the opportunity to expand their papers to 8-10 pages . electronic submissions in postscript or microsoft word formats are preferred , and should be sent to prevost @ pal . xerox . com . otherwise , send four hardcopies to : scott prevost attn : embodied conversational characters workshop fx palo alto laboratory 3400 hillview avenue , bldg . 4 palo alto , ca 94304 voice : 650 / 813-7701 deadlines submissions due june 15th notification of acceptance august 17th final papers due september 14th workshop october 12th - 15th workshop organizers joseph w . sullivan , fx palo alto lab , usa ( sullivan @ pal . xerox . com ) justine cassell , mit media laboratory , usa ( justine @ media . mit . edu ) workshop program committee committee co - chairs : scott prevost , fx palo alto lab , usa ( prevost @ pal . xerox . com ) elizabeth churchill , fx palo alto lab , usa ( churchill @ pal . xerox . com ) committee members : elisabeth andre , dfki gmbh , germany ( elisabeth . andre @ dfki . de ) gene ball , microsoft research , usa ( geneb @ microsoft . com ) phil cohen , oregon graduate institute , usa ( pcohen @ cse . ogi . edu ) barbara hayes - roth , stanford univ . , usa ( hayes-roth @ cs . stanford . edu ) kenji mase , atr international , japan ( mase @ mic . atr . co . jp ) clifford nass , stanford university , usa ( nass @ leland . stanford . edu ) mark steedman , university of pennsylvania , usa ( steedman @ cis . upenn . edu ) kris thorisson , lego a / s , denmark ( kris @ digi . lego . com ) demos chair : timothy bickmore , isii inc . , usa ( bickmore @ pal . xerox . com ) additional information for more information , please consult the workshop web page : www . fxpal . com / wecc98 /",Safe Email

"query : preserving field recordings i have a question about preserving regular * analog * recordings made in the field . i work in rural chinese , and for the most part i collect inventories of lexicon , along with some texts . for ordinary background recording of interviews i have been using a $ 45 panasonic microcassette recorder on half-speed , which does * quite * serviceably even without an external mic . i intend to use ordinary high-bias non-metal cassettes for material i want to work with in some detail , such as stories , conversations , and recitation . i can transfer that to micro-cassette for transcription , so that the master remains in good condition . what concerns me is finding a way to preserve material originally made on analog tape . tapes mildew rapidly in taiwan and southern china , and even in seattle and new york i have had tapes become unplayable after a number of years in storage . i was thinking that if there were some inexpensive and painless way to digitize ordinary analog tapes , i could transfer them to cd here at my school , for only the price of the cd itself ( about $ 12 ) . one problem is wasted space : i can only fit 74 minutes of uncompressed sound on a cd , because one seems to have no choice but to record in stereo , even if the original source is mono . does anyone have any experience with this ? i could get far more material onto a cd if i compressed it but i do n't want to do that , because i have no confidence that today 's compression protocols will be readable in 20 or 50 years - remember the data from the 1960 us census , which was stored on magnetic tape and could no longer be read by the mid - 1980 's ? if something is important enough to preserve on cd , i do n't want it to become unreadable in a few decades . i 'd appreciate hearing any ideas on long-term storage . also , if anyone has ideas about why digital equipment might still be preferable for my work , i 'd like to hear them . i will summarize the responses i get . sincerely , david prager branner , yuen ren society asian l&l , do-21 , university of washington seattle , wa 98195 usa < charmii @ u . washington . edu > web : http : / / weber . u . washington . edu / ~ yuenren / circular . html",Safe Email

Polite and respectful protest is acceptable then. No dumping tea in the 
harbour or anything like that.
I think the primary purpose of loud and rowdy protests is to get on 
television, and that the tactics can be
justified as a reaction to a systematic removal of alternative 
viewpoints from that medium. On the other hand,
it was a priceless TV moment. There was nothing resembling assault, and 
the protestors were not in anybody's face
(at least in my understanding of the vernacular).And no, being rude and disrespectful is not the way to influence 
politicians, but the standard way of using lobbyists and
writing checks is beyond many of us.Owen",Safe Email

( vnbl . ob ) is a holding company , which is identifying and acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services to provide long term growth for its shareholders . vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in the security sector is unprecedented . the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2 ool have changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in the banking , healthcare and government sectors . while the focus for vinoble is on north america , the opportunity for security services is worldwide . according to giga , a wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by 2 oo 5 . vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security market by delivering professional services , security products , security training , and managed security services . in pursuit of this objective , vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals offering a full range of security services . through vinoble ' s consulting services and integrated delivery solutions , vinoble will help organizations protect key assets including persons , property , information , brand , and reputation . homeland security , the national strategy for a secure cyberspace , the healthcare insurance portability and accountability act ( hipaa ) , sarbanes - oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued increase in security demands in the united states and abroad . vinoble intends to position itself as the ' most desired ' provider of , both , physical and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients , alliance partners , and peers . we will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are the most knowledgeable , agile , professional , and cost - conscious provider of ' tailored ' security solutions to meet the unique needs of each client . management has partnered with garcyco capital corp . ( "" gccc "" ) to assist in finding acquisition candidates for the company , structuring such acquisitions , and effecting a transition to corporate growth . at present , vinoble and gccc have targeted several companies as potential acquisition candidates . pending the outcome of due diligence and audits , the company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis required for listing on a national exchange . here is recent news on the company : malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - may 2 o , 2 oo 5 - - vinoble , inc .

an internal procession unit around 4MHz.  Can we consider them as trusted 
hardware ?  The ability to ship smart cards periodicaly uppon cashing of a 
monthly subscription fee would not raise too much the cost of ""renting"" the 
system.  Smart card do their own self encryption.  Can they be used to 
decrypt data needed by the system ?  The input of the system could me mangled 
and the would keep a reference of how long it was in service.This sounds really feasible but I may be totaly wrong.  I may also be wrong 
about the safety of a smart card.  What do you think ?--

"" the enron spokesman said yesterday that the company ' s trading partners are doing business with enron on "" essentially the same terms "" as they have in the past . "" there has been no significant change in the credit conditions , "" he said . trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from enron would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant ' s finances . the banks involved in the current negotiations , including j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . , are asking enron for stricter covenants on the new credit line than they had asked for in the past , one official said . bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to show the investment community that enron can meet its commitments . "" confidence in this company was lost , "" said one bank official involved in the negotiations for a new credit line . "" but confidence will be restored .

' ' the board is meeting frequently and will announce any actions when appropriate , ' ' an enron spokesman said . two weeks ago , enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was ousted last week . the company also disclosed about $ 1 billion in separate write - offs , and it said last week that the securities and exchange commission had made an inquiry into its financial accounting . enron hopes to maintain its investment - grade credit rating , which is crucial to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it . lately , enron ' s bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds , and two major credit - rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the company ' s rating . copyright ? 2000 dow jones oct 29 , 2001 by agencies : agency material and elizabeth wine enron shares plunged 40 per cent in the last week , doing severe damage to mutual funds , the company ' s largest institutional ownership bloc , and the havoc may continue . more than 15 per cent of the 4 , 000 us equity funds held shares in the embattled company ' s shares as of the most recent reporting period , according to fund tracker morningstar . mutual funds held a fifth of enron ' s shares , but that percentage is likely to be much lower now , say fund analysts , who suggest much of the stock ' s halving in october is due to large sales by institutional holders . janus , the growth fund specialist , was the largest institutional shareholder according to the most recent filings , dated june 30 , with more than 42 m shares representing a stake worth dollars 2 . 1 bn . the stake - if still held in its entirety - would be worth dollars 659 m at friday ' s closing price of dollars 15 . 40 . enron shares dropped 95 cents , or 5 . 81 per cent on friday , taking its total fall to nearly 41 per cent last week on concerns over accounting questions and some limited partnerships created by andrew fastow , former chief financial officer . on friday , several leading rating agencies put the company ' s debt on credit watches , and enron bond prices plunged . the company ' s stock is down 81 per cent since january . most fund managers , including those at janus , refuse to discuss a company in which they are actively trading . however , several mutual fund groups with large enron stakes have said their listed positions are "" dated "" , implying that the funds ' positions in the company have changed . morningstar analyst christine benz , who follows the janus funds , said managers of the group ' s larger funds had been "" lightening up "" their enron holdings this year . she said blaine rollins , who manages the dollars 23 bn flagship janus fund , said that in september he had sold some of his stake - listed as 2 . 15 per cent of outstanding shares as of april 30 - but did not say when . ken zschappel , manager of the dollars 11 bn aim constellation fund , also declined to discuss his holdings , listed as 0 . 27 per cent of outstanding shares as of march 31 . but aim said the position had since been "" trimmed substantially "" . other top fund owners , as of the most recent filings , included the alliance premier growth fund , the janus twenty , janus mercury and janus growth & income funds , fidelity magellan , axp new dimensions fund , putnam investors , putnam voyager and putnam new opportunities funds and morgan stanley dividend growth fund . copyright : the financial times limited comment & analysis - enron flickers . by simon london and sheila mcnulty . 10 / 29 / 2001 financial times ( c ) 2001 financial times limited . all rights reserved comment & analysis - enron flickers - once a paragon of the new economy , the us energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free - wheeling management , write simon london and sheila mcnulty . enron has some explaining to do . for the past decade or more , the texas - based company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school professors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast - growing energy trader . now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind . its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year . the us securities and exchange commission is investigating multi - million dollar deals with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial officer , which resulted in a $ 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholders ' equity . a hastily - convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions as it answered about these "" related - party transactions "" . the departure of andy fastow , the aforementioned cfo , soon followed . with its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies , enron has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines . yesterday if confirmed it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity . "" this marks the end of enron ' s walk on the wild side , "" observes curt launer , an analyst with credit suisse first boston , the investment bank . on the surface , events at enron can be explained by the combination of deteriorating trading conditions , a complex capital structure and poor investor relations . but the root causes go back further . the entrepreneurial culture and dynamic management that fuelled enron ' s growth in the 1990 s appear to have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis . therein may lie a cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle "" new economy "" magic on to old economy companies . enron ' s transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of jeffrey skilling , who was hired from mckinsey , the management consulting firm , to develop energy trading . for the previous decade enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulating us energy markets under the guidance of kenneth lay , a former deputy under - secretary of energy . mr lay remains chairman . but it was mr skilling who spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supplying it . the two sides of the business - trading and generation / supply - have always been strange bedfellows . the former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more likely to be found on wall street than in a utility . mr skilling ' s answer in the early 1990 s was to bring in talent from outside the company . one of his first recruits was mr fastow , an expert in securitisation , the repackaging of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets . the energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself . a management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice - president , director , manager and associate / analyst - much like a consulting firm . employees were free to take as much holiday as they liked , so long as they delivered results . as one of mr skilling ' s early recruits recalled : "" it was all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules . "" the seemingly free - wheeling style was based on a "" loose - tight "" management model expounded by tom peters and bob waterman , the management writers and mckinsey alumni . at enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy business were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in existing markets . up - and - coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory . louise kitchen , the 32 - year - old british executive who was the creative force behind enron online , the group ' s internet - based trading platform , changed jobs or was promoted seven times in five years . balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of risk , legal commitments , finance and performance evaluation / remuneration . mr skilling once described the approach in this way : "" as long as you clear your deals or business ideas through those screens , you can do whatever you want around here . "" this approach did deliver growth and innovation . as well as making markets in its core energy products , enron now trades everything from weather derivatives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable climatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals . the success of enron online allows the group to describe itself as the world ' s leading e - commerce company . it has also started marketing electricity to us consumers through a joint venture with international business machines and america online , the internet service provider . in february this year mr skilling got his reward : he became chief executive of a group ranked seventh in fortune magazine ' s list of the 500 most powerful us corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as ibm , at & t , bank of america and boeing . in retrospect , however , this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was achieved at a price . first was the personal cost to mr skilling . in august he abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job . personal , non - health related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explanation . a second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity . in order to avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded , enron used a range of off - balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion . ljm , the private equity fund in which mr fastow played a role , is just one of a cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to enron ' s accounts . other financing vehicles include osprey , marlin , whitewing , atlantic water trust and azurix . "" they went after too many things too quickly , "" says stephen moore of moody ' s investors service , the credit ratings agency . a third cost , associated with the last , was a loss of financial transparency . the group ' s extensive use of swaps , options and other derivative financial instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have little idea of how enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks to which it is exposed . david fleischer , an analyst at goldman sachs , summed up the views of many investors during last week ' s conference call . he told the group ' s management : "" the company ' s credibility is being severely questioned and there is a need for much more disclosure . there is an appearance that you are hiding something or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be questionable . "" the fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus . "" the problems , in our view , stem from enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core skills , "" argues raymond niles , analyst at salomon smith barney . "" power plants in india , water companies , extension of their franchise to the mass retail market , and using a fibre - optic network to deliver content over the internet are all unrelated , or only tangentially related , to their core merchant energy business . "" enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for some of these ventures . this time last year mr skilling was arguing that enron broadband was a business worth $ 35 bn ( # 24 bn ) in its own right . this helped push the share price to all - time highs - and storing up trouble when trading volumes failed to materialise . "" they over - promised on the new business they created , "" says chris bartlett , a professor at harvard business school and long - time watcher of the company . "" enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with enron online and the broadband business . to some extent they are now paying the price . "" will enron weather the storm ? notwithstanding the risk of further out - of - the - blue financial shocks , most analysts believe that it will . the merchant energy business remains powerful and profitable . mr niles at salomon smith barney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent of earnings and has shown consistent 30 - 40 per cent annual growth over the past three years . assets totalling more than $ 4 bn were also earmarked for disposal before the current crisis erupted , underlining that there is plenty of realisable value within the group ' s portfolio of physical energy assets . and yet the doubts remain . it is , ultimately , a question of confidence and credibility . investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight management methods has tilted too far towards the former . mr lay and his team will have to tighten up .

"" one is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them . and two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth , "" patterson said . as earnings fall and forward earnings guidance is revised downward , some power companies are seeking strategies to address the bleaker environment . and plans to spin off units have been postponed or called off . shares of enron slid $ 1 . 05 , or 6 . 4 percent , to $ 15 . 30 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange on friday . the world has changed aes corp . , a global power producer whose earnings fell for a second consecutive quarter on a poor showing from operations in brazil and britain , said thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off assets . "" it ' s a different place , "" aes ' chief executive officer dennis bakke said of the business climate facing utilities today compared with last year ' s powerful growth . on friday , constellation energy group , parent company of baltimore gas & electric , scrapped plans to split its power generation and trading operations into two company because of economic changes . constellation also hired a new chief executive and severed ties with goldman sachs , which planned to make an equity investment in the company . "" the utility industry and energy markets , and indeed the entire u . s . economy , have changed considerably in the past year . as a combined company , we will be better positioned to seize opportunities to grow and deliver , "" said christian poindexter , constellation ' s chairman . return to traditional values bakke said one prong of aes ' s brave , new world scenario was a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable , long - term contract generation business . it makes sense for power generating companies to sign about 75 percent to 80 percent of their generating capacity into long - term contracts because it provides stability and a level of profitability in a period of flat growth , according to gordon howald , energy analyst with credit lyonnaise . "" calpine does it already , "" he said , referring to the california - based independent power producer that has the lion ' s share of the power it generates contracted out . "" what drove the valuations in all these companies last year was that power markets were very inefficient . physical reserve margins were low . but with flat to down demand in 2001 - as it appears to be the case - there is very little to lead us to believe that power prices will be anywhere near that level , "" he added . howald said with all the new generation coming on , natural gas prices should remain high but power prices should come down further , squeezing spark spreads , or profit margins , for solely gas fired companies . smaller companies also rethink strategies as lower power prices impact earnings , many power companies are turning back to u . s . markets to try to maximize their bottom line . "" earnings for the quarter is not the big deal . the big deal is that for 2002 they are not going to earn as much as people expected . it ' s a downward revision of earnings guidance . "" said patterson . michigan - based cms energy corp . cut its earnings estimates for the second time to $ 2 to $ 2 . 05 for 2002 , down from $ 2 . 79 and said it would sell off certain overseas assets and focus future growth primarily in north america . cms , whose earnings were down for the third quarter , said it took a charge for planned divestitures , south american energy distribution units as well as other international investments . allegheny energy inc . also changed its strategy after reporting a fall in third quarter earnings . the maryland - based company said while it is continuing to work towards getting necessary regulatory approvals for a initial public offering to hold its unregulated assets , it will not proceed with the offering at this time .

' ' but less than a year later , everybody seems to have lost , especially enron ' s investors . enron ' s stock is plunging , and questions about its finances are mounting . some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens , trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted and energy prices could grow more volatile . in a worst - case outlook , enron could become the 2001 version of long - term capital management , the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998 . enron ' s shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year , erasing $ 50 billion in shareholder value . enron closed on friday at $ 15 . 40 , down 95 cents , after hitting a 52 - week low of $ 15 . 04 earlier in the day . the future of electricity deregulation is in doubt , thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in california earlier this year - - a crisis that ended only when that state contradicted deregulation ' s basic tenets by intervening deeply in the power market . enron ' s efforts to become a profit - making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures . in august , mr . skilling quit , forcing kenneth l . lay , his predecessor as chief executive and still enron ' s chairman , to resume day - to - day control of the company . the company declined to make senior executives , including mr . lay , available for comment , and asked that questions be submitted in writing . mr . skilling could not be reached . enron ' s problems boiled over earlier this month , when it disclosed that its shareholders ' equity , a measure of the company ' s value , dropped by $ 1 . 2 billion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in enron ' s regular financial statements . the securities and exchange commission is looking into the company ' s financial reporting , and some investors question whether enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading electricity and natural gas . the slump in the company ' s shares accelerated after enron revealed the fall in its shareholders ' equity . on wednesday , the company forced out its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who is at the center of the controversy over enron ' s confusing finances . the company , which six months ago seemed to be reaping billions of dollars from california ' s energy crisis , today faces a potential cash crunch . the surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors ' smoldering concern about enron ' s opaque financial statements . now , with wall street analysts and bond - rating agencies demanding more information about the complex transactions that have fueled the company ' s profits , enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash . enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash . on thursday , the company drew down a $ 3 . 3 billion credit line it had previously arranged with a group of banks led by citigroup and j . p . morgan chase , which have each extended at least $ 400 million . but because of enron ' s importance in the natural gas and electricity markets , industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide . the supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected even if the company failed , because enron is mainly a trader , rather than a producer , of energy . but a crisis at the company might increase the volatility of energy prices , which have swung wildly in the last year . philip k . verleger jr . , an energy - markets economist , emphasized that he thought enron would survive this crisis . but he said it was not clear what would happen if enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company ' s enrononline internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations . ' ' you suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there - - are they good ? are the firm ' s hedges good ? what ' s the situation ? ' ' mr . verleger said . ' ' it ' s got everyone scared . ' ' in the short run , enron ' s credit rating may be its biggest problem . if the company ' s rating falls below investment grade , enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed . but creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuable , because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the company . a drop in the company ' s credit rating could also prompt other energy traders and producers to back away from doing business with enron , hurting the company ' s sales and profits . enron ' s credit rating stands several notches above the critical point . but its bonds , which are publicly traded , have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost 10 percent , comparable with many junk bonds . two of the three major credit - rating agencies , moody ' s investors service and fitch investors service , have put enron ' s bonds on review for possible downgrades . ' ' the issue that ' s in the front of everybody ' s mind right now is credit , ' ' said mark gurley , senior vice president and general manager for trading at aquila inc . , one of the nation ' s largest energy traders . aquila is based in kansas city , mo . for now , aquila and other major energy traders and producers , including reliant energy , the el paso corporation and dynegy , are continuing to do business with enron . and mr . gurley said that enron ' s own trading in the electricity and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling reminiscent of the collapse of long - term capital management in 1998 . ' ' they haven ' t done anything trading - wise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down , ' ' he said . still , some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefully at transactions with enron , especially long - term contracts . they also said risk - management and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation . mark palmer , an enron spokesman , said on friday that no energy - trading company had stopped doing business with enron . he declined to say whether any of the company ' s trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms . he said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business . but the crisis that enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is just a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront . for years , the details of enron ' s finances have been a mystery even to the wall street analysts whose job it is to follow the company , and to the investors who own its stock and bonds . when enron ' s profits were soaring and it was creating lucrative new markets , shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrability of its financial statements . now they do . yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to the questions investors ask . to others in the industry , the opaqueness of the company ' s financial statements parallels enron ' s efforts to keep its energy - trading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements . though they do not expect enron to crumble like long - term capital management , they say that , like the giant hedge fund , enron uses a lot of debt , regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances . the most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts enron created to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet . with names like marlin and osprey , the partnerships have at least $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds outstanding , backed by assets like a stake in azurix , enron ' s water company subsidiary . enron has promised that if the partnerships ' debts exceed the value of their assets , enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference . deals with partnerships formed by mr . fastow , who was chief financial officer when they were organized , led to the $ 1 . 2 billion write - off in shareholders ' equity that enron announced last week . the company has offered only skimpy details of its transactions with those partnerships . enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter , after being criticized by shareholders . in the process , it wrote off a promissory note that it had carried on its books , reducing its shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion . but , because of complex accounting rules , the transaction was not apparent in enron ' s quarterly earnings report . the transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that enron may have found a way to hide losses , throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question . when enron released third - quarter earnings on oct . 16 , it reported a loss from $ 1 billion in write - offs on failed investments . the earnings statement did not mention the additional $ 1 . 2 billion equity write - down . but the company said its core business had been solidly profitable , and its shares rose . in a conference call with analysts after the announcement , mr . lay , enron ' s chairman , also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity . the reference was a brief one , however , and some listeners did not catch it . those analysts were angered when they found out the next day what enron had done , and many were confused by the accounting procedure . enron ' s stock began to slide , and investors clamored for more information about the write - off . but so far , the company ' s efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors . mr . lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals , but some on wall street say they have come away with doubts about mr . lay ' s grasp of the situation . they say that the two people at enron who appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals - - mr . skilling and mr . fastow - - have both left the company . in an interview in late august , mr . lay said he did not know some details about the deals involving mr . fastow . in response to one question about them , he said , ' ' you ' re getting way over my head . ' ' mr . palmer of enron disputed any suggestion that mr . lay did not have a grasp of the investments at issue , saying mr . lay was handicapped in talking about them because of the s . e . c . investigation . ' ' there is not a whole lot we can say , or should say , about them , ' ' mr . palmer said . he also said the company expected to generate about $ 3 billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year . in a conference call on tuesday , analysts pressed mr . lay and other top enron executives to reveal more information about the ljm write - down and its other partnerships . instead , they offered only vague explanations of the deal , leaving wall street worried that more write - offs might be coming . david fleischer , a goldman , sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company , was among those who came away concerned . ' ' if enron is unable to clarify its off - balance - sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position , then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets , ' ' he wrote in a research note after the call . to try to reassure investors , enron said late thursday that enrononline , its internet - based trading exchange , executed more than 8 , 400 trades that day , a higher - than - normal volume . ' ' we know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community - - and we ' re working on that , ' ' mr . lay said in a statement . ' ' but in the meantime , the best evidence of our strength is the willingness of customers to bring their business to enron . ' ' but those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for wall street . enron ' s stock tumbled almost 6 percent friday , to its lowest levels in six years . now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of enron ' s off - balance - sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities in houston , calculates that enron may have close to $ 9 billion in off - balance - sheet debt . she said that enron had for two years been trying to sell about $ 6 billion in foreign assets - - including properties in latin america and a power plant in india embroiled in a dispute with the state government - - and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of enron ' s problems and the souring economy . ' ' as enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs , they may have to write those assets down , ' ' ms . coale said . on wednesday , she downgraded her rating on enron to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' neutral . ' ' ' ' the bottom line is , it ' s really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts , ' ' ms . coale said . short - sellers , who attacked enron ' s accounting even before the company disclosed the write - off , say the company ' s problems may run even deeper than analysts fear . enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money - losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business , they say . ' ' the company still isn ' t disclosing enough to know whether the core business , the trading business , is profitable , ' ' said mark roberts , director of research at off wall street , which recommended shorting enron ' s stock on may 7 , when it stood at $ 59 . 43 . ' ' the issue remains : why are they doing these transactions ? our theory has been that the core operations aren ' t that profitable . ' ' james chanos , a leading short - seller who has bet that enron ' s stock will fall , said , ' ' is enron booking gains when it has real profits , but hiding the losses when deals go against it ? ' ' mr . palmer of enron said the company stood by its reported energy - trading profits . even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of enron ' s positions . enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced - - meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset , in roughly equivalent amounts , by energy it has agreed to buy . ' ' with these guys , they tell us - - and all you ' ve got is their word - - that they ' re hedged , ' ' said mr . verleger , the economist . in fact , enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations . last year , the company successfully lobbied congress to effectively ensure that its internet - trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the commodity futures trading commission . enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the federal energy regulatory commission , the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets . but the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices . large - scale energy trading has existed for only about a half - dozen years . enron pioneered the business , and now dominates it , accounting for about one - quarter of all trading in the united states . before congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale electricity , a process that began in earnest a decade ago , the power business was a simpler affair . utilities were given areas of monopoly service , and their rates - - and ability to deliver enough electricity - - were overseen by state regulators . but with the move to deregulate the business , independent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished , providing an ever - growing portion of the nation ' s power . beginning in the 1980 ' s , the sale and transportation of natural gas was also deregulated , spurring enron , which used to be primarily a gas - pipeline company , to move into the trading business . the company ' s shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid - 1990 ' s , with the ascension of mr . skilling , who became chief executive in february , just six months before his unexpected resignation . underscoring the change in direction , in securities filings this year enron described its principal business as ' ' security brokers , dealers and flotation . ' ' before , it had said it was in the business of ' ' wholesale - petroleum and petroleum products . ' ' for most of its ascent , enron reported outstanding profit figures and wall street accepted them with pleasure . a year ago , when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by mr . fastow , the company ' s former chief financial officer , analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of mr . fastow ' s involvement . enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch . but the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short - term debt will have to be renegotiated next spring . the controversial partnerships do not have to pay their debts until the following year - - unless enron loses its investment - grade credit rating before that . enron will also need to maintain its large trading positions , which could suffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about enron ' s credit . when long - term capital was stumbling in 1998 , some wall street rivals sold the securities they thought long - term owned , trying to force long - term to sell its positions quickly and at a loss . something similar in energy markets might be possible . if so , enron might find , as long - term did , that positions that should offset each other do not . enron ' s new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the company ' s profits are real , and that its condition is better than the short - sellers believe . as questions are answered , confidence , and the share price , could rebound . but for now , investors are skittish , and some competitors are eager to take advantage of enron ' s plight . photos : enron , which is building a new headquarters in houston , grew with deregulation . but with deregulation in doubt , enron stock has dropped .

' ' enron treated that like a share buyback , even though the shares in question had not been issued , and determined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce reported earnings . q . is that legal under the accounting rules ? a . presumably it is . but enron ' s limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure . enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements , while leaving profits on them . that may become clearer when the securities and exchange commission , which has begun preliminary inquiries , completes its work . floyd norris copyright ? 2000 dow jones section 3 databank investors seem to ignore discouraging news by michael brick 10 / 28 / 2001 the new york times page 17 , column 3 c . 2001 new york times company investors sent stocks markedly higher last week , despite reports on the economy and corporate profits that were resoundingly poor . the dow jones industrial average , strengthened by triple - digit rallies on monday and thursday , ended the week nearly back to its level of sept . 10 , one day before the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon . broader indicators ended slightly higher than they were on sept . 10 . investors overcame their initial discouragement about reports that orders for durable goods and sales of existing homes were deteriorating faster than expected . they also seemed unfazed by reports of corporate profits declining from a year ago , at some companies by more than 30 percent . all the bad news , investors seemed to surmise , meant that the government was more likely to act aggressively in stimulating the economy , with tax breaks , spending and lower interest rates . the dow average gained 341 . 06 , or 3 . 7 percent , to close at 9 , 545 . 17 . the nasdaq composite index rose 97 . 65 points , or 5 . 8 percent , to 1 , 768 . 96 . the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index rose 31 . 13 , or 2 . 9 percent , to 1 , 104 . 61 . michael brick charts : ' ' stocks in the news ' ' enron nyse : ene the energy trading company ousted its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron caught the attention of the s . e . c . friday ' s close : $ 15 . 40 week ' s change : - 40 . 88 % est .

' s even as they lay off tens of thousands of their employees . to see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland security , you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes back to its creation - - and one that explains the recent trials of poor tom ridge . mr . ridge is by all accounts a capable leader - - a successful governor of a large state ( pennsylvania ) who won the bronze star for heroism in vietnam . a close friend of george w . bush , he should have been in the administration from the get - go , and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various jobs , including the vice presidency . but after being pilloried by the right because he supports abortion rights , he got zilch . instead of mr . ridge , the administration signed on the pro - life john ashcroft and tommy thompson - - who have brought us where we are today . the farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those of public relations - - though mr . thompson often comes across as a chamber of commerce glad - hander who doesn ' t know his pants are on fire , and mr . ashcroft often shakes as if he ' s not just seen great caesar ' s ghost but perhaps john mitchell ' s as well . both have a history of letting politics override public policy that dates to the start of the administration . they ' ve seen no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the patriotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their no . 1 concern . pre - sept . 11 , mr . thompson , in defiance of science , heartily lent his credibility to the bush administration ' s stem cell ' ' compromise ' ' by going along with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lines it would deliver to researchers . post - sept . 11 , he destroyed his credibility by understating the severity of the anthrax threat , also in defiance of science . now he maintains that the $ 1 . 5 billion the administration is requesting to plug the many holes in our public health system - - almost all of it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals , not shoring up local hospitals - - is adequate for fighting bioterrorism . this , too , is in defiance of all expert estimates , including that of the one physician in the senate , the republican bill frist . it should also be on mr . thompson ' s conscience that for the first two weeks of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government ' s house physician - - david satcher , the surgeon general and a much - needed honest broker of public health - - locked away , presumably because dr . satcher , a clinton appointee , became persona non grata in the bush administration for issuing a june report on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right . only after mr . ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gulag . as for mr . ashcroft , he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand information about domestic terrorism for political reasons . planned parenthood , which has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim necessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them , has sought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has never been granted one . this was true not only before sept . 11 but , says ann glazier , planned parenthood ' s director of security , remains true - - even though her organization , long targeted by such home - grown talibans as the army of god , has a decade ' s worth of leads on ' ' the convergence of international and domestic terrorism . ' ' ms . glazier found the sight of mr . ashcroft and other federal keystone kops offering a $ 1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication of how little grasp they have of the enemy . ' ' religious extremists don ' t respond to money , ' ' she points out . such is the state of the f . b . i . , she adds , that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of days ' ' because we have so many here we ' re afraid we ' re going to lose it ' ' ( perhaps among the timothy mcveigh documents ) . if either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human services inspired anything like the confidence that , say , mayor giuliani does , there wouldn ' t have been a need to draft mr . ridge . even so , he ' s mainly a p . r . gimmick - - a man who should have been in the administration in the first place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights . as director of homeland security , he ' s allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 government agencies - - so far with roughly a dozen staff members . when asked to define mr . ridge ' s responsibilities , ari fleischer said on wednesday that it was ' ' a very busy coordination job , ' ' but so far mr . ridge is mainly sowing still more confusion . the one specific duty that he has claimed - - in an interview with tom brokaw - - was that he ' d be the one ' ' making the phone call ' ' to the president to shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers . that presumably comes as news to donald rumsfeld , who made no provision for any homeland security czar in the air force chain of command he publicly codified days after mr . ridge ' s appointment . since the administration tightly metes out the news from afghanistan , we can only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the war here - - even as mr . rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the taliban , once expected to implode in days , are proving viet - cong - like in their intractability . the wall street journal also reported this week that ' ' instead of a thankful afghan population , popular support for the taliban appears to be solidifying and anger with the u . s . growing .

"I call PacBell/SBC every two or three months about a recurring problem 
we have at my house:We get a phone bill every month for someone who no longer lives at our 
house for a phone line which has been disconnected for over three years 
and the account balance is (drum roll please) $0.00! Sometimes the 
people I talk to cannot locate the account in their system and tell me 
that the phone number doesn't exist. Some people are able to locate the 
account but say that it has been disconnected and there is no way we 
could get a bill sent to us for that account. Some people can locate the 
account and verify that the line has been disconnected for three years 
and that the amount owed is $0.00 and then they say somthing along the 
lines of ""Huh?"" or ""I'm not sure what's going on... Hold please."" And 
eventually I have similar conversations with their managers and the 
account representatives and billing people and their managers and their 
managers' managers ad naseum.The outcome of every phone call is that they'll ""look into it"" and fix 
the problem and I might receive one or two more bills depending on when 
it's resolved. So I wait a month or two and send the bills back marked 
""Not at this address, please fsck off."" and then eventually call them 
back and go through the whole process again. Lately I just explain to 
the phone jockeys that I know it's not their fault and I'm not mad at 
them and it's just not their day because I'm about to give them hell. 
Then I give them the opportunity to have me yell at their boss which 
they seem all too happy to do.At least it gives me a positive way to vent my aggressions and it's a 
lot cheaper than seeing a therapist.Perplexed,
Elias
