- sb 18 xx ( burton ) , sb 78 xx ( polanco ) , ab 82 xx ( keeley ) and ab 83 xx ( wright ) - - are still "" in play "" legislatively this evening , even though the governor told the dow jones newswire earlier today that the proposals are not acceptable to him in their current form and encouraged the assembly and senate to stay in session ( despite the scheduled summer break ) until a bill acceptable to him could be agreed upon by the two houses and sent to him for signature : * sb 78 xx ( polanco ) electric utility rate stabilization act of 2001 passed out of the full senate on friday with 22 ayes and 17 noes . the originally introduced version of sb 78 xx reflected the terms of the original memorandum of understanding ( "" mou "" ) negotiated between governor davis and southern california edison ( "" edison "" ) . it was recently amended to reflect senator sher ' s proposed "" plan b "" of the mou - - a version of the mou opposed by edison on the grounds that the bill would not leave edison creditworthy . it was heard in the senate energy , utilities and communications committee on wednesday where it failed on a 4 ayes and 3 noes vote . reconsideration was granted , however , and the bill passed out of the committee with 6 ayes and 2 noes on thursday morning . the authors took up amendments such as striking the urgency clause , changing the rate component from 125 kws to 500 kws , placing conservation lands into land trusts and deleting section 399 . 26 ( which insulated edison international from certain claims ) during the thursday hearing . sb 78 xx was then passed out of the senate appropriations committee on thursday with 7 ayes and 3 noes . * sb 18 xx ( burton ) department of water resources : electricity : bond financing order passed out of the full senate on friday with 35 ayes and 2 noes , making it possible for dwr to issue bonds at a lower , cheaper rate than allotted in ab lx ( keeley ) assuming the assembly concurs and the bill is signed by governor davis . the bill also prohibits any additional charges such as consultants and ad campaigns unless approved by the legislature and requires certain "" sunshine "" provisions for greater scrutiny of contracts entered to by the dwr . we understand that j . p . morgan and lehman brothers - - the firms working with state treasurer angelides on the bond offering - - have advised the governor ' s office that sb 18 xx could delay the issuance of the bonds indefinitely for a variety of reasons , so it is unclear whether this bill will ever be signed . the bill was heard by the senate energy , utilities and communications committee on thursday where it passed with a 10 ayes and 0 noes vote . it next must be heard in the assembly . * ab 82 xx ( keeley ) electric utility rate stabilization act of 2001 passed out of assembly energy costs and availability committee wednesday evening on a 11 ayes and 9 noes vote . it was then heard later the same evening by the assembly appropriations committee , where it was passed on a 11 ayes and 6 noes vote . this is the "" compromise "" bill we have been discussing all week authored by speaker hertzberg and assembly member fred keeley . the bill continues to be a work in progress as we write this report , with significant amendments being considered and awaiting a vote by the full assembly , possibly later this evening . the current version of the bill provides for limited direct access , state purchase of edison ' s transmission lines for $ 2 . 4 billion , a minimum 30 percent "" haircut "" for the major generators and a "" trust "" to cover all claims not dealt with by the haircut option . * ab 83 xx ( wright ) alternative electric utility rate stabilization act of 2001 was amended into ab 50 xx ( by assembly member bill campbell ) in the assembly energy costs and availability committee wednesday evening , and then passed out of committee with 11 ayes and 9 noes . it next must be heard by the assembly appropriations committee , barring a rule waiver . no such committee hearing is scheduled at this time . co - authored by assembly members rod wright , keith richman , joe canciamilla and bill campbell , the bill would allow the utilities to impose a basic monthly charge to address the net undercollection , among other things . other energy - related developments this week include : * sb 84 xx ( burton ) state energy resources conservation and development commission passed out of the full senate on friday with 30 ayes and 1 no and sent to the assembly . this bill provides $ 10 million from the state general fund to the california energy commission ( "" cec "" ) to fund a matching grant program for a battery backup power source for led traffic signals . the grant program will be administered by the cec , in consultation with local governments , and will provide 70 percent of the cost of the battery backup system . it next must be heard in the assembly . * the ferc is expected to consider disbanding the current iso board for an independent slate of directors on wednesday , the ferc announced on friday . despite a dec 15 , 2000 , ferc order requiring the appointment of an independent governing board for the iso , the state has refused to follow the order citing that only the state legislature can change the composition of the board . supporters of the ferc order argue that political appointees should not oversee power markets due to the state ' s domineering role in purchasing power on behalf of the beleaguered utilities . * sb 85 xx ( burton ) electrical restructuring : rates passed out of the full senate on thursday with 37 ayes and 0 noes . this bill bars the california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) from raising rates back to the pre - 10 percent rate reduction levels solely because the mandatory rate reduction period has expired on march 31 , 2002 . it next must be heard in the assembly . * the senate gave authorization to the senate select committee to investigate market manipulation on thursday to subpoena top energy company executives to provide testimony and further insight into their companies ' trading practices . the resolution - - sr 14 - - passed out with 28 ayes and 6 noes . * the senate select committee to investigate market manipulation voted unanimously on wednesday to ask the full senate to find texas - based reliant energy in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for documents . despite reliant ' s having handed over 10 , 000 documents , the committee rejected them after being unable to reach agreement over the confidentiality of reliant ' s documents . the committee stepped back from its contempt vote last week against enron after the company and committee moved closer to agreement over its release of thousands of documents stored in texas . mirant resolved its pending contempt citation by agreeing to turn over subpoenaed documents . the contempt citation against reliant will be presented to the full senate , and then immediately sent to the rules committee for another hearing before the full senate acts , dunn said . * the state ' s estimate of being overcharged for electricity dropped from $ 8 . 9 billion to $ 6 . 1 billion after a ferc judge ordered a readjustment in the state ' s figure on wednesday . although the state continues to argue that the $ 8 . 9 billion figure is correct , ferc judge curtis wagner called the figure "" baseless "" and criticized the california delegation for "" not negotiating in good faith "" during the recent settlement discussions . the new amount , $ 6 . 1 billion , does not include power sales to municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers - - two entities that do not fall under the purview of the iso , px or the state dwr - - as well as applies ferc price controls imposed june 19 and retroactively takes into account sales from october 2 onward . * ab 28 xx ( migden ) electrical restructuring : oversight board : iso passed out of the senate energy , utilities and communications committee on tuesday to senate appropriations with 7 ayes and 0 noes . it was amended by the author in committee to "" double - join "" it to sb 39 xx ( see below ) . this amendment "" ties "" the ultimate fate of ab 28 xx to the fate of ab 39 xx , unless the double - joiner language is removed from the bill before it goes to the governor for signature , assuming the bill gets to the governor . * sb 39 xx ( speier ) public utilities failed to pass out of the assembly energy costs and availability committee on tuesday with 7 ayes and 10 noes . reconsideration for the bill to be reheard in the committee was granted to the author . given the failure of sb 39 xx in committee , ab 28 xx is effectively "" dead "" as well for the moment ( see discussion of ab 28 xx above . ) best regards , tom mcmorrow and mike martinez > -

"Macromedia Shockwave Flash Malformed Header OverflowRelease Date: August 8, 2002Severity:
High (Remote Code Execution)Systems Affected:
Macromedia Shockwave Flash - All Versions;
Unix and Windows; Netscape and Internet ExplorerDescription:
While working on some pre-release eEye Retina CHAM tools, an exploitable
condition was discovered within the Shockwave Flash file format called SWF
(pronounced ""SWIF"").Since this is a browser based bug, it makes it trivial to bypass firewalls
and attack the user at his desktop. Also, application browser bugs allow you
to target users based on the websites they visit, the newsgroups they read,
or the mailing lists they frequent. It is a ""one button"" push attack, and
using anonymous remailers or proxies for these attacks is possible.This vulnerability has been proven to work with all versions of Macromedia
Flash on Windows and Unix, through IE and Netscape. It may be run wherever
Shockwave files may be displayed or attached, including: websites, email,
news postings, forums, Instant Messengers, and within applications utilizing
web-browsing functionality.Technical Description:
The data header is roughly made out to:[Flash signature][version (1)][File Length(A number of bytes too
short)][frame size (malformed)][Frame Rate (malformed)][Frame Count
(malformed)][Data]By creating a malformed header we can supply more frame data than the
decoder is expecting. By supplying enough data we can overwrite a function
pointer address and redirect the flow of control to a specified location as
soon as this address is used. At the moment the overwritten address takes
control flow, an address pointing to a portion of our data is 8 bytes back
from the stack pointer. By using a relative jump we redirect flow into a
""call dword ptr [esp+N]"", where N is the number of bytes from the stack
pointer. These ""jump points"" can be located in multiple loaded dll's. By
creating a simple tool using the debugging API and ReadMemory, you can
examine a process's virtual address space for useful data to help you with
your exploitation.This is not to say other potentially vulnerable situations have not been
found in Macromedia's Flash. We discovered about seventeen others before we
ended our testing. We are working with Macromedia on these issues.Protection:
Retina(R) Network Security Scanner already scans for this latest version of
Flash on users' systems. Ensure all users within your control upgrade their
systems.Vendor Status:
Macromedia has released a patch for this vulnerability, available at:

Software contracts: Clause for alarmIn the high-stakes game of corporate software negotiations, the silver-tongued sales rep isn't your biggest challenge: It's 
the language in the contracts. Enterprise customers spend surprisingly little time pouring over the fine print of 
multi-million dollar software contracts that are rife with obscure terminology, vague expansion charges, and mind-boggling 
license conversions. As a result, they end up paying in ways they had never imagined long after the deal is signed. Just 
ask California.

Übrigens : die schuldennachrichten sind ein . jeder mensch darf hier seine nachrichten und erfahrungen über das thema schulden kundtun . hinweise am ende der mail . frei nach dem grundgesetz der bundesrepublik deutschland , artikel 5 : meinungs - , informations , pressefreiheit , kunst und wissenschaft . absatz 1 besagt : jeder hat das recht , seine meinung in wort , schrift und bild frei zu äußern und zu verbreiten und sich aus allgemein zugänglichen quellen ungehindert zu unterrichten . die pressefreiheit und die freiheit der berichterstattung durch rundfunk und film werden gewährleistet . eine zensur findet nicht statt . inhalt diesmal in den schuldennachrichten i . die ersten privatinsolvenzen sind abgeschlossen ii . insolvenz im ausland iii . wenn der gerichtsvollzieher klingelt iv . geerbte schulden ausschlagen v . muss man an inkassobüros zahlen ? vi . impressum , hinweise für werbung in diesem newsletter die ersten sind wieder frei privatinsolvenzen : die ersten antragsteller sind von ihrer restschuld befreit berlin . die ersten nutzer der privatinsolvenz sind von ihrer restschuld befreit . eine frist von sechs jahres setzt das 1999 in kraft getretene insolvenzgesetz schuldnern , in der sie ihre außenstände erlassen bekommen . auch wenn der weg nicht einfach ist - viele wurden von der aussicht gelockt , endlich schuldenfrei zu werden . dabei sind die schuldner an feste abläufe gebunden , die eine menge disziplin erfordern . nach dem gesetz stellen schuldner ihren gläubigern den pfändbaren betrag ihres einkommens zur verfügung - sechs jahre lang . um einschränkungen und einen grundlegenden lebenswandel kommen sie dabei nicht herum . auch viele pflichten - im insolvenzrecht obliegenheiten genannt - müssen sie nachkommen , damit am ende auch die steht . wer arbeitslos ist , muss beispielsweise nachweisen , dass sie sich aktiv um eine neue stelle bemühen . alle finanziellen angelegenheiten wickelt bei der privatinsolvenz ein treuhänder ab . dem schuldner ist es daher nicht erlaubt , an einzelne gläubiger selbst beträge zu bezahlen - es droht ihm sonst die ablehnung der restschuldbefreiung . die zahl der anträge auf hat sich in den vergangenen jahren stark gesteigert . beispielsweise in nordrhein - westfalen gingen 2000 noch 2 . 440 anträge ein . im vorjahr waren es schon 18 . 072 . das liegt unter anderem daran , dass mehr menschen von der möglichkeit der privatinsolvenz erfahren haben . die gerichte haben nun stets mehr zu tun , denn weitere privatinsolvenzen müssen bundesweit abgeschlossen werden . die befreiungen werden an den gerichten von rechtspflegern ausgesprochen . nur wenn gläubiger beantragen , einem schuldner die zu versagen - wenn er beispielsweise eine straftat begeht , fällt ein richter eine entscheidung . normalerweise klappt das verfahren aber . ( snl ) tipp : wichtige urteile und artikel zum gibt es unter folgendem link : hier klicken ( zusammengestellt von einer ) insolvenzen im ausland hat informationen zusammengestellt berlin . eine internetseite zum thema internationale insolvenzverfahren hat guido stephan ins netz gestellt . wer mehr über ausländische gesetze , formulare und literaturtipps wissen will , sollte sich mal auf seine homepage klicken . grenzüberschreitende insolvenzverfahren gewinnen zunehmend an bedeutung , schreibt er auf seiner seite . für die bundesrepublik deutschland sei es als exportnation wichtig , wie deutsche unternehmen ihre rechte in der insolvenz des ausländischen geschäftspartners geltend machen können . auch bei einem im inland eröffneten insolvenzverfahren sei es von interesse , wie ausländisches vermögen des gemeinschuldners für ein inländisches verfahren verwertet werden kann . ( snl ) erreicht wird sein angebot unter der adresse http : / / www . inso - international . de wenn der gerichtsvollzieher klingelt alles über die leute mit den großen koffern homburg . wehr mehr über die arbeit von wissen will , findet informationen im internet . eine interessante seite hat der homburger gerichtsvollzieher roger zimmermann online gestellt . er schreibt über die arbeitsweisen , handwerkszeuge und sogar über ausbildungsstätten seiner kollegen . ( snl ) die homepage findet man unter http : / / www . der - gerichtsvollzieher . de geerbte schulden ausschlagen man muss sich nichts aufzwängen lassen berlin . stirbt ein familienmitglied , hat man es oft nicht nur mit trauer zu tun . war die person zum zeitpunkt des todes verschuldet , gehen die verpflichtungen auf die erben über . schulden und können einen schnell ruinieren . es gibt aber wege , das ungewollte erbe auszuschlagen . jedoch ist tempo gefordert : sechs wochen nach dem tod des angehörigen muss beim nachlassgericht oder einem notar eine erklärung abgeben werden , dass man die erbschaft ausschlägt . auch wenn sich erst nach sechs wochen herausstellt , dass der verstorbene nur schulden hinterlassen hat , hat man noch die möglichkeit das erbe anzufechten . wieder muss man innerhalb von sechs wochen handeln . grund für die anfechtung ist dann , dass sie sich über eine wesentliche eigenschaft des erbes geirrt haben - in diesem fall der schuldenberg . die frist bricht an , wenn man von der Überschuldung erfährt . sind beide fristen verstrichen , muss man einen antrag auf nachlassverwaltung / nachlassinsolvenz stellen . das kann man tun , wenn das erbe die schulden nicht abdeckt . den antrag kann man beim nachlassgericht stellen , bei dem der verstorbene zuletzt seinen wohnsitz angegeben hatte . wenn noch genug geld da ist , zahlt das gericht die ansprüche der gläubiger aus dem betrag . reicht das geld nicht einmal zur deckung der kosten des , wird das verfahren wegen fehlender masse eingestellt . auch dann muss man selbst nichts bezahlen : wird man dennoch von einem nachlassgläubiger genervt , kann man sich an einen anwalt oder die verbraucher - zentrale wenden . ( snl ) muss man an inkassobüros zahlen ? aufmerksame kontrolle der forderung ist wichtig berlin . viele gläubiger wollen mit hilfe von inkassobüros an ihre geld kommen . das ist besonders schwer für die schuldner , denn bekanntermaßen üben diese unternehmen oft dubiosen psychischen druck auf die menschen aus . man sollte sich davon nicht beeinflussen lassen und sein schon knappes konto noch weiter belasten . oft reichen die raten an inkassobüros nicht einmal für die deckung laufender kosten wie zinsen . so wird die forderung nicht weniger , sondern kann weiter ansteigen . auch erkennen sie mit einer zahlung die forderung juristisch an und man verzichtet auf eine mögliche verjährung . Überprüfen sie immer die forderungen , die das inkassounternehmen einziehen will . machen sie etwaige einwände sofort vor der zahlung geltend , sonst erkennen sie die forderung an . inkassobüros dürfen mit entsprechender genehmigung außergerichtlich fremde forderungen einziehen . man sollte sich daher stets die oder eine vollmacht , die der ursprüngliche gläubiger ausgestellt hat , zeigen lassen . kann das büro dem nicht nachkommen , leisten sie nur an ihren gläubiger und nicht an das inkassobüro . nicht zahlen muss man , wenn man den gläubiger rechtzeitig vor beauftragung des über die informiert hat . der darf dann wegen seiner die kosten durch einschaltung eines nicht unnötig erhöhen . einige beispiele aus der rechtsprechung : haben sie mit dem inkassobüro eine ratenzahlung vereinbart , darf hierfür keine  vergleichsgebühr "" abgerechnet werden . ( lg berlin juristisches büro 1988 / 545 ) pro mahngebühr darf ein inkassounternehmen nur die ungefähren portokosten berechnen . dies gilt allerdings nur , wenn es sich z . b . um forderungen aus warenlieferungen handelt . ( olg hammrr njw 1992 / 444 und olg stuttgart rr njw 1988 / 1082 ) bei forderungen aus krediten dürfen neben verzugszinsen keine mahngebühren geltend gemacht werden . ( bgh njw 1988 / 1971 ) die betreiber der schuldennachrichten distanzieren sich generell von den angeboten der werbepartner und den inhalten der darin enthaltenen links . anzeige hoffnungslos überschuldet ? probleme mit unfairen gläubigern ? keinen ausweg ? vielleicht sollten sie mal unsere informationsseite besuchen . . . - » » » die schuldenfibel « « « - inklusive dem konzept in sechs wochen schuldenfrei für weitere informationen klicken sie hier . . . impressum herausgeber der schulden - nachrichten ist die pm medienproduktion , erreichbar unter @ gmx . net bitte verzeihen sie , dass wir hier keine telefonnummer veröffentlichen . sollten sie einen anruf wünschen , geben sie in der email ihre telefonnummer sowie den grund des gesprächswunsches an . das angebot ist eine reine verbreitung von nachrichten zum thema schulden . es wird nichts verkauft , das angebot ist nicht kostenpflichtig . beiträge von gastautoren sind willkommen und können einfach an die oben angegebene email - adresse gesendet werden . die rechte auf veröffentlichung und kürzung behält sich der herausgeber jedoch vor . auch anfragen für werbeschaltungen , mit denen dieses projekt finanziert werden soll , richten sie bitte an diese adresse . wenn sie den newsletter nicht erhalten möchten , tragen sie sich bitte mit dem betreff austragen unter der gleichen adresse aus . vielen dank .",Phishing Email

( set : isbn 1-57473 - 015 - 0 ) lc : pc4074 . 85 . c66 1997 . reviewed by h . stephen straight , < sstraigh @ binghamton . edu > this two-volume work contains nineteen papers ( seventeen in english , two in spanish ) by an international set of 31 authors ( including eighteen at us universities and five each at universities in spain & canada ) , ranging in length from fifteen to 34 pages . they comprise revised versions of papers delivered at a conference held at pennsylvania state university in october 1995 . with separate sections on child and adult language acquisition ( 5 papers each ) and on second language production ( 5 papers ) and comprehension and input processing ( 4 papers ) , this work provides exactly the current and wide-ranging overview of issues suggested by its title . prominent senior scholars ( such as james p lantolf , james f lee , juana liceras , susana lopez - ornat , barbara lust , and bill vanpatten ) lend the work a rightful air of authority , while numerous junior contributors ( including a dozen phd candidates ) provide a welcome promise of more good work to come . highlights include lopez - ornat 's fascinating case study of the role of spanish - specific morphological patterning in l1 emergence of nominal and verbal forms and functions ( 1 : 3-20 ) , virginia c mueller gathercole & cecilia montes 's paradigm-challenging study of the emergence in bi - and monolingual children of grammaticality judgments regarding the opposing que / * that complementizer patterns in wh-extracted embedded clauses ( 1 : 75-95 ) , christina sanz 's finely nuanced account of the changing role of controlled versus automatized processes in l2 production as a function of performance task variables ( 2 : 41-56 ) , jeffrey reeder 's remarkable findings regarding the dissociation of phonetic perceptual skill and pronunciation accuracy in both beginning and advanced second language learners ( 2 : 77-90 ) , and bill vanpatten 's authoritative overview of his path-breaking research on input processing in second language learning and teaching ( 2 : 93-108 ) . specialist readers will appreciate the currency , range , and depth of the studies presented here . they will also appreciate their overall quality , rare in a collection of conference papers . both volumes contain a comprehensive index of mentioned authors and topics , while notes and full lists of references appear as they should at the end of each paper . advanced students will find the expositions quite uniformly accessible and clear , and the findings well presented and thoroughly discussed . the editors and anonymous reviewers did their jobs well . non - specialist readers will however find these volumes rather heavy going . although all of the papers successfully avoid jargon-mongering , even papers with enticing titles like "" the function of language play in the acquisition of l2 spanish "" ( james p lantolf , 2 : 3-24 ) contain theoretical discussion of great erudition and the analysis of empirical data of considerable complexity . ( lantolf 's 75 - item list of references includes works by vera john - steiner , alexei leontiev , david olson , lev vygotsky , and other important authors usually neglected in l2 research . ) although few readers will find all of the papers of interest , every paper makes a contribution to our understanding of its topic , and taken together these volumes contain something worth the close attention of every conceivable reader in linguistics , developmental and experimental psycholinguistics , and second language theory and pedagogy . given the longstanding facts of 1 ) the prominence of spanish as a national language in the new world , 2 ) the preeminence of spanish as the first language of bilinguals in the us , and 3 ) the ubiquity ( and , more recently , the predominance ) of spanish and english as the languages studied in schools and colleges throughout the americas , spanish language acquisition and spanish - english child and adult bilingualism ought to be among the most common and well-supported areas of basic and applied psycholinguistic research . without going into the cultural , economic , and political factors that have held back such research , and that have pushed the study of spanish - english bilingualism almost entirely into the politically charged domain of ( mostly spanish - subtractive ) "" bilingual education "" , we can be grateful to p&g for bringing together an impressive array of high-quality studies that should stimulate many to pay more attention to these widely available sources of data on critical issues in l1 and l2 acquisition theory and in the psycholinguistics ( as opposed to the sociolinguistics ) of bilingualism . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ h stephen straight ( phd chicago 1972 ) , professor of anthropology and of linguistics , directs the programs in linguistics and in languages across the curriculum at binghamton university ( suny ) , where he has taught since 1970 . his research includes study of yucatec maya l1 acquisition , comparative sociolinguistics , translation theory , l2 pedagogy , multilingual education , and the role of the reception-expression dialectic in models of language and cognitive processes .",Safe Email

"errors in language learning . james , carl . ( 1998 ) . errors in language learning and use : exploring error analysis . london : longman . isbn 0 582 25763 - 8 ( paperback ) . rrp : 14 . 99 . the analysis of errors in cognitive , linguistic and other psychological processes has a long history dating back to the introduction of signal detection theory in psychophysics and behavioural learning paradigms . although many applied linguists now favour interlanguage paradigms for second-language acquisition , error analysis ( ea ) is still widely used in language classes . the attraction of ea lies in one 's ability to isolate variability in responses , such as distinguishing true errors from "" mistakes "" , which simple "" correct / incorrect "" paradigms tend to discard . in this new book on ea in language learning and usage , carl james builds on his earlier work on contrastive analysis and applied linguistics to further explore the role that performance errors play in language acquisition ( particularly second-language acquisition ) . the book consists of a historical overview of ea in applied linguistics , and then embarks on an ambitious attempt to both define and constrain the scope and methodology of ea in language processing and language learning . this methodology includes typologies for classifying and understanding how errors arise , as well as algorithmic specifications for the diagnosis and error correction in clinical and educational settings . the first chapter aims to give a historical overview of ea in the context of its origins , its inspirations , its competitors , and its influences on second language teaching . james defines an error as "" an unsuccessful bit of language "" ( p . 1 ) which seems to be as succinct and compact a description as i ' ve ever read ! however , this very readable style of writing , whilst appearing informal , is maintained through later chapters where discussion of technical issues could easily have been obfuscated by a poor writing style . first - and second-order paradigms within language learning are described in detail in this chapter , with the interlanguage and crosslinguistic approaches compared with alternatives such as ea and contrastive analysis . idiosyncratic and language-specific difficulties in language learnability are also covered in the context of linguistic change and metalinguistic influences on successful language acquisition . several methods for collecting data in ea are informally introduced in this chapter ( e . g . , error elicitations such as the "" broad trawl "" ) , which naturally leads into the second chapter on defining the scope of ea in language acquisition . the second chapter begins with an enlightening discussion of popular conceptions of what "" proper "" language is ( such as the king 's english ) , and catalogues the many failed attempts to enforce a "" correct "" dialect of english both in britain and asia ( the "" complaints "" tradition ) . this issue is clearly relevant for defining exactly what an error is , given the absolutist attributions made by some educators and policy makers about the tenability or correctness of certain forms of spoken and written english ( i . e . , "" standard "" english ) . james outlines some typologies for understanding language norms based on geographical and historical constraints , but correctly identifies deficiencies in these schemes ( particularly the failure , for example , to understand the role of colonialism in language preferences ) . this issue is taken up with respect to the issue of power and authority of native speakers with respect to non-native speakers of english , and conversely how the desire to speak a second language can unwittingly result in language loss and native - language change . chapters 3 , 4 and 5 focus on the definition and description of errors within the ea paradigm , having defined the focus of the ea methodology in the previous chapters . james begins by defining learners ' ignorance of a target language in terms of four categories of deviance : grammaticality , acceptability , correctness and strangeness . it is a clear advantage of the authors ' approach to ea that both grammatical / rational and performance / empirical approaches to language acquisition are covered by his typology , thus not "" taking sides "" with one viewpoint or the other . this rationale is based on the idea that ea is a methodology rather than a theoretical prescription . this focus continues with a discussion of error detection methods , in the context of locating and describing such errors in different parts of speech and indeed with respect to discourses longer than single sentences or phrases . the importance of a pluralistic approach which is tolerant of differences in dialects is emphasised , whilst ensuring that objective and stationary criteria are applied to utterances and writing within each dialect group . error taxonomies , such as feature and surface structure approaches , are outlined in detail with worked examples , which are one of the key design features of the authors ' pedagogical approach . computer - assisted analysis of errors is also discussed , as are specific algorithmic approaches to rating levels of error in lexical and grammatical processes . the next two chapters focus on diagnosing errors and evaluating their seriousness and impact for second-language learners in particular . possible negative influences , such as interlingual errors arising from conflicts between the target language and mother tongue , are treated in detail , as are intralingual errors and inconsistencies which the non-native speaker encounters for the first time in the target language , such as over-generalisations and false analogies . in addition , the role of culture in influencing and perhaps determining some aspects of linguistic behaviour is discussed , for example , how native speakers might "" gate "" a non-native speaker . error gravity and comprehensibility are also covered , as are some amusing examples given for "" the irritation factor "" . the sociopragmatic consequences of error production in social situations , and the potentially negative outcomes for non-native speakers , are also discussed . chapter 8 discusses pragmatic strategies for using ea to correct errors in speech and writing for second language learners . these are enhanced by a number of case studies presented in chapter 9 . the issues covered in these last two chapters are non-trivial for applied linguistics : is second - language teaching effective ? if so , which approaches are best suited to particular kinds of students ? are formal / grammatical or informal / conversational approaches superior ? although james provides no magic answers for any of these questions , he does present a coherent methodology for answering these kinds of questions for individual situations , which is the great appeal of this book . this book would be suitable as an undergraduate or graduate text in applied linguistics or tesl programmes , but will be an invaluable reference for researchers in related fields such as psycholinguistics and machine translation , who might be searching for a more formal methodology for understanding error production in their respective fields . this book will be an indispensable addition to every linguist 's library . reviewed by : paul a . watters , department of computing , school of mathematics , physics , computing and electronics , macquarie university nsw 2109 , australia . tel . : + 61 -

"re : racist linguist plot ( linguist list : vol-5 - 1467 ) regarding steven schaufele 's recent posting on "" language amongst the anthropoidea , or , the racist linguist plot "" , wherein he claims never to have noticed any anti-animal "" racism "" in his training : i remember knowing about racism but not yet knowing about institutionalized racism - - wherein an institution is so permeated with racism that people are not even aware that what they say or do is racist . but let 's change the word "" racist "" to * species-ist * , since 1 ) racist does n't exactly fit cross-species issues except in the older meaning of "" human race "" , 2 ) species-ist points more clearly to our anthropocentrism , and 3 ) i no longer like to use the current concept of race because the history of its use over only the past 100 years with this particular meaning ( check the oed ) has not proven useful to me for inclusion into any explanations . dr . schaufele says , ) i certainly do n't remember anything in the introductory survey ) courses i ' ve taken myself . . . so much as hinting that it is an ) a priori assumption of the field of linguistics that language ) is the exclusive prerogative of homo sapiens . maybe the hints were all around , but never noticed . let 's next consider whether linguistics may be guilty of not overt but * covert * and institutionalized species-ism , embedded so pervasively as to be invisible to some . moonhawk 's institutionalized species - ism hypothesis predicts that unwitting species-ism will be reflected : * in textbooks through the positing of such processes as syntax and morphology ( which we claim animals do n't have ) as "" universals of language "" * in the use of metonymy ( part for whole ) to define * language * in terms of these putative universals , syntax & morphology , processes we claim only humans have , and then in calling everything else without such machinery * communication * ( which * true linguists * do n't study or publish on . ( n . b . , it 's not like you can go to a school or department of * communication * to study how animals communicate - - - so this is terminological limbo : few linguists really care what animals do ; it 's seen as irrelevant ) . * such truisms as "" there are no primitive languages "" in our intro classes - - where primitive is tacitly understood to mean "" with reduced or without the machinery of morphology & syntax "" . ( this automatically disallows what apes , cetaceans and others do from being called language , given our other claims above . ) * the omission of "" chimpanzee "" in the inventory of world 's languages * such constructs as lad ( language acquisition device ) and "" innate predisposition to language "" applied uniquely to humans . ( have you ever seen anyone positing either construct for the great apes or cetaceans ? ) * in standard theories and stories on the "" origins of language "" with exclusively human protagonists ( bow - wow and yo - he - ho theories , biblical tower of babel ) * in language acquisition classes that study primarily what humans do , with some emphasis on how humans diverge from animals just for comparison 's sake , to see how we take off developmentally from where they stop * in such phrases as "" uniquely human "" and "" social contract "" ( "" signs of the apes , songs of the whales , "" , nova , 1984 , discussing washoe 's use of asl : "" washoe has crossed the line into exclusively human territory . "" ) these are just the tip of the iceberg , off the top of the head . look around with sensitive eyes and you ' ll see the subtle signs of this species-ism everywhere . no one has to plot or say anything overtly species-ist because , given the totality of our system , animals can never break through our self-imposed cultural definitional language barrier ( as sue savage - rumbaugh so aptly notes ) . if a chimp and a child perform exactly the same behavior , the child 's is adjudged * linguistic * and the chimp 's is not , because children , unlike chimps , are said to be "" on their way to language "" ( i . e . , syntax ) . [ thanks to marilyn silva for her assistance to this point ; she thoroughly disavows any connection with what follows ! ] just so that we may see this species-ism more clearly , first a teaching i ' ve posted before , and then a brief outline for a model from a species-inclusive point of view that flows from the teaching . "" long ago , men and animals and spirits and plants all communicated in the same way . then something happened . after that , humans had to speak to each other in human speech . but we retained the old language for dreams , and for communicating with spirits , animals , and plants . "" this is what a non-species - ist ( cheyenne ) language origin story looks like - - all of nature communicating in a common way , and then * humans * moving out of that system and doing something different , the human kind of language , but remaining still connected to the original language processes whether they know it or not . wilhelm von humbolt , founder of linguistics as a university discipline , observed : "" man , regarded as an animal , belongs to one of the singing species ; but his notes are always associated with ideas . "" non - species-ist accounts are alway inclusive and evolutionary , not exclusive . and now for a model that flows naturally from the story . 1 ) we now call * language * every "" natural system "" which has utterances ( incl . sound , gesture , chemical , etc . ) combined with meaning . 2 ) we notice that as well as this sharing , humans also have differences - - different language processes that animals do n't seem to have ( morphology & syntax ) , so we call them two processes of human-specific language , the human kind of language , or just * human language * - - but we no longer designate it by merely the bare word * language * in the old exclusivist , species-ist way . this model declares that humans partake of other processes in the more inclusive * language * as well as those of specifically * human language * , so we look for similarities between humans and animals . indeed , both have motor / gestural components and spatial syntax associated with utterances and meaning , and both ( at least those with limbic systems * * * ) modulate emotions into their utterances . and , perhaps most important of the similarities , both utter idioms ! idioms are funny critters , when you think about it ; as the george foremans of the * hidden side * of linguistics - - the part of human language that does n't work by normal human language rules - - they tend to knock out every bit of morphological and syntactic machinery they encounter , not play by the rules , and consequently can help us question our culturally condoned uniqueness attitude as well . let me explain . it struck me recently , and i ' ve never encountered anyone else discussing this similarity , that the definition of idioms or formulaic speech - - utterances whose meaning cannot be pieced together from the meanings of the pieces , but must be attached to the whole utterance - - is exactly the same as the definition for any act of non-human communication you can find in the textbooks ( for bee dances , bird songs , etc . ) . in fact this definition is perhaps why non-human beings are usually said not to have ( human ) language - - because the pieces of their utterances can't be added up to make the whole meaning the way we say we can using morphology and syntax in human language . humans and animals thus intersect in * language * , in its entire evolutionary range , at most levels - - idioms , sounds , emotions , gestures ( pheromones ? ) - - and then humans only sometimes also construct new utterances from scratch . most typically we tend to use more idioms & formulaic speech with those we know well , and use it less with strangers , with whom we tend to use more formal and public speech . bees and birds and trees tend to know each other in their groups very well and can therefore be said to use idioms in their own languaging . just like us ! - - that is , unless we want to call ourselves sub-human and merely communicating , not using language , when we use idioms and formulaic speech . this move , should you accept it , irrevocably puts humans , land animals , sea creatures , trees , and maybe more , all on the same * language * map . but can these ' wild ' speculations , however evolutionarily based , actually be accomodated within a "" real "" linguistic theory ? about 15 years ago , charles fillmore was working on a unified approach i really admire ( and perhaps it 's a partial fulfillment of the reconciliation annabel cormack called for in vol-5 - 1469 on trends in lx ) , which goes something like this ( any errors are mine ) : when we are "" online "" composing / speaking , which i now must see as similar to dan slobin 's "" thinking for speaking "" mode , our process is to ' reach ' first for a handy ready-made piece of formulaic speech , and then , failing that - - lacking a ' match ' or not liking the proffered ' match ' - - we go on to construct from scratch . nature simply does n't have the further "" from scratch "" level , but shares everything to that level . fillmore 's formulation seems to fit quite nicely the picture of the evolutionary development of language ( and its synchronic effects ) that i have attempted to sketch here . ( sorry for any embarassment my use of it may have caused you , chuck ! ) the degree to which the above species-inclusive formulations may tend to disturb you quite faithfully reflects , i would guess , the degree to which you are embedded in the institutionalized species-ism so pervasive in linguistics , since these formulations are quite possibly the first truly * alternative * origins theory you have ever seen . because language and intelligence are usually linked , this more compassionate model also has the advantage of placing intelligence in nature and not so much the burden of just human beings . with this approach , linguistics could forge an academic path toward reconcilliation between western minds and nature that could provide a powerful rationale for at least slowing down , if not stopping altogether , the current ecocide , and instituting a new-though - ancient attitude of * respect * for the intelligence of nature . no linguist who sincerely wants to understand what * language * is all about can any longer afford to ignore its deeper processes in nature - - natural language , of which human natural language is an important subset . * * * anyone wishing to see how this inclusive approach further includes brainmind research - - the relevant evolution of brain structures and of brainwave rhythms - - can contact me at dalford @ s1 . csuhayward . edu . - - moonhawk ( % - ) ) ( "" the fool on the hill sees the sun going down and ) ( the eyes in his head see the world spinning round "" ) ( - - mccartney / lennon )",Safe Email

default method - From disk"". Any ideas how I can get this thing to boot *my* kernel ? Anyone care to
guess how the cobalt boot process ? Google seems very quiet on the
subject of the cobalt boot process, and what is there doesn't seem to
work. Simple stuff like: (how to boot a different kernel)

Second stage kernel: Decompressing - done
Linux version 2.2.16C28 (konkers@unicron.cobalt.com) Note the descrepancy between what I want to boot, and actually booted.Kate--

of French in primary school and 6 in secondary school. So, that's 9 years of
French. Which, I guess, should be long enough to be fluent in most languages.
As it turns out, my French is crap. My Irish is much better. The problem seems to be the braindead attempt to make people learn languages
they can't speak through reading and writing. And then tacking on speech as
an afterthought. Whereas doing it the other way round would be a lot more
useful...I hear this complaint a lot, but I never hear people complaining about being
""forced"" to learn to read and write, or to do maths. Maybe people don't mind
as much if it is perceived as a useful skill (which Irish is not usually
perceived as).Anyway, tir gan teanga tir gan anam :)Nick--

From: Bert01. I was so poor growing up...  if I wasn't a boy...  I'd have had
    nothing to play with.02. A girl phoned me the other day and said, ""Come on over; nobody's
    home.""  I went over. Nobody was home.03. During sex, my girlfriend always wants to talk to me.  Just the
    other night she called me from a hotel04. One day I came home early from work...  I saw a guy jogging
    naked. I said to the guy, ""Hey buddy, why are you doing that?""  He
    said ""Because you came home early.""05. It's been a rough day. I got up this morning...  put a shirt on
    and button fell off.  I picked up my briefcase, and the handle
    came off.  I'm afraid to go to the bathroom.06. I was such an ugly kid...  When I played in the sandbox, the cat
    kept covering me up.07. I could tell my parents hated me.  My bath toys were a toaster and
    radio.08. I was such an ugly baby...  My mother never breast fed me. She
    told me that she only liked me as a friend.09. I'm so ugly...  My father carries around a picture of the kid who
    came with his wallet.10. When I was born, the doctor came into the waiting room and said to
    my father, ""I'm sorry. We did everything we could, but he pulled
    through.""11. I'm so ugly...  My mother had morning sickness...  AFTER I was
    born.12. I remember the time that I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of
    my finger to my father.  He said he wanted more proof.13. Once when I was lost, I saw a policeman, and asked him to help me
    find my parents. I said to him, ""Do you think we'll ever find
    them?"" He said,""I don't know kid. There's so many places they can
    hide.""14. My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.15. I'm so ugly...  I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how
    big I'd get.16. I went to see my doctor. ""Doctor, every morning when I get up and
    I look in the mirror...  I feel like throwing up; What's wrong
    with me?"" He said...  ""I don't know but your eyesight is perfect.""17. I went to the doctor because I'd swallowed a bottle of sleeping
    pills. My doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.18. With my old man I got no respect. I asked him, ""How can I get my
    kite in the air?"" He told me to run off a cliff.19. Some dog I got. We call him Egypt because in every room he leaves
    a pyramid. His favorite bone is in my arm.  Last night he went on
    the paper four times - three of those times I was reading it.20. One year they wanted to make me poster boy - for birth control.21. My uncle's dying wish was to have me sitting in his lap; he was in
    the electric chair.

IT talent solution
today!I've just got a few quick thoughts today.First, the search is underway for the hosting solution mentioned in Monday's Penguin Shell. The response has been great, with more than two dozen offers of web space for the Foundation for Children and Youth With Diabetes. It gratifying to see our community rally around a great cause. Know that whether you answered the call or not, you're in the electronic company of some caring and compassionate folks. I've not yet heard whether a solution has been found from among the many offered, but I'll certainly keep you posted on the outcome.Second, a few final clarifications on the 4th of July bruhaha. A reader brought to my attention that, though he didn't believe it to be the case, offering my opinion on the state of America could be seen as trolling. That certainly wasn't intended. Also, I've seen much email over the past week that started with, ""Since you published the opinion of someone outside the US, I'd expect that you'll publish an opinion in disagreement."" Well, I did that already - it was my own opinion that started the discussion. I can clearly see the potential for this to get out of hand. So, this will be the last word on the subject. Thanks for your opinions and your discussion, the vast majority of which was well-thought and reasonable. Both sides were presented and we're moving on.On to some Lockergnome news. If you haven't already heard, 
CleverMedia is sponsoring karaoke night at Gnomedex. According to the woman with her finger on the pulse of Gnomedex, Lori Lockwood, ""There is definitely a 'surprise' in the works for the attendees ... "" Hmmm. Could it even compare to last year's Miss Gnomedex contest? I think it unlikely. In any regard, the folks at CleverMedia are certainly more than capable of coming up with loads of fun -- it's what they do for a living! Between Leo Laporte, Doc Searls, Steve Gibson, Mark Thompson, Evan Williams, and too many others to mention, you'd be silly to miss out.Onward. Have a great day.

SPECIAL OFFER for Lockergnome readers,
get your set TODAY, ONLY $29.95!Windows Apps in Linux? - Part III don't want to mince any words, here. CodeWeavers has really hit a sweet spot with their recently-released CrossOver Office product. This is, quite simply, the fulfillment of the promise of the Wine Project. Using this slick little app, virtually all the applications in the Microsoft Office suite are fully functional in Linux. Frankly, I never thought I'd see the day when running Windows apps in Linux was exciting. Maybe it's time to take up shucking ice cubes in the blasted lands.Let's break this product up a bit. If purchased as a bundle, both CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin (as we discussed yesterday) share an install script. They do, however, require separate install processes, so they need to be launched individually from a shared window.I started the CrossOver Office install, dropped my Office 2000 disc in the CD drive, and fired up the install. It looked and performed exactly as you'd expect to see it in Windows. I was able to customize the install, as I always have, then let it run. At the end of the process, CrossOver Office ""fakes"" a Windows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete.Even Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed. There's an option in the CrossOver Office package to install IE 5.5 but, to my chagrin, this was the one area of the install that failed. Actually, the install itself may have succeeded - I was just left without an IE browser following the upgrade. It's hard to tell whether that was a fault in CrossOver Office, or in the IE program itself.For the most part, these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows. The IE install was a bit kludgy, with some font problems and an inability to customize the toolbar. Word worked perfectly, allowing me even to pull together legal documents for a friend's business without so much as a hiccup. Even printing works well with the installation of a ""Wine Postscript Printer"" driver.Let me reiterate something I said yesterday. I've watched the Wine Project walk, then crawl, then walk again over the past few years. I've always suspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent. With the financial backing of CodeWeavers, it appears that my suspicions were well founded. Wine has, through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin, matured to a level of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the spectrum of experience. In the big picture, widespread acceptance of these products could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows users to make the leap to Linux: the loss of Word and Excel. They simply don't need to fear those losses any more.A note on the ""for pay"" structure of these products seems in order. As you well know, I'm an open source guy through and through. But, this is clearly a case in which the ""free"" efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply wasn't enough to close the gap. The value of these products easily outweighs their minimal cost. And, if it keeps these developers moving forward, it seems to be the perfect pay model for Linux.

Kernel Configuration - Part XToday we're looking into the mysteries of Plug and Play support in your Linux kernel configuration.There's really not much mystery to it. This section simply asks the question, ""Do you want plug and play support in the kernel?"" In other words, do you have all the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you'll ever need to have? If you're set solid with your current machine, there's no use to add the overhead of PnP to your system's kernel code, or as a loadable module. If, on the other hand, you've got PCI or (on an older system) ISA slots just begging to be filled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules.See, this kernel gig isn't really so tough. In fairness, we're hitting the high points without a heady discussion of the hidden workings. The discussion of PnP alone could comprise a full series in Penguin Shell. But, so far, the configuration has been pretty straightforward.Tomorrow, we will dive a bit deeper, with a discussion of block device kernel configuration.

( if you > do n't i ' ll say "" i thought not ! "" ) i suppose i ' m taking up benji 's gage , though i want it understood that i ' m very much in sympathy with what he has to say . i remember a little over 10 years ago i was taking a course in lexical phonology , and got into an argument with the prof . because he insisted that one of the co - rollaries of the theory was that ' people ' is inherently plural , which explained the non-existence of the overt plural ' peoples ' . i insisted that the word ' peoples ' certainly does exist and that therefore any theo - retical claim that it does n't was ipso facto falsified . ( cf . rev . vii 9 : ' a great multitude which no one could number , from every nation , from all tribes and * peoples * and languages ' . now , presumably ' people ' in this passage means something like ' ethnic group ' , and is not therefore precisely equivalent to ' people ' meaning ' many persons ' , or ' the set of all human beings ' . i would also note that one common meaning of ' universe ' is ' the set of all existing things ' , which would also imply that the word ' universes ' ought not to exist either , but it does . for one thing , there is a variant usage of ' universe ' which makes it roughly synonymous with ' galaxy ' or ' group of galaxies ' , of which of course there are many . it is also freely used in talking about ' parallel universes ' , etc . ) > from a paedagogical point of view i think it is perfectly legitimate for a linguistics teacher to say , ' here 's a bunch of strings , with attendant grammaticality judgments . what generalizations can we draw from these data ? ' we can save ourselves from the threat of the protest of a student who happens to be fluent in the language under discussion against a gram - maticality judgment by invoking the notion of ' idiolect ' and claiming ' these judgments are an accurate reflection of one particular individu - al 's own linguistic behaviour . what can we deduce about the internalized grammar of that individual ? ' this , of course , assumes that what we as linguists are concerned about is language as a psychological / cognitive phenomenon , and i believe that that is legitimate . but we are also , in my opinion legitimately , concerned about language as a social phenomenon . in which case language is not ( simply ) the property of an individual mind but of a community , and ' gram - maticality judgments ' may be different at the communal level from the individual level . i think as teachers we need to be honest with our stu - dents about this , which means allowing ourselves the luxury of a certain type or level of judgment on one occasion and a different one on another , but as much as possible each time making it clear to our students what level we ' re working at . addressing the broader issues that have come up following joseph stemberger 's posting in linguist 5-1163 , i think we also need to make clear the difference between ' grammaticality ' and ' acceptability ' judg - ments . i have an introductory lecture , prepared for a course i have as yet had no opportunity to teach , in which i attempt to explain that a given string ( e . g . , ' 3 is angry ' or ' my toothbrush is pregnant ' ) may be perfectly grammatical but semantically or pragmatically anomalous , and might be rejected for that reason , while another string ( e . g . , ' tooth - brush my am orange ' or ' there are a rabbit in garden ' ) may be fully in - terpretable and therefore not semantically anomalous but nevertheless violate certain constraints of grammar . i would be inclined to reject any claim that , as georgia green occasionally put it ( facetiously ) in class and elsewhere , ' the rules of grammar must include the rules of arithmetic and all other real-world knowledge ' . thus , if my son were to say , ' the moon is made of green cheese ' i might challenge him on the * content * of his statement , but not on its * con - struction * . dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *",Safe Email

"I'm not sure if this is really a razor problem/issue or a sendmail
problem. Here's the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning
FreeBSD 4.4. Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my
wife's web site with Apache server running on it and a few other
services (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we
get a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On
occasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a
reconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in
which are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see
over 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an
occasion. The machine is then REALLY slow.I noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated
with the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though,
to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor
files. So I have just added ""-home /etc/razor"" as an argument. I
haven't had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether
this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This
paragraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph
above; but I thought I should be complete in my description.)At any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email
processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes?  Is there,
perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?Any ideas would be welcome.Thanks,
Joe

Date: 2002-09-24T10:46:15-05:00- _Phil Ringnalda_: Putting on the brakes[1]. â€œSo, the answer to the 
question that started this whole project, ""what is the RDF in RSS 1.0 good 
for?"" is two things: it's good for someone who has an infinitely large database 
that can be queried infinitely fast by a schema-aware program, or it's good for 
writing a schema-aware aggregator that can try to figure out what it should do 
with new elements that it hasn't seen before. That's actually an interesting 
project with some potential for success, but at this point I'm sick of the 
whole thing, so I'll leave that project for someone else.â€ 
- _Aaron Swartz_: TRAMP: Makes RDF look like Python data structures[2]. 
â€œRDF/XML got you down? Tired of having to go through contortions to deal 
with data? Want to write Python and be standards-compatible at the same time? 
Need a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides? TRAMP may or 
may not be the answer to these problems!â€ Complete with an example of 
parsing FOAF files. 
- _Dan Connolly_: HyperRDF: Using XHTML Authoring Tools with XSLT to produce 
RDF schemas[3]. â€œXML syntax is a little tedious, but lots of people are 
evidently willing and able of editing it by hand. RDF adds another layer of 
tedium, but there are still a few folks willing to write it by hand. I make 
heavy use of reification/quoting in my representation of logical formulas in 
RDF. This adds another layer of tedium that I find unmanageable, and I have 
been writing XML/SGML/HTML by hand for 10 years.â€ Also includes a cogent 
explanation of the obscure profile attribute in HTML. [1] http://philringnalda.com/archives/002330.php

"Ananova:Â  
Brazilian bees keep their own 'insect ranch'Scientists have found a new species of bee that behaves like a farmer by
keeping herds of insects.
The Amazonian Schwarzula use their own 'insect ranches' to provide food and
building materials.
The bees nest in holes in trees alongside 200 aphid-like insects from a
species called cryptostigma.
Cryptostigma feed on tree sap and excrete a sugar solution, which the bees
stop them from drowning in, by licking it up and turning it into honey.
The insects also produce wax from glands on their backs, which the bees
scrape off and use for their nest.
Nature reports it is the first time farming behaviour has been discovered in
bees.
Biologist Joao Camargo, of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said: ""In
turn the bees provide the insects with sanitary benefits and protection.""
Writing in the journal Biotropica, Camargo says the bees might even carry
their insect ranches around the forest with them and is planning further
research on how they tend to their herd.
Studies of the Schwarzula showed the bees seemed to get most of their sugar
from the insect farms. Some bees were seen licking human sweat for salt.

approximation of a non-integer power function. The technique works for input 
values between 0 and 1 and supports large exponents. The presented shader does 
not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend

  beberg@mithral.com--------EPA: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause Cancer
Wed Sep 4, 3:29 AM ET
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press WriterWASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other
sources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection
Agency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.The EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government's
push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines
and diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.While acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of
exposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both
animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer
risk to humans.""It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental
exposure levels"" as well, the report said. ""The potential human health
effects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and
uncertainties are involved.""The report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various
world health agencies and studies in California and is particularly
significant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel
emissions under the Clean Air Act.Some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush
administration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that
would establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a
separate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.EPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with
the tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval,
the EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone
the requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to
meet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.The engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,
although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel
is expected to produce pollution reductions.The EPA's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the
probability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to
diesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when
gauging pollution health concerns.But in this case, the report said, ""the exposure-response data are
considered too uncertain"" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of
cancer risk to an individual.Nevertheless, said the report, the ""totality of evidence from human, animal
and other supporting studies"" suggests that diesel exhaust ""is likely to be
carcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to
environmental exposure.""The report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses
short-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a
""chronic respiratory hazard to humans"" contributing to increased asthma and
other respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for
as much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.Environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs
to be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road
diesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency
expects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust
sources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.Emily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private
environmental organization, said: ""To reduce the public's exposure to
harmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement
clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent
standards for diesel construction and farm equipment.""Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology
Forum, said the EPA's report ""focused on the past,"" whereas ""the future is
clean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times
cleaner than just a dozen years ago.""The report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in
the mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow
turnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.",Safe Email

( sue mara will also be part of the wholesale electricity team ) . steve montovano , who will continue to report to me , will lead a commercial development effort along with dan allegretti . with the elimination of the regional groups , i also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political / legislative needs across the u . s . paul kaufman will lead a small group that will address that need and that will focus on state political support . paul will also take the lead for government affairs in support of corporate development efforts across the u . s . much of the rest of the group remains the same . linda robertson will continue to lead the washington group with sarah novosel , who reports to linda , taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at ferc . amr ibrahim will continue to lead the support of the global assets group and also continue to manage the risk analytics function . maggy huson will take over support of the non - energy business units , which are as follows : global markets , industrial markets , networks , and broadband . rob hemstock will continue to lead the support of enron canada . paul dawson , who heads up government affairs for europe ; sergio assad , who heads up government affairs for south america ; and mike grimes and mark crowther , who head up our asian efforts , will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself . i am also forming a north american leadership group for government affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company . that committee will consist of rob hemstock , maggy huson , amr ibrahim , paul kaufman , harry kingerski , leslie lawner , steve montovano , christi nicolay , sue nord , sarah novosel , linda robertson , jim steffes and myself . we will also continue to have an rcr committee that will consist of maggy huson , harry kingerski , sue nord , linda robertson , jim steffes & myself . finally , i am forming a dynegy / enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of jose bestard , paul dawson , paul kaufman , sue nord , sarah novosel and myself . no organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perfect or permanent . i believe these changes will make us better and more prepared for the future . however , we must be prepared to further adjust as the future unfolds for the company . one final note : i am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through this uncertain and troubled period for the company . we are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our group fundamentally altered , but we must resolve to do our best for each other and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges , for those of us who do remain a part of the new dynegy , reflects the excellence and integrity that has characterized our group . personally , i will do all i can , for as long as i can , to steer the group through this to the very best place possible . your continued dedication and support is very much appreciated . hang in there and thanks .",Safe Email

scientific advisory committees that guide federal policy in areas such
as patients' rights and public health, eliminating some committees
that were coming to conclusions at odds with the president's views and
in other cases replacing members with handpicked choices.

I may be wrong but I think a single select entry field is used
for selecting messages and switching folders. Restricting the entries
to be numeric would break the folder switching functionality, wouldn't
it?My version of MsgChange, not yet updated, has a check    if {$msgid != {}} {
	# Allow null msgid from Msg_ShowWhat, which supplies line instead
	if {$msgid < 0}  return
    } else {
    ...at the start of the procedure which takes care of the single '-' case.
Perhaps the thing to do is for MsgChange to validate a msgid as a
number before continuing.KevinIn message <200208280108.VAA30178@blackcomb.panasas.com>, Brent Welch writes:

Browse or bustThrough daily use I've found that Mozilla and Opera Web browsers beat Internet Explorer because of two features: tabbed windows and built-in pop-up killers. But occasionally I hit a site that has features that don't work or has a messed up layout, so I have to launch IE to view it correctly. In the last couple of years, Web builders have used proprietary code from Microsoft in their sites, which Mozilla and Opera don't support.I used to cover Web building, so I have plenty of insight into the problem. Using current, standard HTML and JavaScript, Web builders can make a Web site do almost anything that you could with Microsoft's proprietary code. The only things they can't do are goofy enhancements such as changing the browser scroll bar colors. To solve this compatibility problem, either Web builders have to take proprietary tags out of their sites or users have to use IE to view them. You can also enhance IE with utilities such as Secure IE to get the kinds of features offered by Mozilla and Opera, giving you the best of both worlds.Who do you think should be solving problems of Web site incompatibility: Web builders, users, or browser manufacturers?

""Doomed. Completely, absolutely, utterly!""
Just about everyone agreed that Audiogalaxy is as dead as Napster.""Each time a file-sharing service is canceled, a bunch of new ones appear.""
But some people always find a silver lining.""I might use a file-sharing service for a lot of things, particularly drivers, fixes, and patches.""
A P2P network offering drivers seems like a great idea to me.""I was an occasional Audiogalaxy participant (birthday CD burned to include songs that were hits the year you were born). Now I'll just opt for a birthday card and a bottle of wine.""
I included this comment because I really like the birthday idea.""It seems once again rather than release a file download site for music, at a fee per download, the music companies spend money on trying to stop download sites like Audiogalaxy.""
With its popularity, file swapping should be an amazing opportunity for record companies, but they must not be smart enough to figure out how to make it work.

with the definitions, then I'd have to say that I myself am a
genetically engineered organism.  But I'm natural, baby.  My parents
were attracted to each other's phenotypes, mixed some genes in the
hopes that those genotypes would get in there, and grew me around
them.  Sure, they engineered the process when they selected each
other.  But they didn't engineer the genetics.  If genetic enginering
wasn't such an important topic today, it wouldn't be such an important
distinction.I guess that the reason that I disagree is that some groups arguing
against any checks on genetic engineering use that same argument -

caution today"".--

After installing packages one by one and removing some old stuff and
whatnot, the original gnome-session from there suddenly no longer
wanted parted and all that. Go figure.> Also Gaim doesn't work with GNOME 2.0 just yet?If you strip out the gnome stuff, it still runs as a Gtk app without the
applet. Maybe you can even leave in the old panel and all that but I
think some files will conflict and have to be overridden with
--replace-files (dangerous). I just rebuilt gaim and made a few changes
to the .spec adding --without-gnome to %configure or such. It might be
nice to separate the panel version from the actual program like debian
does.Also, bubblemon no longer compiled for me and Yelp had some broken
dependency there.--

"" enron makes the market . make no mistake about that , "" said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey . "" there ' s not a trader out there that doesn ' t use enrononline . "" as such , enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company ' s credit - worthiness is critical . enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday . the company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid . enron said its new chief financial officer is jeffrey mcmahon , the 40 - year - old head of the company ' s industrial - markets division . his selection may be intended , in part , to raise the company ' s credibility . people familiar with the matter say mr . mcmahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about mr . fastow ' s role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with enron . internal partnership documents indicate mr . fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships . mr . fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in july in the face of increasing conflict - of - interest concerns being expressed by wall street analysts and major enron investors . on monday , enron announced that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the fastow - related transactions . while enron as recently as tuesday strongly defended mr . fastow , as well as the company ' s dealings with the partnerships , controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive ' s departure . "" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , "" said chairman and chief executive kenneth lay in a prepared statement . enron said mr . fastow "" will be on a leave of absence from the company . "" he couldn ' t be reached for comment . it remains to be seen how much mr . fastow ' s removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community . the action came after the 4 p . m . market close and followed a day in which enron ' s stock once again plunged . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares were at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 , or 17 % . it topped the big board ' s most active list at nearly 76 million shares , more than twice the volume of the second - most - active stock . several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800 , 000 shares or more , possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on enron stock . enron ' s shares are down about 50 % from the beginning of last week . earlier this year , the stock was above $ 80 a share . in an apparent ripple effect , the stocks of other energy - trading companies , which do business with enron , also fell sharply yesterday . for instance , dynegy inc . shares on the big board were off $ 5 . 45 , or 13 % , at $ 37 . 26 . a number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than enron ' s , which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles . prudential securities analyst carol coale said mr . fastow ' s departure could be seen as evidence that "" management does care "" about investor concerns . however , she adds , the move also could be viewed by some investors , coming as it did two days after the announcement of the sec inquiry , as "" an admission of guilt . "" ms . coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on enron largely because of uncertainties about the company ' s extremely complex financial structure . enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its fastow - related dealings . worries and rumors about enron ' s financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday . goldman sachs analyst david fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible "" death spiral "" in which increasing credit concerns about enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company , which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions . mr . fleischer , a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company , said he hasn ' t yet seen any evidence of such a problem . however , mr . fleischer said , enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities . enron is facing a problem with "" trust and credibility . it ' s not easy to regain something as basic as trust , "" he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c enron ousts finance chief as s . e . c . looks at dealings by floyd norris 10 / 25 / 2001 the new york times page 2 , column 5 c . 2001 new york times company the enron corporation , its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence , yesterday ousted its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron has drawn the scrutiny of the securities and exchange commission . ' ' in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as c . f . o . , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said in a statement announcing the change . only one day before , mr . lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the enron board ' ' continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy . ' ' the company said that mr . fastow had taken a leave of absence , but it also named his successor , jeffrey mcmahon , the head of enron ' s industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer . enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night . the move came after the close of trading on the new york stock exchange , where enron ' s shares fell $ 3 . 38 , to $ 16 . 41 . the price has been cut in half since oct . 16 , when enron reported its third - quarter earnings . a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that mr . fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release . mr . lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed , but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $ 1 billion write - off that was disclosed in the earnings document , and were angered when they later learned about it . on tuesday , when both mr . fastow and mr . lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call , neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by mr . fastow . mr . lay cited the s . e . c . inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions . the fact the transactions took place has been known for a year , but enron ' s disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand . by structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver enron stock , it appears that enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses , but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement . that is one of the issues the s . e . c . , whose inquiries were disclosed monday by the company , is expected to address . concerns have also grown this week over whether enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying - - either in cash or with stock - - if things went wrong . on tuesday , mr . fastow assured investors that the company ' ' expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations , ' ' and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate . mr . fastow was viewed as one of the architects , with jeffrey k . skilling , the former enron chief executive who resigned in august , of the change in business strategy that turned enron from a gas - pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large wall street following . its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $ 90 . 75 . according to a person close to the company , while mr . mcmahon , mr . fastow ' s successor , was enron ' s treasurer , he told mr . skilling , who at the time was the chief operating officer , that he thought the partnerships involving mr . fastow presented a conflict of interest . after that discussion , mr . mcmahon moved to a different job at the company , this person said . shares of enron traded as low as $ 15 . 51 yesterday afternoon , the lowest price for the stock since early 1995 , before recovering . in after - hours trading , they fell to $ 16 . 14 . one of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by m . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , to drop her rating to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' hold . ' ' she had lowered the rating to ' ' hold ' ' from ' ' buy ' ' on monday . ' ' after the s . e . c . inquiry was announced , ' ' she said in an interview yesterday evening , ' ' enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat , as a gesture to the street . now they are replacing him today . the timing is a little late , but i think it will be received positively by the street . ' ' but she said that investor sentiment might work the other way . ' ' people could fear that if you remove fastow from the management team , you ' ll never get any answers .

"" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , "" enron chairman and ceo ken lay said in a statement after the stock market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares . enron , which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons , found itself high on wall street ' s hit list after it released third - quarter earnings on oct 16 . the earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at : fastow , with the approval of enron ' s board , had formed and run two investment partnerships - - ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . the partnerships , which did complex financing and hedging deals with enron , served as a source of funding for enron projects and investments . but wall street questioned how fastow could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time . so fastow , in june , resigned his roles at the partnerships and enron also ended its relationships with the ljm entities . during the third - quarter , enron took a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . tuesday , lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously followed to ensure the interests of enron and its shareholders were protected in dealings with the ljm partnerships . he said a "" chinese wall "" existed between enron and ljm . fastow ' s replacement , mcmahon , previously served as enron ' s treasurer before moving last year to another job with enron . most recently , he headed up the company ' s industrial markets group . a source close to enron said mcmahon asked to be reassigned from the treasurer ' s job because he was uncomfortable with the fastow - ljm setup . enron spokesman mark palmer said neither fastow nor mcmahon was available for comment wednesday . he also didn ' t know whether fastow is still receiving a salary . enron disclosed on monday that federal securities regulators had begun an "" informal inquiry "" into the ljm dealings . the news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications , water and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of ceo jeff skilling in august for personal reasons . a continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against enron followed the earnings report and the news of the sec inquiry . wall street has stepped up its chronic complaints that enron ' s various financial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give analysts enough data to make proper evaluations . beyond the ljm partnerships , investors are concerned about two other partnerships enron set up . among the worries is that enron will end up having to issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities . investors wouldn ' t like that because it would dilute the value of current outstanding shares . they are also afraid that enron ' s debt credit rating may be downgraded , which could have negative impacts on its overall business . in the last six days , enron ' s shares have closed lower and lower . on oct . 16 , the stock closed at $ 33 . 84 . on wednesday it closed at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 . wednesday , the hubbub surrounding enron also dragged down shares in other companies that engage in energy trading , including houston - based dynegy , which closed down $ 5 . 45 at $ 37 . 26 . there is concern enron ' s woes could in some way end up harming the energy trading markets . a conference call lay and senior executives , including fastow , held with analysts tuesday to help clear up questions didn ' t go as enron hoped . on wednesday , carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston , moved from a "" hold "" to a "" sell "" rating . front page -

first section - enron replaces finance chief - energy company attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price . enron , the us energy group , yesterday replaced its embattled chief financial officer , andrew fastow , to try to halt a slide in its share price , which has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week . kenneth lay , enron ' s chief executive officer , said after the market closed that mr fastow was taking a leave of absence . the move came a day after mr lay defended mr fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partnerships that had forced enron to take a $ 1 . 2 bn write - off . that loss , revealed last week , sparked the share sell - off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come . enron disclosed the loss during an october 16 conference call with analysts on its third - quarter results , saying the charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that enron had set up in the partnerships established with mr fastow . analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained , leading to confusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . "" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , "" mr lay said . he said jeff mcmahon , chairman and chief executive of enron ' s industrial markets group , would replace mr fastow . mr mcmahon earlier served as enron ' s treasurer . analysts said it was unclear whether mr fastow ' s departure would be enough . carol coale , of prudential securities , said the move was positive in demonstrating that enron was being sensitive to wall street , which had called for mr fastow to be replaced . yet , she added , it came three days after those calls . ms coale issued a "" sell "" recommendation on enron earlier yesterday , leading to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price . "" we are concerned about what we don ' t know , "" ms coale said . she was concerned that enron might have to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating , or be forced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet . enron might also lose customers to competitors that were not under such pressure . enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the sec inquiry will prove the company has done nothing wrong . lex , page 16 .

' ' on a recent conference call ` ` no one thought they did themselves any favor in terms of calming investors ' concerns . ' ' ` ` they were slightly hiding behind the fact that the sec has got this inquiry going . the fact that two days later andy is gone , and he was in the center , is a good sign that the company is realizing just how concerned investors are . ' ' ` ` there ' s always that worry once the sec gets involved that it could extend . you never know what could come of that . ' ' ` ` there is a bit of fear of the unknown about enron now , with the sec inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset write - downs . ' ' ` ` another thing they ' re criticized for is their lack of disclosure . we still haven ' t seen a balance sheet for the third quarter . ' ' ` ` people are saying , why don ' t you include a balance sheet with your results ? they promised better disclosure in the past and that was meant to begin in the third quarter . ' ' ` ` you ' d like to see just more information on asset write - downs and a discussion of their off - balance - sheet financing - - all these vehicles they have like marlin and osprey . ' ' ` ` we ' d like to see some clarity , answering those sort of questions . ' ' ` ` it seems as though enron at least are maybe at the start of a process where they ' re going to address and clean up their balance sheet and they ' ve started to replace management . ' ' ` ` investors have already had enough issues ' ' in corporate bonds recently and ` ` sometimes investors just think , ` not another nasty in my portfolio , ' and i ' d rather exit . ' ' ` ` for certain investors maybe they just get scared . i wanted to know more about it . people had speculated if it could go to junk . i don ' t think they could because i don ' t think enron could exist as a junk company . ' ' ` ` there ' s a certain reluctance ' ' to sell the bonds . ` ` you want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals . ' ' ` ` when the spreads have already moved out that wide you have to reassess and see whether you think it ' s a buying opportunity .

"" it could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concern or it could be interpreted as if enron removed the cfo at the request of the sec , "" prudential securities inc . analyst carol coale said wednesday .

"" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , "" enron chief executive officer kenneth lay said after markets closed wednesday . fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while jeff mcmahon , who has served as chairman and chief executive of enron ' s industrial markets group , takes over his role . "" i think change is good at this particular point in time , "" said fac equities analyst robert christensen said . "" i think andy was somewhat beleaguered . "" a . g . edwards & sons analyst mike heim , however , said it will take more than replacing fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty looming in the financial world about enron and its partnerships . "" i think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last few days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements , "" heim said . replacing fastow alone won ' t clarify those arrangements , he added . "" there is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more transparent to the financial community , "" heim said . "" instead of being more transparent there is more confusion than ever . "" enron ' s stock continued to plummet wednesday , closing down $ 3 . 38 to $ 16 . 41 per share , a 17 percent decline . since the wall street journal first reported on the partnerships last week , enron ' s stock price has slid nearly 52 percent .

"" this is really the first time enron has acted as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis . "" previously , enron ' s managers have been "" cautious and defensive in their approach , "" he said . during a conference call tuesday to address investor concern , lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no conflict existed as fastow carried out the dual roles . the partnerships have since been dissolved . the call didn ' t work for many , including feygin and heim . "" i didn ' t hear things like we ' ve unrolled all these partnership dealings or here ' s all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don ' t ever expect to take any more charges , "" heim said . "" what i heard is we don ' t have to disclose that information until the 10 - q is filed . "" the turbulent past few months which have included the sec inquiry , third quarter losses and the august resignation of the company ' s chief executive officer , jeff skilling , have left many analysts questioning the company ' s future , heim said . "" it ' s really a speculative bet right now , but the odds favor the company being able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year from now , two years from now , "" he said . but much is going to depend on how much enron discloses to its investors , feygin said . feygin said mcmahon worked as enron ' s treasurer for two years under fastow before a disagreement over fastow ' s involvement in the partnerships caused mcmahon to leave his job as treasurer . "" internally , jeff was always a proponent of andy not being involved in ( the partnerships ) , "" feygin said .

2000 dow jones a press release says fastow is taking a leave of absence . he ' s been replaced by jeffrey mcmahon , formerly ceo of enron ' s industrial markets group . how might the enron bulls spin this ? likely , they will point to mcmahon ' s alleged opposition to fastow ' s role in the big hedging deal , called ljm 2 , to show that the "" fastow era "" is over . the wall street journal , citing anonymous sources , reported tuesday that as treasurer at enron mcmahon complained about fastow ' s possible conflict of interest . probably , the fear was that fastow couldn ' t serve enron and ljm 2 equally , especially as he was allegedly making a lot of money from ljm 2 . clearly , if mcmahon turns out to be a new broom , that ' s a positive for enron . an enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the journal ' s account of mcmahon ' s stance on ljm 2 was correct . not much else is encouraging , however . fastow ' s departure shows that it took massive drops in enron stock to force senior management into action . on a difficult conference call tuesday , ceo ken lay gave fastow resounding backing . it took wednesday ' s plunge to get lay to sign off on a new cfo . in other words , lay listens only when the market screams and hollers . how much further does the stock have to fall to bring further much - needed reforms at the company ? the spokeswoman responds that lay had discussions with analysts tuesday and wednesday that led him to the conclusion that fastow ' s replacement was necessary to rebuild investor confidence . enron culture is thick with financial sorcery . people got upset by one shadowy deal , but no one knows exactly how the company ' s core energy trading business makes money . it ' s hard to believe the ljm 2 deals were done in isolation and without the knowledge of the board . in fact , the chatter is that fastow and former ceo jeff skilling proposed the ljm 2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband business . the board apparently feared the volatility that might come from being in broadband , so fastow allegedly proposed ljm 2 as a way to hedge that volatility away . this meant ljm 2 entered agreements that gave it access to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected enron from the downside . should the whole board be on the hook , too ? the spokeswoman responds that the board would not have entered the ljm 2 transaction if it had not thought it would benefit enron and its shareholders . lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market ' s views . arguably , that ' s downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish short - term financing . letting things get this bad has risked good faith among enron counterparties and bankers . it shows an unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they ' re unavoidable . the spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency . any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated , but is it any wonder people compare this lot to long term capital management ?

dramatic increase in CO2 concentrations are not increasing the global
temperature. They would also need to explain why, worldwide, glaciers are
melting faster than they have previously in the historical record. That is,
people need more than refutations, they need a compelling alternate

"802.11b - 11Mbps per channel over three channels in the 2.4GHz range 
(also shared with microwaves and cordless phones) at rages up to ~300 ft.
802.11a runs on 12 channels in the 5GHz range and up to around five 
times more bandwidth (~54Mbps or so) but has less range (60-100 ft). 
8021.11a also adds Forward Error Correction into the scheme to allow for 
more reliable data transmission.
Which to use really depends on what you're doing with it. Streaming 
video almost necessitates 802.11a, while streaming just audio can be 
comfortably done with 802.11b provided that there isn't much 
interference or too many clients.
Prices? Don't know... Haven't done the research. For covering a large 
area 802.11a will be more expensive due to the need for more APs. If you 
want to reach the local coffee shop, however, you will need a 
directional antenna either way.Check out http://www.80211-planet.com, they've got some good articles on 
802.11... Also, some of the best info on 802.11 security I've seen can 
be found at http://www.drizzle.com/~aboba/IEEE/.
Give me bandwidth or give me death,

crashing into the Ottawa skies /every/ /single/ /night/, and that's
just the background noise.  Plots of that data show us passing through
hundreds of 'tubes' of debris, each indicative of some other larger
something out there, only a small handful of which have been
discovered.  This is without even considering the one's headed this
way out of the Oort for their First Big Trip.One thing you will just have to get used to is hearing news of a
possible collision; we have only started funding the projects to look
for these things since Hollywood took an interest with Armageddon, and
we have only just recently turned on a bunch of new toys to do
automated sky surveys.  There are also some new (and very clever)
amateur projects co-ordinating multiple telescopes to detect these
criters, one of which plans to network dozens of ground based machines
around the world.  You may remember a few years back the 2028 doomsday
story -- consider them good ghost stories, then go back to work.20,000 years ago, one of them the size of Mt Everest just ever so
slightly grazed us and left a scar 400km long in the side of South
America before it scooted out into space.  First nations people would
have been there then, and it would have seriously ruined their day.
Orbital elements tell us that our modern technology would have perhaps
given us 90-min advance warning.   The near-miss earlier this month wasn't seen until it was already past
us; we can't detect rocks on their trip behind the Sun, and when they
come out slingshot to relativistic speeds, well, it's just too darn
late to do much of anything about it.  On the inbound trip, even at
their max full-moon angle, these things are most often magnitude 16 or
way worse, which is many magnitudes fainter than what you see in the
deepest dark-skies; no one thought to paint them shiny and white.
They day before it ""hits"" my software says NT7 will be magnitude 14 --
it's easier to see the space station.What's worse, the Sun is not a smooth hard spheric marble, it's a
twisted gelatinous hunk o' hunk o' burnin' love, so the precise warp
curve of space right near it's backside is (ahem) somewhat problematic
to compute precisely.  It's also spewing considerable plasma flux in
all directions, and then there's all these other big gelatinous roaming
globs (Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune) and some significant roaming
rubble (us), and damn it, they are all spinning too, and most of them
have a magnetosphere!Shit. Forget it.Learn to play the banjo. Take peppermint Rye-Kee Shee-At-Zoo relaxation
therapy and oodles of Ag-nasial I&I-drop suppliments, eat no kind of
frozen portion, and floss.  Good planets are real hard to find, so
enjoy the one you got while it's here.  Call your ma. Do an anonymous
kindness for your better half, another for a total stranger. Having
all the best toys is useless when they all spontaneously combust from
a global Wormwood shockwave. You should be diggin' it while it's
happenin'Like, just live your life like there's no tomorrow, ok?  Don't bank on
being able to redeem yourself later. Yeah, sure, Osama could whack you
with some nail-coated fuel-air bombs, heck a mis-informed TopGun could
do it too, but the Good Lord could do it too, with pure, clean and
galactically EnviroFriendly kinetic energy, and He don't stand in line
for no Airport Security Check. Hell, fire and brimstone are
classically given in the reverse order; best to be on the impact side
of the planet.Learn to stop worrying and love the Rock.  Besides, the rats and
cockroaches will survive, and they already know how to kickstart
evolution right back into Enrons, WorldComs and Calcuttas.  They even
have all our wiring and plumbing diagrams and half of our socks.Are we going to get hit?  Yup.  When?  Every 65 million years and, oh my lord, will you /look/ at the time!Where/what/when? Space is pretty big.  Take the largest thing you can
imagine, double it, and add 10%: That is just the local pancake region
between us and the Sun. There's the whole rest of the disk of the
ecliptic and, which is where the NT7 observation came from, it has
only recently occurred to the meteor hunters to ""look up"" (or down);
almost the first shot looking /out/ of the ecliptic disk, and hoo-whee
there's this big sucker on an ""11 tries for a dollar"" close encounter
of the smack-em-good kind.This is what I love about astrophysics: we have theories as good as
anyone else (way better than psychology), and we debate and argue and
expound and conference and bellow and blurt about them, but every time
we turn on some new kind of robot sensor device to actually /look/ at
Reality, well she slaps us right in the face and says in her best Mae
West ""Guess again, boys"" -- no other science gets that chance (ok,
maybe some do) and there is nothing, _nothing_ more worthless than last

" ilug , From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,
          Johannesburg,South Africa.My Dear ,Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and !
confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's!
 regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.Best Regards, Mr.Michael Kamah and family.

Hash: SHA1Thugs of South Boston and The Revenge of the Bandit Princess
The Geodesic Economy
Robert A. Hettinga
Sunday, August 25, 2002(BOSTON) When you think about it one way, the FBI/Winter Hill vs.
Patriarcha/Angiulo Cosa Nostra fight was just another race war
between thugs.Put crudely, and at its most racist, the FBI and the Winter Hill Gang
were the (mostly) Irish thugs, and Patriarcha's ""family"" were, of
course, the (mostly) Italian thugs.
Think Scorsese's upcoming ""Gangs of New York"", only with
counter-reformatory overtones. Hoover's South Boston ""social-club""
putsch, starting in the mid 1960's, was particularly audacious in
hindsight. The U.S. Federal Government actually decided to underwrite
a reversal of the prohibition-era capture of the nation's rackets by
the Italians from the Irish. The fact that the plot was hatched not
for New York, but for South Boston, the most Irish place in the US,
only makes even more gigantic the Big Lie that was told by the FBI to
its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime
there once and for all.The result, as we all found out, wasn't swapping the heroin of
Italian Boston mob violence for Irish methadone. Hoover was,
posthumously, swapping it for Oxycontin, or crystal methamphetamine
- -- or, more properly, PCP. The absolute psychopathology of violence
in Whitey Bulger's crack-cocaine-era reign of Boston's drug markets,
like the identical FBI-sponsored reigns or violent horror by other
also-rans in cities across the US as a whole, went up whole orders of
magnitude, not mere percentage points.As Stalin said once, quantity has a quality all it's own. And, make
no mistake, J. Edgar Hoover was directly responsible that ""quality""
of carnage, nation-wide.
So, yes, on paper at least, it really *was* just the swapping of one
gang of racist thugs for another, and the result was, on paper, at
least, business as usual. Same stuff, different century, with
apparently decent people like Mr. Salvati et.al accidently ground on
the gears of ""justice"" like so much hamburger.However, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was
""greasing"", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could
love: a perfectly functioning market, legislated out of existence --
on paper, if nowhere else -- by government fiat and the, back-door,
but still elitist, will to power of H.L. Mencken's famous ""bluenoses
and busybodies"".
It all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent of
beginnings. What she couldn't do to alcohol, teatotaling Mrs. Grundy
then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a
smaller, ""manageable"" demand. The bloody result was, like nine more
heads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition,
in more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on.Every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, or
harmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic -- or, now,
apparently, fattening -- and then prohibited, exactly the same thing
happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the Volstead
years. A *larger* market than before the prohibition. Hugely
lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently
scale newly-legislated ""barriers to competition"" imposed on them by
the state. Increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of
those substances. And, finally, the ultimate in evil -- the kind of
evil this country actually fought wars to end -- increasingly
coercive axe-handle beatings, by our own government, of the sacred
liberty of the average, but now unavoidably-law-breaking, citizenry.As Ayn Rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don't need
government if nobody's breaking the law. In some twisted corollary to
Parkinson's Law, governments, to survive, *need* more people,
breaking more laws, or they can never justify the money they
confiscate at tax time.And, to bring us back to the point, David Friedman would probably
echo here his father Milton's famous observation that government
regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, and
never the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. Even,
*especially*, if those sellers are *breaking* the law, as they are in
the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our
government now imposes on us.
And there, absent the apparent grace of Mr. Hoover, went Mr. Salvati.In fact, Hayek himself, in ""The Road to Serfdom"", couldn't have
predicted any better the gory consequences of Hoover's blatant
imposition, ""for our own good"", of Vietnam-era statist power at the
neighborhood level. And, furthermore, *Stalin* couldn't have had
better ""useful idiots"" than Hoover did -- and neither, by an
absolutely literal extension, did Whitey Bulger after Hoover.Useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. Idiots who
were eating out of Hoover's power-craven hand for the entire middle
of the 20th century -- and Whitey Bulger's hand, whether they knew it
or not, until the end of the millennium. A time, you'll notice, which
saw the increasingly steady imposition of ""mob"" violence, and market
control, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond the
imaginings of even the most power-mad, rum-running, stock-kiting,
movie-flopping, bureau-pumping, Nazi-appeasing Irish-Bostonian Little
Caesar. Or, as for that matter, his safely trust-funded, and now
strictly political, descendents.In terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to Mr.
Salvati and the others, dead or alive, as a ""transfer-price"", in
human lives, of the inevitable consequence of MacNamara-style
Vietnam-era Keynesian ""social-cost"" input-output accounting at its
most despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that
was committed by Hoover, and his co-religionists in state economic
control, in the name of what really was, as you'll now agree, just a
race war between thugs up in Boston.
This shouldn't be a surprise, really. All race wars are at least
fought by thugs, though they're usually conceived elsewhere, and
endorsed, at the time, by all the ""right"" people, for all the ""right""
reasons.As far as the FBI itself goes, remember Mancur Olson's observation
that a ""prince"" is just a stationary bandit.Though, given his penchant for women's clothing, for other men, and,
what's actually obscene, for violently hypocritical treatment of
people of his own affectional preference, I suppose we can call J.
Edgar Hoover a bandit ""princess"", instead.""Bandit Queen"", of course, would be a grievous insult to queens --
and real bandits -- everywhere.Cheers,

Hoover's F.B.I. and the Mafia: Case of Bad Bedfellows Grows By FOX
BUTTERFIELDBOSTON, Aug. 24 - It was March 1965, in the early days of J. Edgar
Hoover's war against the Mafia. F.B.I. agents, say Congressional
investigators, eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of
New England's organized-crime boss, Raymond Patriarca.Two gangsters, Joseph Barboza and Vincent Flemmi, wanted Mr.
Patriarca's permission to kill a small-time hoodlum, Edward Deegan,
""as they were having a problem with him,"" according to an F.B.I. log
of the conversation. ""Patriarca ultimately furnished this O.K.,"" the
F.B.I. reported, and three days later Mr. Deegan turned up dead in an
alley, shot six times.It was an extraordinary situation: The Federal Bureau of
Investigation had evidence ahead of time that two well-known
gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the New England
Mafia was involved.But when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the real
killers - who also happened to be informers for the F.B.I. - were
left alone. Four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced to
death or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothing
to do with it.One, Joseph Salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice with
the Justice Department last week that he planned to sue the F.B.I.
for $300 million for false imprisonment.His is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the F.B.I., the
Justice Department and some F.B.I. agents growing out of the tangled,
corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the F.B.I.'s Boston
office in its effort to bring down the mob.The lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years
in a judicial hearing and a Justice Department inquiry. But some of
the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light,
including documents detailing conversation in which Mr. Patriarca
approved the murder. They were released as part of an investigation
by the House Committee on Government Reform, which has pressured the
department into turning over records about the F.B.I in Boston.The documents show that officials at F.B.I. headquarters, apparently
including Mr. Hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that Boston agents
were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were
protecting them from prosecution.""J. Edgar Hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal
himself,"" said Vincent Garo, Mr. Salvati's lawyer. ""He allowed a
witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect
one of his informants.""Mr. Barboza was a crucial witness at trial against Mr. Salvati and
may have implicated him because Mr. Salvati owed $400 to a loan shark
who worked for Mr. Barboza.Asked about the documents showing that Mr. Hoover knew of Mr.
Salvati's innocence when he was put on trial, Gail Marcinkiewicz, a
spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Boston, declined to comment, citing the
pending litigation.A Justice Department task force is continuing to investigate
misconduct in the Boston office. In one of the first results of the
investigation, one retired agent, John J. Connolly, is awaiting
sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and
obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were
F.B.I. informers, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi. Vincent and
Stephen Flemmi are brothers.The Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton,
Republican of Indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the Boston
office to headquarters in Washington revealing the bureau's knowledge
that Vincent Flemmi and Mr. Barboza were involved in killing Mr.
Deegan. A memorandum a week after the killing described the crime,
including who fired the first shot.Then, on June 4, 1965, Mr. Hoover's office demanded to know what
progress was being made in developing Vincent Flemmi as an informer.In a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the Boston
office said that Mr. Flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot
wounds but because of his connections to Mr. Patriarca ""potentially
could be an excellent informant.""The agent also informed Mr. Hoover that Mr. Flemmi was known to have
killed seven men, ""and, from all indications, he is going to continue
to commit murder."" Nevertheless, the agent said, ""the informant's
potential outweighs the risk involved.""A Congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. ""The most
frightening part is that after being warned about Flemmi's murders,
the director does not even respond,"" the investigator said. ""There is
no message not to use a murderer as a government informant.""The origin of the corruption scandal was public and political
pressure on Mr. Hoover to move more forcefully against the growing
power of the Mafia, which he had largely ignored. In Boston, F.B.I.
agents recruited Mr. Barboza and Mr. Flemmi and developed close ties
to a rival criminal organization, the Winter Hill Gang, led by Mr.
Bulger.Both sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations and
the trial of Mr. Connolly. The F.B.I. got information that eventually
helped destroy the Patriarca and Angiulo families, which controlled
organized crime in New England. Mr. Bulger's gang was able to take
over the rackets in Boston, sell drugs and even commit murder while
the F.B.I. looked the other way.One reason the F.B.I. may not have used its information about Mr.
Patriarca's involvement in the Deegan murder, Congressional
investigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening device
in his Providence, R.I., headquarters. The F.B.I. agent who
transcribed the conversation made it appear that the information was
coming from unnamed informants, to disguise the use of the device,
the investigators say.Mr. Salvati, a former truck driver, now 69, had his sentence commuted
in 1997 by Gov. William F. Weld. Last year, while he was still on
parole, his murder conviction was dismissed by a Massachusetts state
judge after the Justice Department task force made public documents
suggesting his innocence.Two of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison. Their
survivors have joined the fourth man, Peter Limone, in a $375 million
lawsuit against the Justice Department. Mr. Limone was sentenced to
die in the electric chair. His life was spared only when
Massachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974.Mr. Salvati lives in a modest apartment in Boston's North End with
his wife, Marie, who visited him in prison every week during those 30
years. Each week Mr. Salvati sent her a romantic card, which she put
on the television set. It was, Mr. Garo said, all they had of each
other.-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

    Ya know, I was thinking the same thing.  But there's at least two main 'opposing thumbs' between regedit and gconf:    1. GConf is written in English, not symbol tables; you can actually READ what the heck you're looking at.    2. Because it's better-considered, it should be more sound; when the registry gets a wrong value, you may not be able to boot....if GConf is scrogged, you can still have all the underlying power of the OS to keep things running....just call up WindowMaker (or whatever) for the next session until you get it worked out.    It took me a while to warm up to it...but I *do* like Gconf...------------------------------------------------------------------------

"company spotlight > > ( otc : sbgx ) here ' s another company to put on your radar , another one from the same source that alerted us to : cyad , tftg which all doubled . stonebridge resources exploration ltd . ( otc : sbgx . pk ) current price : $ 0 . 41 equity structure freetrading 20 , 000 , 000 sharesfloat 3 , 000 , 000 shares overviewstonebridge resources exploration ltd . ( nasd pink : sbgx ) , is a nevada corporation listed on the nasdaq pink sheets . the company is focused on resource acquisition and development for interests located primarily in canada and the united states . the company has begun an intensive campaign to acquire and develop high value base metals , gold and rare earth bearing properties . the company has a strategy to acquire a large number of high value properties and begin development of them commencing immediately . the initial target acquisitions all have very high potential for moving into production and produce substantial income and profits . a private funding group has agreed to finance acquisition and development of the initial properties under friendly terms which involve a working interest in the properties and equity in the company . value resources has a highly talented management group with many years of experience in resource property development . the target portfolio of initial acquisition candidates has a diverse and robust mix of deposits , some of very high value . one target acquisition , for example , has a large deposit of scandium . scandium is a very expensive rare earth material which has been used by the russian materials industry in alloy with aluminum to coat the surface of aircraft . currently there is no scandium mined in the free world , and the property that stonebridge plans to develop contains large reserves of scandium and titanium . the company plans to develop properties with many diverse resources such as copper , gold , zinc , talc , platinum and palladium amongst others . stonebridge has an initial plan to acquire at least ten and as many as twenty valuable mining properties within a very short timeframe . in the next several months sbgx plans to control at least a dozen high - value mining properties with the potential to bring in many millions of dollars of profit to the company . the exact extent of the potential revenues is as yet undermined because , although most of the candidate properties have known reserves , more exploration and drilling needs to be conducted in order to determine the minimum value of the mining operations once acquisition is complete . even after exploration , the potential exists to uncover undiscovered reserves with the potential to multiply the known value of the candidate acquisitions . one target acquisition is about 10 kilometers southwest of timmins , ontario . the property already has indicated probable reserves of 100 , 000 ounces with grades of 0 . 3 ounces per ton . this medium grade ore in large volume constitutes a substantial deposit . exploration is ongoing at the site and the company already has a joint venture partner lined up for development once the acquisition is completed . the company has a strategy to develop properties in joint ventures with large mining interests . this strategy allows the company to leverage its capital and proceed with development quickly on all properties simultaneously . the company has at least ten gold bearing sites under review for acquisition at this time . resources is building a large and well funded mining concern with substantial acquisition properties in various stages of development . the strategy of developing diverse properties with various types of rare earth , gold and mineral deposits insures that there is robust and lasting value built into the company . moreover the chances of uncovering greater value as development continues increases as the variety and extent of the deposits become fully known . stonebridge plans to develop these properties and get them into production as soon as possible . the company is well funded by investors who care for the long - term viability of the company and who will act in the best interests of the shareholders . gmcr expects that stonebridge will realize sizeable profits of many millions of dollars from the development of these initial candidate properties . moreover , gmcr expects that the company will continue to expand through acquisition and become a major mining concern throughout north america . press release stonebridge signs loi to acquire 50 % interest in mining claims of 6070205 canada inc . friday april 29 , 4 : 01 pm et carson city , nev . - - ( business wire ) - - april 29 , 2005 - - stonebridge resources explorations ltd . ( nqb : sbgx - news ) , has entered into a letter of intent with 6070205 canada inc . to acquire 50 % interest in the mining claims of their property in northern ontario , 15 km n . w . of kirkland lake . the property was explored previously by a number of companies and previous drilling indicated geology finds that are favorable for a potential large sulphite deposit . the initial drilling done in 1998 indicated zinc mineralization in a number of drill holes , varying from 0 . 6 meters of 4 . 4 % zinc and 1 . 76 % zinc over 4 . 6 meters , 1 . 33 % zinc over 4 meters . in the year 2002 a megatem airborne survey was conducted over the property identifying several areas of interest . a confirmation of the geophysical result from the airborne survey was obtained by a ground geophysical survey that identified the down plunge extension of the previous drilling . it was recommended that a 3 drill hole program for a total of 500 meters be undertaken . harold pizel , stonebridge resources president , said ; "" this agreement signed once again shows our strong belief and commitment to the mineral rich northern ontario region , we are excited about the opportunities ahead .

"about this: A bored FoRKer said: ""YAWN""I believe Tom had it right. Signal not noise.I'll start: Los Angeles Times September 23, 2002 Monday Copyright 2002 / Los Angeles Times Los Angeles TimesSeptember 23, 2002 Monday Home Edition SECTION: Main News Main News; Part 1; Page 13; National Desk LENGTH: 1013 words BYLINE: DANA CALVO, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SEATTLEBODY:The idea came at the end of a long, frustrating brown-bag session at a public-policy think tank here.The challenge was to save the city's child-care programs. Staring into his empty coffee cup, the meeting coordinator's mind landed on an unlikely solution: Put a tax--just a ""benign"" dime a shot--on espresso.That led to a petition signed by more than 20,000 Seattle residents, and next year, voters will decide whether the tax becomes law, one that taps right into Seattle's legendary addiction to coffee. This is, after all, the town where Starbucks was born and where the $12 pound of beans became a staple. There is one Starbucks for every 7,000 residents in Seattle, compared to one per 64,000 in New York. Seattle also has two other major coffee chains, Tully's Coffee and Seattle's Best Coffee, as well as countless cafes and espresso carts.A recent poll showed that 74% of Seattle residents would vote for the tax. ""For people outside of Seattle who don't understand the consumption of espresso, [the tax proposal] can be seen as crazy,"" said John Burbank, the think tank's executive director, ""but it was common sense.""Research by his nonprofit Economic Opportunity Institute showed that people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso. But because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax on espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol.Burbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million a year. City Council aides dispute his figures, saying their research shows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year.Burbank's institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. The think tank's mission is to promote public policy in the interests of low-income people, and it has long championed child-care issues.Burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child-care programs made earlier this year by Gov. Gary Locke. He also says it would provide more low-income families with subsidies for child care, improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries.At Bauhaus Books & Coffee, the sidewalk is dotted with tables of customers for whom coffee is a half-day activity, not just a drink.Espresso lovers like Chris Altman, who at a dime a day would spend an extra $36.50 a year, said the investment is worth it. ""I'm OK with it,"" said the 35-year-old, stirring his iced latte. ""The money's got to come from somewhere.""Hope Revuelto, 25, was cooling her regular coffee ($1 because she brought her own mug) and reading ""Zen and the Art of Pottery."" She supports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be expected of espresso drinkers: They want the most expensive thing on the menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy.Some say the tax isn't the issue; they just resent being singled out.David Marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos a day, which means he'd be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. ""I, for one, don't have kids, but I drink espresso,"" he said, as he sewed a leather collar onto a chain-mail tunic. ""I don't mind paying, but I think everyone should pay.""Coffeehouses are steamed about it, and they've organized as JOLT--Joined to Oppose the Latte Tax. Among the members are Seattle's Chamber of Commerce and the city's two largest coffee franchises, Starbucks and Tully's.The tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that contains espresso, a task that could be an administrative nightmare for smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning rush. If espresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners could face a city audit.University of Chicago economics professor Michael Greenstone said the tax doesn't add up. ""The purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this is neither,"" he said. ""On the efficiency side, it's surely going to lead to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to avoid the tax. For example, Starbucks could claim that they are using finely ground coffee, [instead of coffee run though an espresso maker] and that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. Would they be right? I don't know, but finding out will surely take lots of legal fees that could have gone to child care.""Of course, from a public-relations perspective, this is an ingenious idea, and I mean that in a cynical way. They've pitted espresso drinkers against child-care supporters, and who's going to side with the espresso drinkers?""In fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political two-step, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public stance of political correctness. In a liberal city like Seattle, corporations continually advertise their commitment to social activism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, JOLT members prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care.""Starbucks will continue to support early-learning and childhood-development programs through the millions of dollars we contribute annually,"" the company said. ""However, Starbucks does not understand why the Economic Opportunity Institute would recommend an additional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other single consumer product.""The City Council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before voters next year. The initiative's authors say it is directed at vendors; critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through higher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee. The tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of espresso, including decaf. Drip coffee would be exempt.Burbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. So, he's been pitching it as a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the needy get a dime every time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso.It's the kind of political marketing that Fran Beulah, 43, finds funny. ""I drink espresso,"" she said, laughing, ""and I am not rich.""

"6 . 351 language policy frank ashen focussed on the divisive effects of promoting one of several indigenous languages to the position of official language and used the much quoted justification that speakers of not-chosen languages may feel disadvantaged . he did not mention the effect of the introduction of a foreign world language on the vernaculars . the introduction of foreign official language has , in africa , led to explicit negative attitudes amongst the speakers themselves towards their languages . the alternative to the selection of an indigenous language as official language seems to be to disadvantage the whole population . in most african countries the foreign official language generally has a very low penetration so that only the elite know it . knowledge of the official language then becomes a new factor that determines access to power and the well-paid jobs . at the same time the vernaculars are ignored or stigmatised . this means that no or very little funds are available for their development and teaching . this means , to come back to tove skutnabb - kangas ' comments , that the population cannot exercise their "" right to learn their mother tongue , both orally and in writing , up to a high level . "" the assumption that frank ashen quotes is based on a false departure point , namely that only a colonial language can save an african country from being torn up by its own internal divisions . i do n't recall any wars based on language differences prior to colonisation . africa solved its linguistic diversity by developing lingua francas . djit ? recently ( 1993 ) showed that the use of so-called international languages such as english and french have not solved the communication problems of the african masses but in many cases contributed towards the "" pathology of linguistic bakwardness "" . the fact that these languages ( such as wolof , swahili , hausa , lingala ) are actually spreading - without much official help - seems to indicate "" a general willingness for cooperation and a cultural and linguistic tolerance that ignores the political boundaries inherited from colonization "" djit ? ( 1993 : 162 ) . spencer ( 1985 : 395 ) claims that the introduction of european languages to africa retarded the spread of what he calls "" african vehicular languages "" . however , adegbija ( 1994 : 26-27 ) is sceptical of the ability of african lingua francas of being accepted outside their present geographical domains . he also warns against the imposition of these languages . it would seem that we need a three-language policy such as that of india : one language for communication with the outside world known by a relatively small section of the population ; one lingua franca for national and regional communication and the various vernaculars for local business and primary education . in many african countries this is the de facto situation and trilingualism is more common in africa than outside linguists seem to realise . this suggestion might avoid the subtractive language learning ( that characterises many african communities ) and that tove skutnabb - kangas finds "" a violation of minorities ' linguistic rights "" . the sources that i referred to : adegbija , e . 1994 language attitudes in africa : a sociolinguistic overview . clevedon : multilingual matters . djit ? , p . g . 1993 "" language development in africa .

ugly!

"industry giants can ' t match this opportunity another ground breaking news alert from rlyc . the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts . one company is quickly entering a $ 2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi - national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching . in just a few months , this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long - term customers that could generate tremendous re - occurring revenues for many years to come . although you have probably never heard of this company , you may soon hear of it even if you don ' t continue reading this message . that ' s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u . s . within the next year . an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry in reality , this company ' s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you . since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don ' t know this company or what they plan to accomplish , their stock is trading at rock bottom prices . but , if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years , this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments . the company that we ' ll introduce you to today is ( relay capital corp . pink sheets : rlyc ) . rlyc , which recently went public , is a multi - faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market . rlyc ' s present product and service offerings include pre - paid stored - value cards , reward cards , employee payroll cards , gift , retail and affinity group cards , travel cards and funds transfer cards . these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally . just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn ' t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner . in order to be successful , that company also needs to be truly innovative , have very strong partners , be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality . rlyc appears to be that company . below we ' ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition . the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts . stored - value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e - commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities . the implications reverberate across industry segments . estimates suggest stored - value transactions could exceed $ 2 trillion in just a few years . rlyc ' s focus is on providing stored - value cards to the un - banked and under - banked . these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account , debit card . the size of that group is staggering that ' s about one - third of the nation ' s work force ! rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored - value card programs that make it easy , fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored - value cards as well as for the un - banked and under - banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards . but that ' s not all . the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships . in this segment , relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer . who wouldn ' t want that ? the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc for the under - and un - banked , collecting their pay , cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming . rlyc ' s stored - value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem . rlyc ' s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un - banked alike ! lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u . s . cards , cards in foreign countries , and services bought through the cards , improved employee retention , improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc . various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system , while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms . rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards earlier this year , rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc ( click to go to their site ) , a leader in providing technical , craft and administrative staffing services to businesses , industry and government through locations in houston , dallas , long island , orlando , phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un - and under - banked populations . the potential market for this service is really big . it includes large employers , companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers . this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing , cutting , and mailing paper payroll checks . it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay , eliminate lost checks , stop payments and minimize fraud . but best of all , this should help to significantly boost rlyc ' s revenues . $ 150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries mexicans in u . s . send $ 16 . 3 billion a year back to mexico with $ 150 billion being transferred internationally each year , remittances are a really big business . in times past , people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices . many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union . more recently , more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances . the problems with traditional money transfer methods with wire services , there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas . first , wiring funds across borders can be expensive . this can make it very cost - prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service . next there is the problem of logistics . both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company ' s services . even if they both are able to do this , the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them . lastly , the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose . these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives . so , even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money , it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use . with money orders there is always the problem of mail service . although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service , this is not always the case in foreign countries . this is especially true in underdeveloped nations , where most remittances are sent . a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive . and , there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all , meaning that the sender ' s family could go hungry or end up on the streets . what is the best way to send remittances ? by far the most convenient , fast , safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored - value card . with this type of service , a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account ( onto the card ) via loading station , telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country . the process is extremely easy and cost -

 Dear Readers,Your ISP, if it's anything like mine, works like a very large
boat: It moves slowly, it turns slowly, and sometimes it leaks.
Take rogue wireless networks, for example. For many months now,
some mischievous entrepreneurs have been hacking into major ISP
networks and siphoning off bandwidth for neighborhood wireless
networks. Only now, months later, are broadband bigwigs doing
something about it. And what
about ISP hackers? Could they break into your service provider?
Probably. Thankfully, you can protect yourself against most of
these leaks. Let Dan Tynan, our ISP guru, show you how. Quick links to Services & Prices from these companies

This week in Internet ServicesBig broadband providers are ticked off about Wi-Fi hot spots.
In fact, both AT&T Broadband and Time Warner Cable have begun
campaigns to stop subscribers from sharing their accounts with
others at no charge. Also this week: we review Yahoo""s new
dial-up service.
Is your ISP safe from hackers?Surely, the folks who run your ISP have thought good and hard
about security issues, but should you count on their skills to
ward off intruders? Not wise, says our ISP expert. In this
week""s column, Dan Tynan takes security matters into his own
hands and shows you how to protect yourself.Domain namesA domain name provides an online identity and contact point for
your business, organization, or project. Almost every transaction
on the Internet relies upon a domain name to conduct commerce,

"far as I can remember, the fact that the IPID is zero was introduced into 2.4 was to introduce correct behaviour, i.e. in the case where it is not needed, it is set to zero. This was discussed on bugtraq a while ago....lemme see... http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/archive/bugtraq/2002/03/msg00372.html shows a message from nmap's author on the subject. The only thing having IPID==0 achieves is that you have one more criteria on which to base your OS fingerprint which isn't really much of a problem to be honest.Stop worrying about it :)Cheers, jr ----- Original Message ----- From: ""Paul O'Neil"" To: Sent: Monday, July 22, 2002 1:50 PM Subject: [ILUG] nmap results > I had posted previously about the 2.4 kernel using iptables I ran nmap > against.

"california update 6 / 5 / 01 executive summary ? edison ' s mou condemned at this friday ' s cpuc meeting ? the idle plan z ? angelides hides state budget concerns ? house committee to vote on energy relief edison ' s mou doubtful the unusually calm settling over the california legislature about socal edison ' s potential bankruptcy has finally affected the relentlessly optimistic investment bank analysts and other company shareholders . we have reported that through all plans from b - z , there is not a solid plan to save this company and now executives are even more fearful that this predictions may come to fruition . over the last few days , edison executives have begun pointing hard at the cpuc meeting this friday as a make - or - break event for the company . the is because after the meeting , davis ' s mou plan to buy socal ' s grid will have no chance of preventing a potential bankruptcy . this plan is essentially dead although governor daivs has yet to say this in a press releases . the final nail will happen after the cpuc adjourns its friday meeting without voting on several necessary mou provisions . unless the cpuc makes a last minute , emergency - amendment to their agenda , the deal will be dead ( despite socal ' s support for letting the deal stand past its deadline ) . sources indicate that cpuc president loretta lynch holds reservations on the mou and continues to distance herself from davis . attempting to influence policy making , edison executives have spent the last few investor phone conferences warning that june 8 would see substantially increased risks for a creditor - induced bankruptcy if the davis plan dies at cpuc . this is interesting , since no one else seems to have been focused on the date until edison began mentioning it late last week . however , there is no more or less threat of bankruptcy than there is now or will be in two weeks . as reported several times earlier , most everyone had given up on the mou long before this friday ' s cpuc meeting . plan z shows little progress meanwhile , the unhurried pace toward a plan z that we reported last friday , has gained little progress . legislators continue to pin - point a plan that will secure re - election votes and at the same time , weigh the need for rate hikes for california ' s corporate and home electricity users . as they hash it out , the state is spending even more on electricity purchases . in spite of better than expected levels of conservation , the state ' s electricity expenditures over the last month rose to an average of $ 79 m / day . the recent rate increases mean more spending by the state and that calls into question the reassuring angelides scenario for california ' s budget prospects later this year . the california budget crunch even more worrisome than a idle plan z is increasing evidence that last month ' s conference call with state treasurer angelides was a little misleading . during that conference call angelides claimed that state comptroller connell and many in the financial committee had the numbers wrong . angelides argued that $ 7 . 2 b already spent to buy power since january was really the total amount of authorized spending through late august . in fact , he said only $ 4 . 3 b of that had been "" spent . "" sources now indicate that angelides was technically correct if you use "" spent "" to mean only the amount of money for which checks had been written . this is different than the amount of money california had already promised to energy suppliers who had already supplied energy to the state . in fact , when angelides was speaking the state had in fact already promised to pay $ 7 b for energy it had already consumed ( the total committed has topped $ 8 b . ) by the time the state gets its "" power bonds "" auctioned in august , they will have already spent all $ 12 b and be back to dipping into the general fund . the idea of rans being auctioned before the power bonds get issued is still an option if the general fund doesn ' t make it to august . the nearest answer to both of these cash flow deficits lies in part in the painful process that the legislature is undertaking now - another round of huge electricity rate hikes to securitize debt issuance . then the hope is that those hikes bridge the gap between now and when new capacity brings wholesale rates down and the debts can be repaid . the only near term path to bringing generating assets on line immediately is the 3 , 500 mw from qf plants which are off line because of cash flow problems . settling their needs is wrapped up in settling the pg & e and edison trade creditor issues , which makes the legislature ' s leisurely approach to the rate hike / haircut situation all the more troublesome . energy relief the house energy & commerce committee is scheduled to vote on h . r . 1647 ( the emergency electricity relief act ) tomorrow at 10 : 00 am . the bill which was twice postponed and does not include any provisions on price caps , but during the course of the mark - up , sources indicate that it is possible , even likely , that a democrat could offer a price cap amendment . rep . waxman ( d - ca ) offered a price cap amendment at an earlier mark - up of the bill at the subcommittee level . the waxman amendment was rejected along party lines ( all republicans and 2 democrats voted nay ) . sources inside joe barton ' s office report that staff and members have been meeting to work out a compromise on the price cap issue , but nothing has been resolved . as of this afternoon , those discussions have been terminated in favor of an open discourse in the committee tomorrow . since an agreement was not reached , compromise language is not expected to be offered as an amendment tomorrow . if it is , it would not be something that leaders on the republican and democrat sides have crafted together and therefore would not likely pass . sources indicate that the committee does expect waxman , and possibly others to offer price cap language , but it is not expected to pass .",Safe Email

"hot penny piay on strong breakout the oi | and gas advisory now that oil and gas has entered a | ong - term buil market , our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining undervaiued energy piays has produced soaring returns . emerson oil and gas ( eogi ) is an energy developer in the us "" oi | belt "" and in canada ' s most highly coveted reservoirs with generating potentia | of miliions per week . breaking news ! ! ! emerson oi | and gas , inc . , ( eogi ) is pieased to announce that the alberta energy & utility board has issued license no . 033 o 206 for the company ' s we | | 11 - 16 - 24 - 2 the acadia project . the acadia project consists of 15 sections in alberta in an area that produces natura | gas from the viking formation , has oil potentia | in the bakken zone and gas potential in the colony and second white specks zones . the viking contains natura | gas in weils around the acadia project and has the potential for 13 bcf gas in the reservoir under the | eases . gas we | | s in the area have caicuiated aof rates up to 14 mmcf per day . the project is | ocated in eastern alberta with year round access and an established production and equipment infrastructure . we | | costs are expected to be $ 6 oo , ooo drilied , cased and compieted and the advanced funds will go towards the dri | | ing of the first we | | . each we | | on a lease earns emerson a 49 % working interest in one section . emerson oil and gas , inc . , ( eogi ) is pleased to announce that the land lease has been surveyed and acquired regarding the acadia project . the acadia project consists of 15 sections in alberta in an area that produces natura | gas from the viking formation , has oi | potentia | in the bakken zone and gas potentia | in the colony and second white specks zones . the viking contains natural gas in we | | s around the acadia project and has the potential for 13 bcf gas in the reservoir under the | eases . gas wells in the area have caicuiated aof rates up to 14 mmcf per day . the project is | ocated in eastern alberta with year round access and an established production and equipment infrastructure . wel | costs are expected to be $ 6 oo , 0 oo dri | | ed , cased and completed and the advanced funds wi | | go towards the driliing of the first wel | . each we | | on a | ease earns emerson a 49 % working interest in one section . symbo | - eogi price - . 026 the vaiue of eogi ' s shares wiil skyrocket : 1 . price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu | | market in a generation . 2 . natura | gas prices have tripied in the last two years . 3 . with muitipie projects in high - gear and the expanding production on reserves worth multi - miliions , eogi is seliing for less than 1 / 4 the value of its assets . 4 . emerson oil and gas specializes in using new technology to turn unproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises . aiready shares in the oi | and gas sector are rising faster than the overall market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized expiorers and deveiopers like emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are being made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple returns . our subscribers need to pay particuiariy ciose attention to undervaiued eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for | ong . this sma | | company with a comparabiy smal | market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oi | and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especiaily with the daily jump in energy prices . but al | that wiil change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move into production , bringing an expiosion of cash that is expected to capture the attention of the market , and have an equa | | y explosive effect on the share price . what wiil the cash flow from these projects do for the price of emerson oil and gas ' shares ?

"calculating bid - ask prices this is about enron movie trading business where we are a market maker for trading future of a movie ' s gross box office receipt . rich sent to many people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide some feedback . i think the idea ( see below ) might be applicable to other parts of enron . we can call it "" dynamic bid - ask price process "" . in fact , we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is submitted to the system within a specified amount of time . the final ( clearing ) bid and ask prices are just the last "" tentative "" price shown to the public before the bidding period ends .

"Hi Niall,Some thoughts...o Run the ssh client with verbosity 3 (ssh -v -v -v)
o Run an sshd with debugging level three (sshd -d -d -d)
o ~alfio doesn't seem to be nfs-mounted like ~alfred(The following aren't really applicable, but...
    o Has alfred been logged in for ages? Has the tmpsweeper swept
      through /tmp removing alfred's ssh-agent directory in its wake?
    o Is /tmp a+rwxt? Does /dev/null exist?
    o Has alfred been messing with his TMPDIR envar?
    o What does lsof on his ssh-agent say? What about on alfio's?
    o What are the permissions on ~alfred and ~alfred/.ssh?
    o Does alfred's uid conflict with somebody else's?
    o Does alfred's $SSH_AGENT_PID correspond to his agent? alfio's?

"I'm sure that The Beatles are weel happy with Microserfs for robbing them
blind of their ""intellectual Property""I'm gonna mail complaints@microsoft.com and get them to put an end to these
windows cd's ;--)Don't suppose you have a reference for it? I've made a lot of friends in the
MS complaints department, its amazing what you can say to them and get away
with it --::)))CWAnd no sorry I don't know the solution, they must be pretty bad quality
though if you can fit 25 albums on one CD. I would say they are Mpeg encoded
or some buzz like that. ---------------------
I've got some really interesting wav files here.A friend had a Windows CD with, wait for it . . .Every Beatles Record ever released in the U.K.! Including the Christmas and 
BBC special albums! All on one, ordinary CD! Yes a 650M CD!Of course this CD also had a special Windows app for playing this
collection!I had a look at the contents of the CD, since I don't do Windows, and the 
albums appeared to be plain wav files? Each album in it's own wav file, 25 
Albums, 25 wav files?!? I copied the wav files to my hard drive. Curious thing, though, noatun crashes on some of the larger ones, seems to 
attempt to load the entire file into memory first, and on the ones it
doesn't 
crash on, it plays them fast and noisily? kwave refuses to recognise them 
completely and wavp just makes an ungodly noise!xanim can, and does play them correctly though. Unfortunately xanim does nothave any position control so you just have to listen to the album from startto finish.file has this to say about them:johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ file beatles/SGT.WAV
beatles/SGT.WAV: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft ADPCM, 
stereo 22050 Hz
johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ ls -l beatles/SGT.WAV
-r-xr-xr-x    1 johngay  johngay  53334900 Sep 27  2001 beatles/SGT.WAVAnd this is SGT Pepper's lonely Hearts Club Band album. 51M is quite good, 
considering it also has the inner track. But they certainly are NOT in
stereo.What I would like to do is split up the tracks and convert them the mp3 for 
xmms. I'm jsut not sure what tools would be able to handle these strange 
compressed wav's that only xanim seems to recognise? I like the albums, but 
would prefer to be able to sellect tracks to play rather than entire albums 
and be able to listen to all my music with one app. I know xmms has a WAV 
plugin, but it does not recognise these either.Any help will be greatly appreciated!Cheers,	John Gay

"The Electronic Telegraph Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham
 or sick of Sheffield.
 
 Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey
 this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps
 heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.
 
 Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied
 with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to
 emigrate to provincial Russia.
 
 After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek
 article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other
 side.
 
 ""The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city
 deep in the provinces where things are quiet,"" said Kommersant.
 
 ""In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly
 cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are
 becoming 'traditionally' relaxed.""
 
 The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of
 tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.
 
 It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the
 famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also
 opening time in the nation's vodka shops.
 
 And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that
 ""the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be
 enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their
 life.
 
 ""The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle
 of whisky for kopecks.""
 
 There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a
 halfpenny in sterling.
 
 The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton
 will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine
 vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among
 diehard alcoholics.
 
 While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The
 newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail
 soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British
 settler should overcome the difficulty.
 
 ""For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut
 off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle.""
 
 One or two potential emigrÃ©s might be deterred by language difficulties. There
 are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the
 Mongolian border.
 
 However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a
 deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in
 which they would like to live.
 
 France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country ""where English is only known
 by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists"".
 
 Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian
 weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.
 
 Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.
 And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place
 in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures
 that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the
 permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.
 
 Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the
 climatic problems, it said that ""thanks to global warming this difficulty will
 solve itself"".
 
 Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in
 Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.
 
 ""Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33
 million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found
 amongst our citizens.""
 
 Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons
 surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their
 preferred new home.

II. BUGTRAQ SUMMARY
-------------------
1. OpenSSL SSLv2 Malformed Client Key Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5363
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5363
Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported in some versions of
OpenSSL.When initiating an OpenSSL session, some information is shared between the
client and the server, including key data. The reported vulnerability lies
in the handling of the client key value during the negotiation of the
SSLv2 protocol.A malicious client may exploit this vulnerability by transmitting a
malformed key to the vulnerable server. Careful exploitation may result in
execution of arbitrary code as the server process, and the attacker
gaining local access to the vulnerable system. More primitive attacks may
result in the server process crashing, possibly producing a denial of
service condition.The consequences of exploitation may vary with the nature of the
application using OpenSSL.Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.2. Abyss Web Server HTTP GET Request Directory Contents Disclosure Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5345
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5345
Summary:Abyss Web Server is a freely available personal web server. It is
maintained by Aprelium Technologies and runs on Microsoft Windows
operating systems, as well as Linux.A vulnerability has been reported for Abyss Web Server 1.0.3 running on a
Microsoft Windows platform. It is possible for an attacker to make a
request such that the contents of the specified directory are revealed.The vulnerability occurs due to the manner in which excessive '/'
characters are handled in web requests. An attacker making a GET request
followed by 256 '/' characters will cause Abyss Web Server to return an
error page containing the directory listing of the specified directory.An attacker may be able to use this information to launch further,
potentially damaging attacks, against a vulnerable system.3. DotProject User Cookie Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5347
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5347
Summary:dotproject is web-based project management software, written in PHP.  It
is designed to run on Unix and Linux variants.dotproject is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to bypass
authentication and gain administrative access to the software.This may be accomplished by submitting a maliciously crafted 'user_cookie'
value either manually or via manipulation of URI parameters.  For example,
the attacker may manually craft a cookie with a 'user_cookie' value of 1
and submit it to the project management system.  An attacker may also
submit a malicious web request with the 'user_cookie' URI parameter set to
1.  In both instances, the attacker will gain administrative access to the
project management system.This problem is due to the software relying on the 'user_cookie' value to
authenticate the user.4. OpenSSL SSLv3 Session ID Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5362
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5362
Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.A vulnerability has been reported for OpenSSL. The vulnerability affects
SSLv3 session IDs.When initiating contact with SSLv3 servers, clients and servers alike
exchange information. Session information is stored in a session key with
a unique session ID.Reportedly when a an oversized SSL version 3 session ID is supplied to a
client from a malicious server, it is possible to overflow a buffer on the
remote system. This could result in key memory areas on the vulnerable,
remote system being overwritten, including stack frame data.An attacker may be able to take advantage of this vulnerability to execute
malicious code on a vulnerable SSLv3 client machine.Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.5. phpBB2 Gender Mod Remote SQL Injection Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5342
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5342
Summary:phpBB2 is an open-source web forum application that is written in PHP and
backended by a number of database products. It will run on most Unix and
Linux variants, as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems.Gender Mod is a modification for phpBB2 which allows the association of a
gender with a given user profile. A SQL injection vulnerability has been
reported in this mod.A malicious user may modify the specified value for 'gender' when updating
their profile. It is possible to include additional SQL statements in this
string, and subvert the SQL statement used to update the user profile.It has been reported possible to gain administrative access to the phpBB2
site through exploitation of this issue. Other attacks may be possible,
including the ability to view sensitive database information or to modify
additional information stored in the database.6. ShoutBox Form Field HTML Injection Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5354
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5354
Summary:shoutBOX is web-based user feedback software.  It is written in PHP and
runs on Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows operating
systems.ShoutBox does not sufficiently sanitize HTML tags from input supplied via
form fields.  In particular, the user website URL field of the feedback
form is not sanitized of HTML tags.Attackers may exploit this lack of input validation to inject arbitrary
HTML and script code into pages that are generated by the script.  This
may result in execution of attacker-supplied code in the web client of a
user who visits such a page.  HTML and script code will be executed in the
security context of the site hosting the software.This condition may be exploited to hijack web content or potentially steal
cookie-based authentication credentials.7. Sympoll File Disclosure Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5360
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5360
Summary:Sympoll is web-based voting booth software.  It is implemented in PHP and
will run on most Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows
operating systems.Sympoll is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to disclose
the contents of arbitrary webserver readable files.  This vulnerability is
only present on hosts which are running the vulnerable version of the
software and have the PHP 'register_globals' directive enabled.  The
source of this vulnerability is reported to be insufficient integrity
checking of variables.The vendor has stated that this issue is only believed to affect Sympoll
version 1.2.Exploitation of this issue on Microsoft Windows operating systems may
potentially expose arbitrary system files since webservers typically run
in the SYSTEM context.8. OpenSSL ASN.1 Parsing Error Denial Of Service Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5366

by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc..  It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.A remotely exploitable denial of service condition has been reported in
the OpenSSL ASN.1 library.This vulnerability is due to parsing errors and affects SSL, TLS, S/MIME,
PKCS#7 and certificate creation routines.  In particular, malformed
certificate encodings could cause a denial of service to server and client
implementations which depend on OpenSSL.Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.9. William Deich Super SysLog Format String Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5367
Remote: No
Date Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5367
Summary:super is an open source set-uid root utility that allows for a similar
functionality to that of the sudo utility. It is written for use on Linux
and Unix variant operating systems.super is prone to a format string vulnerability. This problem is due to
incorrect use of the syslog() function to log error messages. It is
possible to corrupt memory by passing format strings through the
vulnerable logging function. This may potentially be exploited to
overwrite arbitrary locations in memory with attacker-specified values.The vulnerability is a result of compiling super with syslog support. Due
to an error in the file, error.c, users that are not in the super
configuration file will still be able to execute code with root
privileges.Successful exploitation of this issue may allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary instructions with root privileges.10. Frederic Tyndiuk Eupload Plain Text Password Storage Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5369
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5369
Summary:Frederic Tyndiuk Eupload is a small script designed to facilitate
uploading of files to a remote server. It is written in Perl and should
work with Microsoft Windows and Linux and Unix variant operating systems.A problem with Eupload 1.0 may make it possible for remote attackers to
gain access to sensitive information.Eupload does not cryptographically protect stored passwords. Passwords
contained in the configuration file, password.txt, are stored in plain
text. They may be read by simply viewing the file. The file, password.txt,
is stored in a web accessible location and is, itself, accessible for
retrieval. Thus it is trivial for an attacker to obtain user passwords and
abuse the Eupload service.This problem could allow an attacker to gain access to the passwords to
protected resources.11. Util-linux File Locking Race Condition Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5344
Remote: No
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5344
Summary:The util-linux package is a set of commonly used system utilities such as
'chfn' and 'chsh'.  It is included with many Linux distributions.A race condition has been reported in code shared by the util-linux
utilities.  The condition is related to file locking.  Failure to check
for the existence of a lockfile prior to sensitive operations may, under
specific circumstances, open a window of opportunity for attack.  The
util-linux utilities often write to sensitive files such as /etc/passwd/.
Attackers may exploit the condition to inject arbitrary data into these
files to elevate privileges.The reported attacks are complex, time dependent and require specific
circumstances such as system administrator interaction and a large passwd
file.Red Hat Linux is known to ship with util-linux as a core component.
Other distributions, those that are derived from Red Hat in particular,
may also be vulnerable.It should be noted that the utilities included with the shadow-utils
package (shipped with SuSE Linux) are not vulnerable.12. OpenSSL Kerberos Enabled SSLv3 Master Key Exchange Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5361
Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.A vulnerability has been reported for OpenSSL 0.9.7 pre-release versions.This vulnerability is present only when Kerberos is enabled for a system
using SSL version 3.When initiatiating contact between a SSLv3 server, master keys are
exchanged between the client and the server. When an oversized master key
is supplied to a SSL version 3 server by a malicious client, it may cause
a buffer to overflow on the vulnerable system. As a result, stack memory
on the vulnerable server will become corrupted. This could enable the
attacker to take control of the SSLv3 server process and cause it to
execute malicious, attacker supplied code.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.13. OpenSSL ASCII Representation Of Integers Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5364
Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol.  It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc..  It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.Remotely exploitable buffer overflow conditions have been reported in
OpenSSL.  This issue is due to insufficient checking of bounds with
regards to ASCII representations of integers on 64 bit platforms.  It is
possible to overflow these buffers on a vulnerable system if overly large
values are submitted by a malicious attacker.Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the vulnerable application, service or client.Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5370
Summary:ParaChat is a web-based chatting system.  It is available for most Unix
and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems.ParaChat chat servers are prone to a denial of service condition.If a user has left the webpage for a chat room using the Back or Forward
buttons of their browser in lieu of logging out, their account will still
be logged into the chat room until it times out 15 minutes later.  A
malicious user may do this repeatedly as different users to overload the
chat server with ""phantom"" users.  A denial of service may be the result.15. OpenSSH Trojan Horse Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5374
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Aug 01 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5374
Summary:OpenSSH is a freely available implementation of the SSH client-server
protocol. It is distributed and maintained by the OpenSSH team.Reportedly, the server hosting openssh, ftp.openbsd.org, was compromised
recently. It has been reported that the intruder made modifications to the
source code of openssh to include trojan horse code. Downloads of the
openssh source code from ftp.openbsd.org between July 30, 2002 and July
31, 2002 likely contain the trojan code.The trojan code appears to be included in the file, bf-test.c. Reports say
that the trojan will run once upon compilation of openssh. The trojan
process is named 'sh' or the compiling user's default shell. Once executed
the trojan attempts to connect to 203.62.158.32 on port 6667. The trojan
will then wait for one of three commands. A connection to the specified
address is attempted once every hour.'D' will cause the trojan to execute '/bin/sh'. 'M' will cause the trojan
to respawn and 'A' will terminate the trojan process. It is highly
probable that this trojan will give remote root access to vulnerable
systems.The following sites also have been reported to carry the trojaned version of openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz:
ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/
ftp://ftp.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/
ftp://ftp1.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/It is not known whether other sites are affected as well.FreeBSD has reported the following MD5 checksum information. The following
is the MD5 checksum of the trojaned version of openssh: MD5
(openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 3ac9bc346d736b4a51d676faa2a08a57The following is the MD5 checksum of openssh in the FreeBSD ports
directory: MD5 (openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 459c1d0262e939d6432f193c7a4ba8a8Note that a different checksum does not mean the backdoor does not exist.*** The OpenSSH team has released an advisory. Fixed versions of openssh
are available for download since 1300 UTC August 1, 2002. The following
MD5 checksum information was provided for fixed versions of openssh:MD5 (openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 459c1d0262e939d6432f193c7a4ba8a8

Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5375
Summary:Gallery is an open source web based photo album. It is written in PHP and
is available for Linux and Unix variant as well as Microsoft Windows
operating systems.Gallery is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to include
arbitrary files located on remote servers. This issue is present in the
following PHP script files provided with Gallery: errors/configmode.php
errors/needinit.php errors/reconfigure.php errors/unconfigured.php
captionator.phpAn attacker may exploit this by supplying a path to a file, 'init.php', on
a remote host as a value for the 'GALLERY_BASEDIR' parameter.If the remote file is a PHP script, this may allow for execution of
attacker-supplied PHP code with the privileges of the webserver.
Successful exploitation may provide local access to the attacker.17. John G. Myers MUnpack Malformed MIME Encoded Message Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5385
Remote: No

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5385
Summary:John G. Myers mpack/munpack is a pair of utilities to encode and decode
MIME format email. Versions are available for Linux and Unix variant
operating systems as well as Microsoft DOS.A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported for munpack 1.5.
Reportedly, it is possible to cause munpack to crash when it receives a
malformed email or NNTP news article.As this vulnerability is the result of a buffer overflow condition, it may
be possible for an attacker to cause munpack to execute malicious attacker
supplied code. This has not, however, been confirmed.18. Dispair Remote Command Execution Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5392
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5392
Summary:Dispair is a web-based .tar.gz archive viewer.  It is written in Perl and
is available for Linux and Unix operating systems.Dispair fails to sufficiently validate user-supplied input before it is
passed to the shell via the Perl open() function.  A remote attacker may
exploit this condition by injecting arbitrary commands into CGI parameters
in a request to the vulnerable script.The result of successful exploitation is that attackers may potentially
exploit this issue to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying shell
with the privileges of the webserver process.19. Mailreader Session Hijacking Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5393
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Aug 02 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5393
Summary:Mailreader is an open source project which allows POP3 mail access through
a web interface. Mailreader is implemented in Perl, and should work under
Microsoft Windows, Linux and other Unix based operating systems.A vulnerability has been reported in some versions of Mailreader. It may
be possible for a remote attacker to hijack the session of a legitimate
user of the system. This may result in access to sensitive information, or
the ability to send mail and otherwise function as the legitimate user.Full exploit details are not available. It is possible that this
vulnerability results from session information being tracked through CGI
parameters, which may be trivially spoofed by a remote user. This
possibility has not, however, been confirmed.20. John G. Myers MPack/MUnpack Malformed Filename Vulnerability

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5386
Summary:John G. Myers mpack/munpack is a pair of utilities to encode and decode
MIME format email. Versions are available for Linux and Unix variant
operating systems as well as Microsoft DOS.A vulnerability has been reported for mpack/munpack 1.5. Reportedly, it is
possible to cause munpack to create files outside of a designated
directory. When mpack/munpack receives a MIME encoded message with an
attachment that refers to a file, using a '../' sequence followed by the
filename, it may decode the attachment outside of a designated directory.The impact of this vulnerability is limited as it has been reported that
munpack will only accept a single '../' sequence and will not overwrite
any existing files.21. Fake Identd Client Query Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5351
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5351
Summary:Fake Identd is an open source Ident server designed to return the same
information to all incoming requests. It is implemented by Tomi Ollila,
and available for Linux and a number of other Unix based operating
systems.Reportedly, some versions of Fake Identd fail to properly handle long
client requests. A specially formatted request split across multiple TCP
packets may cause an internal buffer to overflow. Reportedly, execution of
arbitrary code as the Fake Identd server process is possible.Fake Identd is designed to drop privileges. However, it has also been
reported that this behavior is flawed in some versions. As a result,
exploitation may result in the execution of code with root privileges.

Rizzo, who's one of the FreeBSD whizzes.  All three of the BSD's
packaged IPFilter, which has been around for donkeys years and which has
a slightly different feature set to ipfw.However, last year the author of IPFilter (Darren Reed) changed the
license on development branches of ipfilter to prohibit redistribution,
although official releases would still be kept under the old license. 
This policy got up the nose of Theo de Raadt (lots of things do, which
is why OpenBSD exists in the first place), so OpenBSD re-invented the
wheel and called their firewall ""pf"", under a full-time BSD license.   The standard release versions of ipfilter are unencumbered, as always.> Nope, indeed IPFW2 has just been rolled out into -STABLE. (-STABLE

has some nice features like the ability to save and restore state so

which appeals to the rather conservative tastes of my old age.Nick--

"query : chomsky 's "" single mutation "" on page 43 of his 1977 paper ` language origin theories ' , in duane rumbaugh 's book _ language learning by a chimpanzee _ , gordon hewes asserts that chomsky has explicitly attributed the human language faculty to a single genetic mutation in our ancestors . he gives as his source "" chomsky ( 1967 ) "" , but , exasperatingly , neither this work nor any other work by chomsky is listed in his bibliography , nor is it obvious what work he might have been citing . can anyone point me to any places in chomsky 's writings ( or , indeed , in anyone else 's writings ) in which such a suggestion is explicitly made ? all i ' ve been able to find is chomsky 's repeated suggestions that our language faculty might have arisen as a by-product of other developments and hence as something not subject to natural selection , but that 's not quite the same thing . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk",Safe Email

Â  07.11.2002 GnomeREPORT 
CHRIS TEACHES THE BASICS: If you've got friends or family who want to learn more about their PC, from a guy who makes things nice and easy, check out the VHS release of Computer Basics in the GnomeStore. Chris teams with TechTV cohort, Kate Botello, to lead novices on a journey through their computer. From basic interactions, to installing apps, to using the Internet and e-mail, Chris and Kate have all the basics covered. Help out a friend and  get them a copy today.    Wednesday's trip went fairly smooth overall, and I actually 
enjoyed helping out my friend Larry with some server 
software installation and network configuration tasks. His 
kids seemed impressed with the new ability to copy files 
between the five different computers and have Internet 
access at any of them. Ahh, yes... geeks in the making.After that project was finished, I met up with Jake at a 
nearby Starbucks to shoot the breeze and catch up on all 
things Lockergnome. We email all the time, but it's nice to 
have a face-to-face conversation for a change. He had just 
finished establishing new phone service with Verizon, so he 
has a fun new PalmOS-based phone to play with.After the dose of caffeine, I headed up to Boone, Iowa to 
hook up with my cousin Casey and his wife of two months, 
Stephanie. Their new house is awesome, but disappointing, as 
there was no high-speed Internet connection or wireless 
networking. We'll have to fix that. For now, I'll remain 
impressed with the geothermal heating/cooling system and the 
vast potential of the unfinished basement that will someday 
make an incredible rec room [insert suitable Tim Allen grunt 
here]. Casey is ticked about all of the rain recently because it 
keeps eroding his dirt front yard into the drainage ditch. 
The back yard is in great shape, as there was sod laid after 
construction finished up, but he decided to save a few bucks 
and seed the front himself next spring. This now assumes 
that he'll have a front yard left by then.The rain turned out to be the last event of the evening. 
I drove through the beginning of the storms on the way from 
Ankeny to Boone, and I just knew it was going to be a rough 
drive home later since they were only getting started at 
that time. I was correct. What would normally be an hour and 
45 minute drive turned into nearly two and a half hours and 
many, many animal sightings. As the night wore on, I was 
half expecting to see someone building an ark in a 
cornfield. Must have been where the animals were headed.The rain guage at home showed 3.25"" this morning, adding 
to the 1.25"" and 2.5"" amounts dumped out of it within the 
last week. I considered setting the sprinkler up in the 
front yard today as an attempt at neighborly humor, but 
figured I'd just be labeled as a complete moron instead. So, what did I forget to take with me, you ask? 
Directions to Larry's house. DOH! I had to dig out the 
notebook at a close rest area in a vain attempt to quickly 
memorize the route. Instead, I decided to transcribe the 
list on my Jornada, which would be far easier (and safer) to 
read as I navigated through the streets. There's still a use 
for printers in this world, without question. Reading text 
from the tiny screen bites. Larger print and bold text on a 
sheet of paper is the way to go. At least I didn't leave my 
PDA at home as well, which I actually considered doing.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeNETWORK
Satellite Internet Delays Add Up
http://www.skycasters.com/supervpnwhitepaper.htm
Have you considered moving to a satellite Internet 
provider at some point? While all of the marketing hype 
paints a rosy picture, there are a couple of things that you 
really must consider before writing the check. The birds are 
some 23,000 miles above the surface of the planet, so there 
is a significant delay while the bits float up and back 
down. The absolute minimum time for a packet to get from one 
place to another is nearly a quarter of a second. Add in 
hops across the Internet and other hardware latency and it's 
common to see ping times of between 500 and 1000 
milliseconds - an eternity when you're talking about TCP/IP 
connections. Now consider how VPN connections are affected, 
being that they are generally significantly slower on the 
ground without the extra 46,000 miles. Ouch! This white 
paper is a tad marketing driven, but I think their 
explanation of technology and how they are addressing VPN-
over-satellite connections is quite informative.

PGP Outlook Plug-in Vulnerability
http://www.nai.com/naicommon/download/upgrade/patches/patch-pgphotfix.asp
Even encryption software is potentially exposed to 
security problems. Network Associates' PGP software, which 
interfaces directly with Microsoft Outlook, has been found 
to be vulnerable to malicious code within an email. Exposed 
systems can be made to execute code of the attacker's 
choice, and because email can be sent from anywhere and to 
anywhere. Tracking down the source could be rather 
difficult. Hotfixes for each of NAI's products are available 
on their website.

Intro to Relational Databases
http://www.15seconds.com/issue/020522.htm
You know what a database is, right? Sure you do. Can you 
explain what a relational database is all about? Correctly? 
There's a lot more to database management and development 
than dumping a bunch of records into tables and generating 
reports. Proper design is crucial. Trust me. I've been on 
the receiving end of some lazy programming efforts that 
ignore the foundation of relational databases, and it 
usually results in additional work later.

Smile While You Surf
I like creative use of 404 pages, so sue me. Some of you have complained about the one Chris created for display when you come across a bogus link on the Lockergnome web site, which I don't understand. Would you rather stare at that stupid-looking, uninformative and generally useless one that your browser provides by default? Cramsession.com posted some unique ""excuses"" for their site being down for maintenance, and I thought I'd share a few:Roses are red
Our web site is resting
We're fixing the server
While EverquestingIn the interest of research, we're testing to see how long it takes a Network Administrator to get through a people-size maze to the web servers. As soon as he finds them, we'll be back online... Unless the Marketing Minotaur gets him first.Suicide note found on the web server: ""I've had it. I can't take the heat anymore. You ran me ragged, and what thanks did I get? None. Null. Nothing. I gave and I gave, and you still wanted more I spent every second of my day trying to make you happy, but it was never enough. Always work faster, do more, stay late, work overtime, be more efficient. I was never good enough for you anyway. You deserve better. Signed CPU."" You have reached the Cramsession Maintenance Page.
While you are staring at this page, waiting for the website to come back up, (should take about an hour or two) We'd like to offer the following fun activities:Hold your breath until you see black spots dancing in front of your eyes.
Spin around in your chair until you get nauseous. Wheee!
Pretend your mouse is a microphone. Dictate a memo into it where you outline your plans for global domination.
Connect the dots!

We apologise for the inconvenience of our missing web site. We're doing something really ""high tech"" and ""important"" behind this ""maintenance"" curtain. We'll be back just as soon as we catch all the gophers.....Again.HELP! I'm locked in the Server Room. Please send Help!

"workshop announcement call for papers distributing and accessing linguistic resources workshop immediately before the first international conference on language resources and evaluation ( lrec ) , may 27 1998 granada , spain http : / / www . icp . grenet . fr / elra / conflre . html short description : this workshop will discuss ways to increase the efficacy of linguistic resource distribution and programmatic access , and work towards the definition of a new method for these tasks based on distributed processing and object-oriented modelling with deployment on the www . organizers : yorick wilks , hamish cunningham , wim peters , remi zajac workshop scope and aims - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - in general the reuse of of nlp data resources ( such as lexicons or corpora ) has exceeded that of algorithmic resources ( such as lemmatisers or parsers ) . however , there are still two barriers to data resource reuse : 1 ) each resource has its own representation syntax and corresponding programmatic access mode ( e . g . sql for celex , c or prolog for wordnet , sgml for the bnc ) ; 2 ) resources must generally be installed locally to be usable ( and of course precisely how this happens , what operating systems are supported etc . varies from case to case ) . the consequences of 1 ) are that although resources share some structure in common ( lexicons are organised around words , for example ) this commonality is wasted when it comes to using a new resource ( the developer has to learn everything afresh each time ) and that work which seeks to investigate or exploit commonalities between resources ( e . g . to link several lexicons to an ontology ) has to first build a layer of access routines on top of each resources . so , for example , if we wish to do task-based evaluation of lexicons by measuring the relative performance of an information extraction system with different instantiations of lexical resource , we might end up writing code to translate several different resources into sql or sgml . the consequence of 2 ) is that there is no way to "" try before you buy "" : no way to examine a data resource for its suitability for your needs before licencing it . correspondingly there is no way for a resource provider to expose limitted access to their products for advertising purposes , or gain revenue through piecemeal supply of sections of a resource . this workshop will discuss ways to overcome these barriers . the proposers will discuss a new method for distributing and accessing language resources involving the development of a common programmatic model of the various resources types , implemented in corba idl and / or java , along with a distributed server for non-local access . this model is being designed as part of the gate project ( general architecture for text engineering : http : / / www . dcs . shef . ac . uk / research / groups / nlp / gate / ) and goes under the provisional title of an active creole server . ( creole : collection of reusable objects for language engineering . currently creole supports only algortihmic objects , but will be extended to data objects . ) a common model of language data resources would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs . at the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources ( e . g . lexicons are about words ) ; at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources . programmatic access would be available at all levels , allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an exciting element of the work could be to provide algorithms to dynamically merge common resources ( e . g . connect wordnet to celex ) , what we ' re suggesting initially is not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to existing resources . this is not a new standards initiative , but a way to build on previous initiatives . of course , the production of a common model that fully expressed all the subtleties of all resources would be a large undertaking , but we believe that it can be done incrementally , with useful results at each stage . early versions will stop decomposing the object structure of resources at a fairly high level , leaving the developer to handle the data structures native to the resources at the leaves of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucures . draft program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilks hamish cunningham wim peters remi zajac roberta catizone paola velardi maria teresa pazienza louise guthrie roberto basili bran boguraev sergei nirenburg james pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum paper submission - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - formatting guidelines : papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . hard copies : three hard copies should be sent to : gill callaghan , fao yorick wilks dept . computer science university of sheffield regent court 211 portobello st . , sheffield s1 4dp uk electronic submission : electronic submission will be allowed in poscript or html . an ftp site will be available on demand . authors should send an info email to ( yorick wilks ) even if they submit in paper form . an electronic submission should be accompanied by a plain ascii text . # name : name of first author # title : title of the paper # pages : number of pages # files : name of file ( if also submitted electronically ) # note : anything you 'd like to add # keys : keywords # email : email of the first author # abstr : abstract of the paper # . . . . . . important dates paper submission deadline ( hard copy / electronic ) february 15th 1998 paper notification april 1st camera - ready papers due may 1st dalr workshop may 27st",Safe Email

"re : 5 . 1344 native speaker intuitions the discussion on native speaker intuitions has been extremely interesting , but i worry that my brief intervention may have muddied the waters . i take it that there are a number of separable issues . the first is the extent to which a native speaker is likely to judge a lexical string as grammatical or ungrammatical per se . the second is concerned with the relationships between syntax and interpretation ( although even here the distinction may not be entirely clear cut ) . most english speakers would probably judge child teacher the the asked leave to room the as both ungrammatical and uninterpretable . however , my couple of sentences ( which were from a source that i no longer recall - apologies ! ) raise slightly different issues . if it is possible to interpret the following : 1 . the child asked the teacher to leave the room 2 . the teacher asked the child to leave the room as having the same consequences ( i . e . that it was the child who left the room ) then it seems to me that the relationship between grammatical representation and interpretation is inherently unstable . just because some native speakers solve the problem in one way should not override the empirical fact that other native speakers solve it in another way . if we take the strings : 3 . i would ' ve done it . and the emphatice assertion : 4 . i really would have / of ( / ov / ) it would seem that , on the evidence of ( some ) british speakers ' phonologies , have = of . i . e . , they treat of as a verb in some circumstances . as prescriptivists , we can tell them that they are wrong , and explain ( by analogy ? ) why they are wrong . as descripivists , though , it seems that we have to take such native-speaker intuitions at their face value . in the latter case , we are left with a conundrum and one that seems to me particularly relevant to the problem of second language teaching : who is a native speaker ? for what it is worth , i have tried to explore these issues more detail in ' language and the linguists ' , _ social semiotics _ ( 1993 ) , 3 , 2 , 161-181 tony bex",Safe Email

Political mail (the snail kind) doesn't bother me.  I like it a lot of the 
time, because as crap as it is at least it's not the kind of info you get 
on TV.  Particularly for small time local politics, it's the best way to 
get information.but what matters is that mail is speech, and political email has to be as
well protected as any other political speech.  Spam is *the* tool for
dissident news, since the face that it's unsolicited means that recipients
can't be blamed for being on a mailing list.

"Date:May 16,2002. 
Email:edum@hkem.com. Dear Sir, I am Mr.Eduado de Mello, one of the Principal 
Commanders of the Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola,UNITA.Well needless telling a very long story 
here for our story is indeed interwoven with the 
history of the world and the liberation struggle in 
the Southern African region of the African continent. 
The bubble burst just about some weeks ago today when my supreme 
commander, the late Dr.Jonas Savimbi was killed in an 
encounter with the government forces of the MPLA 
government of my country.The rest is now history but 
suffice it to say that I am tired of the unfortunate 
role of waging a war against my fatherland.I have 
therefore decided to pull out my troupes from the bush 
even if the other field commanders decide otherwise am 
therefore poised to effect a new beginning in my life 
and I have decided to make South Africa my new home at 
least for the interim period until I am sufficiently 
sure that I would be welcome home whole heartedly by 
the MPLA government in Luanda the capital of Angola. 
Needles to say I was the single most important 
commander who was very close to the late supreme 
commander; Dr.Jonas Savimbi.Indeed because I am a 
brother to one of his wives,he confided in me a great 
deal.The result of such trust is my reason for 
contacting you I was the commander whom he sent to 
deposit the sum of Thirty two million USD ($32million) 
with a security/finance company in South Africa.This 
was immediately after the events of September 11,2001 
in the United States of America.Indeed it had become 
increasingly difficult to move large volumes of money 
around the world particularly for a liberation 
movement like UNITA hence the recourse to keeping the 
money with the security company in South Africa. I 
have decided to inherit this money which was taken out 
and deposited with the said security/finance company 
as cash in Hundred dollar denominations.The money is 
kept in my signature and would have been used in the 
purchase of arms and ammunition for the purposes of 
continuing the civil war in Angola.The supreme 
commander is dead and as already stated I have decided 
to quite the whole thing and this is without regard to 
the fact that other commanders may wish to continue ! 
I want to cooperate with you in my decision to inherit 
the $32million.I am still in the bush here but I have 
been able to establish contact with the company in 
South Africa to the effect that I would soon come to 
take possession of the money that I kept with them. 
Note also that I deposited the money as a foreign 
national who is the head of a Mining company in Angola 
(Never as a commander of UNITA). If you are able to 
cooperate with me over this am willing to give you 20% 
of the $32million.Please come back to me through 
email: edum@hkem.com.The security/finance 
company is standing by to receive my instructions on 
this and I will link you up with them as soon as you 
are ready to take possession of the $32million. 
Finally you are to note that in you reply, you are to 
state your residential or company address and if 
possible send a copy of your international passport so 
as to assure me that my money is safe in your hands. 
Yours truly, 
Eduado de Mello _______________________________________________

"wall street ' s dirty little secret . . . it was the spring of 1979 . i was just a tall , goofy looking kid in middle school with buck - teeth and freckles . each day in the cafeteria , i walked from table to table . . . stealing other kids ' lunch money . no , i didn ' t rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made them a little deal . "" let me borrow two dollars today , "" i said , "" and i ' ll bring you five dollars next week . "" the investment was too good to pass up , and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes . of course when "" next week "" rolled around and i couldn ' t pony up the cash , i promised to pay them even more the week after that , if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer . eventually the end of the year came and went , high school started and with it came girls , and homework , and parties , and sports , and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year ' s lunch money . i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid , and i didn ' t even get beat up . hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn . first of all , greed is your number one enemy . you ' re not going to turn $ 2 into $ 5 in a week , so cash out when you ' re ahead . don ' t wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket . second , never trust an investment adviser of any kind . they are looking out for their own money , not yours . the "" professionals "" , those stuffy investment counselors and money managers , will always tell you that the best time to buy is now . according to those guys , the longer you keep your money in the market , the more money you ' re going to make . ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is "" never "" . in a sense , they are right . if you put $ 250 , 000 in an index fund right now , you ' ll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years . but here ' s the problem : do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich ? hell no ! you want the money now - so you can enjoy it . it ' s hard to make use of your fortune when you ' re seventy years old in a wheelchair . if you could make a million dollars in the next few years , what would you do with it ? where would you travel ? what kind of car would you buy ? the fact is . . . youth is the best time to be rich . if your goal is to make quick profits in the market , volatility is your ally , and stability your enemy . you want to see those large upswings , two hundred points in a day , followed by the four hundred point crash a week later . you don ' t care if the market went up or down 20 % this year as long it was unstable . that ' s how you ' re going to make the money . what i ' m talking about here is day trading . my father invests the traditional way ; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k . in the long term of 5 - 10 years he makes money . the day trader buys or sells 5 , 000 shares of xyz for a $ 25 , 000 profit in a 5 - 10 minute trade . he acts quickly , taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock , and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours , sometimes within minutes . i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it . it ' s not rocket science , and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started . society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training . the truth is , wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money . popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring . they don ' t want the competetion - and they sure as hell don ' t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they ' d charge you forty or fifty dollars . they make their money only if you believe two lies : 1 ) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average person . 2 ) that using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade . here is what the financial gurus in today ' s society absolutely , positively do not want you to know . . . the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying . after reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade , and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market , i ' ve learned the following lessons : * * achieving financial success is incredibly simple . * * anyone can do it . * * it only takes a few hours to learn . when i discovered the secret to day trading , i didn ' t become wealthy overnight . if you want instant cash , drive to wal - mart . buy a ski mask and a shotgun , and rob your local bank . the only way to get rich , quick or otherwise , is through hard work , knowledge , and determination . after learning the fundamentals of day trading , i started practicing the trading art itself , and the first few weeks brought modest gains . the next few months gave me the practical experience i needed to really earn a living , and i was pulling close to a six figure income . in less than three years with no formal financial training , minimal effort and only moderate risk , i had made my first million . the knowledge that i gained during those formative trading years i am willing to share with you in my new book , the master trader . you will learn from my mistakes , and from my successes , as i teach you the simple , secret formula for day trading that i ' ve used profitably year after year . the income of the day trader can be staggering . thousands , even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes . the difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this : knowledge . i will provide that knowledge , and i will give you a winning edge at this high - stakes game . average income of a day trader : 5 % average an income in excess of $ 500 , 000 per year 22 % average an income in excess of $ 250 , 000 per year 35 % average an income in excess of $ 100 , 000 per year . 27 % average an income between $ 50 , 000 and $ 99 , 999 per year 11 % average an income between $ 20 , 000 and $ 49 , 999 per year after reading the master trader , you will discover extremely profitable , simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win despite the current market weakness . here is just a snippet of what i will teach you : * * * make money whether a stock goes up or down . * * * learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds . * * * learn exactly what stocks to trade , the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them . * * * save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the mistakes beginners make . * * * learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money consistently in every market ! * * * learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance for great success . * * * profit on huge intraday price swings . * * * make money on the biggest news stories . * * * actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum returns . * * * learn how to use the tools and information wall street professionals use . * * * learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind . it ' s time to ask yourself : "" am i going to listen to the professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell ? or am i going to take control of my own financial future , and start making money right now in the stock market ? "" who is looking out for your best economic interests - some wealthy wall street stockbroker , or yourself ? with the master trader e - book , you will learn everything you need to know in order to get started with day trading . . . from choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional trading strategies that make professional traders millions of dollars . the master trader e - book is the most comprehensive yet easy to understand and straight - forward book ever written about active trading . if you are serious about success in short term stock trading - order today and start paving the road to your own financial future . oh , and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade ? his high school friends laughed when he said he was going to make money in the stock market . six years later , he bought a beach - front home on the california coast - with cash . oops , they weren ' t laughing anymore . in a rollercoaster market like we have today , day trading is the fastest track to wealth . if you ' re looking for a long - term retirement investment with no risk that goes up 5 % a year , then by all means , this ain ' t your kind of game . but if you want the quickest possible way to make a fortune in the market , with the lowest element of risk , then order the master trader e - book right now . i promise to teach you all of the secrets that helped me become a millionaire through successful day trading . you don ' t need to know anything about the market , and anyone can do it , with minimum effort . it ' s an easy game to win if you know how the pieces move . order the master trader e - book right now for only $ 49 . 97 by clicking on the link below : http : / / 4 tools 4 life . com / qs our company is strictly opposed to unsolicited emails . to be removed from this list , please send an email to "" bulkexpert @ yahoo . com """,Phishing Email

Since the pick command works, the sequence (actually, both of them, the

"power trading hi folks : very glad to hear about the new developments . just to recap what we discussed this morning about different things you need to look into to set up trading operations and the contacts : 1 . licence to trade : regulatory people : i guess you know about this part better than me . 2 . trading & risk mgmt : global risk mgmt oversight : john sherrif in london has the overall responsibility outside western hemisphere . research group can help with the structuring models used for trading . 3 . risk conrols : before trading group is operational , it needs to get the authorization from the board of directors of enron along with total position limits and possibly value @ risk limits . these limits are typically by commodity type and by region . risk assessment & control ( rac ) under rick buy performs the internal control function ensuring that the businesses adhere to these trading limits . ted murphy is the vp in rac overseeing the trading operations . the value @ risk models come from the research group , but day - to - day monitoring of the numbers is done by ted ' s group . 4 . credit risk : a credit reserve number is computed for each deal ( again , the models are created by research ) and is transferred to the credit group under bill bradford ( also in rac ) . this is basically like buying insurance from the corp . , so that if there is a couterparty default , the loss is covered by the reserve pool of the credit dept . 5 . legal : the name i was given is alan aronowitz for legal help . 6 . back office : initially can survive with excel spreadsheets . you should contact the it though when the plans finalize to talk about systems . australia is the most recent place where we set up the trading operations . you can talk to paul quilky , the trader there to talk about these issues ( mention to him that grant masson in research gave his name ) . barry pierce in london was incharge of back office at the begin there . i can coordinate for talking with people next week . give me a call monday if possible . i hadn ' t the time to search for the presentation stuff today . will do it next week . krishna .",Safe Email

It did not.Pg 92: The value of land in the formal sector of Lima averages US$50 per square meter, whereas in the area of Gamarra, where a great deal of Peru's informal manufacturing sector resides, the value per square meter can go as high as US$3,000.==========I'd have made the same assumption you did. De Soto says that isn't correct. You can find mansions that don't have title. A lot of them, in fact. But they can't be used for collateral for a loan, or otherwise participate as 'capital' because of their extra-legal status. > > Mr. Long, I think you'd particularly enjoy the De Soto work. > > On the ""to find"" list. Any chance of > an explanation of that ""Bell Jar"" in > the meantime?French historian Fernand Braudel (so Braudel's Bell Jar, not De Soto's)==>The key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past, which I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if in a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and conquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the whole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent country residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ... between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence under Lorenzo the Magnificent? --------------De Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do not. The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property. What they don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital and allow it to start growing. Their property can only be exchanged with a small section of people who know them personally.[1] Actual poor people, not 'poor' Americans with a living standard that is the envy of most of the world. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",Safe Email

"Dear Sir/Madam,I am well confident of your capability to assist me in
a transaction for mutual benefit of both parties, ie
(me and you) I am also believing that you will not

to establish with you. I have decided to contact you
with greatest delight and personal respect.Well, I am  VICTOR SANKOH, Son to Mr.FODAY

who was arrested by the ECOMOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE
months ago in my country Sierra Leone.
Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided
in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and
Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in
Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box
containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two
Million dollars).This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond
by my FATHER and he have already
decided to use this money for future investment of
the family before his arrest.Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these
documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my
father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a
Refugee by the Government of Cï¿½te d'Ivoire.Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a
trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this
money from Cï¿½te d'Ivoire immediately for investment .
Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to
transfer this fund into your Account, but I will
demand for the following requirement:(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country or
another neaarby country where taxation will not
takegreat toll on the money?(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my
travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for
theinvestment of this money?(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable
business venture that would not require much technical
expertise in your country where part of this fund
willbe invested?Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as

general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a
Christian and I will please, want you to handle this

"Congratulations!!A few observations:All children are different and will generally route around whatever 
technique you learned from relatives, books, talk shows, or the last child.Just when you get good at being a parent, you're done.Don't overprotect. I always called this ""First Baby Syndrome"". A 
neighbor at one point had a 4 or 5 year old that would choke on jello, 
probably because she never allowed him to have solid food until he was 
far too old, IMHO. I fed mine cereal, etc., early and let them get the 
hang of it. I always want my kids to be able to handle anything if I'm 
not there so I have them try it out when I am. (Within limits of 
course.) Of course, I'm now beating up my body at Vans Skate Park trying 
to do 5ft. half pipes on speed skates with my 10 year old daughter.sdwGary Lawrence Murphy wrote:>>>>>>""t"" == tomwhore   writes:

Sure if you're willing to risk firing, lawsuits, etc. The last full time

"Ananova:Â  
Dracula theme park could be switched to BucharestA controversial scheme to build a Dracula theme park in Romania could be
switched away from Transylvania.
Consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers is now recommending that it be built in
Bucharest instead.
It comes after Prince Charles led international protests against the
original proposals to build it in the medieval town of Sigishoara.
PricewaterhouseCoopers name Bucharest, originally believed to be an outsider
in the race to host the park, as the most profitable location for the
project.
But that has angered residents in Sigishoara, where Vlad the Impaler, the
inspiration for Dracula, was born. They are counting on the park to boost
the local economy.
Evenimentul Zilei reports that Sigishoara was placed behind the capital with
the Black Sea port of Constanta third choice.
Dorin Danesan, mayor of Sigishoara, said: ""The pre-feasibility report from
PWC shows that the park would attract more tourists if it was located in
Bucharest. But I still think that Sigishoara is the best location for it.""
The park would include hotels, a Dracula roller coaster, catacombs, a ghost
train and a house of horrors, as well as vampire dungeons located around a
reconstruction of Dracula's castle and an artificial lake.
The project has also been objected to by the world heritage organisation
Unesco fearing Sigishoara might be spoilt.
PricewaterhouseCoopers is to present its final report on the project on
October 15.

Software already recognize it. Courier eg. doesn't send auto-replies to 
mails with the Precedence bulk or junk. I think Outlook does handle these 
special, too. [1] says:
| Autoresponses should always contain the header
|          Precedence: junk
| Notice the spelling of ""prec-e-dence"". In particular, count the number of
| n:s (and a:s and s:es, if you're totally agraphic and/or from the United
| States). This will prevent well-tempered mail programs from generating
| bounce messages for these. If the recipient can't be reached, the
| autoresponder message is simply discarded. 
| [...]
| (For what it's worth, the meaning of the Precedence header in practice is
| that it affects Sendmail so that messages identified as less important get
| moved back in the queue under high load. [...])>[...]Malte[1] Moronic Mail Autoresponders (A FAQ From Hell):

http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/07/23/binladen.internet/index.html    ... CNN reported earlier this year that al Qaeda has used at least one
    Web site to post information and keeps changing the site's address to
    stay ahead of investigators.    Authorities also are investigating information from detainees that
    suggests al Qaeda members -- and possibly even bin Laden -- are hiding
    messages inside photographic files on pornographic Web sites.Any wagers that this heralds the appearance of a bill to ban and/or
harrass any sites which may be host to suspected-AlQaeda messages?And what about Emenem records played backwards?--

"I got to see Powell talk in March 2001 at the beginning of his
reign at the FCC.  He said they were going to take a real
hands off approach, so it's funny that they would blame
the regulators for causing the collapse.  One thing he did
get right, is that he wasn't worried that the US was behind
Europe in the wireless licensing spectrum.  This is something
very prescient in that most of those licensors have had to
eat their lunch over the huge licensing costs they paid for
very little benefit.  His legacy was/is supposed to be
rethinking the FCC's role to stay out of the way in this
period of business innovation in the wireless space as he
didn't want the government forcing business models onto
the private sector.His full transcript is here [1].  Interestingly enough I
got to see his speech in person as he was part of the whole
CTIA'2001 Las Vegas keynote series of speakers.  Clay and
I hoped a flight out of Ontario to Las Vegas to do demo support
for Craig Barrett [2].  His message was that there's no difference
between wired and wireless Internet--it's all the same thing.
Instead of scalable networks, we should be thinking about scalable
content (& using Magi he showed sending a blue man tv commercial
from a desktop to a laptop to an ipaq to a color smartphone with
the content scaling back for each target platform).The best part of the whole trip wasn't hobnobbing at all,
but really the fact that the Venetian had ran out of rooms.
They decided to put us up in one of their $10,000/night high
roller rooms.  They put Clay in one and me in another.
The Venetian is known for having the largest hotel rooms
anywhere, but these ones were bigger than my whole house. 8-)Greg

> 
> ""I think we'll never know,"" Powell said. ""I don't think it's an

>

>

"k . polgardi , vowel harmony vowel harmony . an account in terms of governement and optimality by krisztina polgardi vowel harmony deals with some theoretical problems concerning the phenomenon of vowel harmony , in a framework combining insights from government phonology , optimality theory and lexical phonology . the study introduces and motivates the general framework and examines three issues . the first concerns the typology of vowel harmony systems and how an element-based feature theory , comprised of the three elements i , a and u and supplemented by the property of headedness , can account for all the different types of harmony . the second concerns the domain of harmony and the question of how to handle disharmonicity in the proposed model . the third involves the so-called neutral vowels , i . e . those vowels in a system that do not have a harmonic counterpart . it is claimed that the behaviour of neutral vowels can be predicted from their segmental make-up and from particular properties of the vowel systems involved . polgrdi argues that the theory of government phonology ( a principles-and - parameters approach ) needs to be supplemented by constraint ranking , because certain types of phenomena cannot be accounted for otherwise . since ranking is shown to be necessary , language variation can now be exclusively expressed by this device , and the notion of param - eters can be abandoned . polgrdi also argues that a non-derivational version of the strict cycle condition also needs to be incorporated into the theory to account for so-called derived environment effects ( of which disharmonicity is shown to be an example ) . 1998 . xii + 200 pp . isbn 90-5569 - 046 - 5 . paperback . lot interna - tional series 3 . hil / leiden university dissertation . price for individuals ordering directly from the publisher : nlg 36 , 90 , excl . vat and p&p . holland academic graphics , the hague < http : / / www . hag . nl > rint sybesma holland academic graphics po box 53292 2505 ag the hague the netherlands fax : + 31 70 448 0177",Safe Email

"the negotiation skills company , inc . newsletter aug 2001 fighting fires without burning bridges ( sm ) the occasional newsletter of the negotiation skills company , inc . ( tnsc ) now our website is even more accessible . if you have a question about issues you can search the advice section to find relevant answers . follow the link below to our q the reverse is equally true . in negotiation , this technique is called active listening . the crucial element is listening closely to all the elements of the responses to those questions , both the questions one asks oneself and the questions asked of other people . it is no less important to respond to what people say by checking to make sure you ' ve understood their points ; you may want to say , "" this is what i understood you to have said ; is my understanding correct ? "" you also want to indicate , "" the fact that i understand what you have said does not necessarily mean i agree with you . "" clinging on to the visual indicators of independence is a critical vital sign . the fear of loving relatives that something bad can happen has to be balanced against the knowledge that if you kick someone in their self - esteem , you are attacking a most vulnerable part of their anatomy . you cannot negotiate away a person ' s self - esteem , but you can destroy it through frontal and flanking attacks . the frustration faced by folks who see loved ones failing to take proper care of themselves is phenomenal . very often the people who have advocated professional care ultimately must mutter ( hopefully to themselves ) the unsatisfying statement , "" i told you so . "" in your question you indicate that crisis forces choice . perhaps the best approach is to prepare a safety net that is ready when the crisis occurs . it cannot prevent a crisis from happening ; and it is crucial to make sure that a crisis is not worsened by forcing the ' victim ' of it to lose face . but having that safety net ready can at least reduce the force of the fall . relationship is one of the seven most significant issues to consider in negotiation . focusing on the relationship with an elderly parent or friend , not letting decrepitude get in the way of love and caring can make it much easier when someone ' s self - esteem is attacked by a crisis . looking at oneself and saying , "" it ' s not my fault , "" is not a way of avoiding blame , but rather giving a loved one the freedom to make their own mistakes - - just as they did the first time they gave us the keys to the car . tnsc news the negotiation skills company ' s website , www . negotiationskills . com , is now getting more than 1 . 5 million ' hits ' a year - that means an average of more than 5000 visits every day . there have been newspaper and magazine articles about us across north america - and we ' re now featured in translation in a web magazine in poland . last word "" don ' t look back . somebody may be gaining on you .

"I am trying to secure three of four virtual hostnames on our Apache server.
We are not taking credit card orders or user's personal information, but are
merely hoping to secure email and calendar web transactions for our users.
We are not running any secure applications on the root host.I have been testing this week with CA, client, and host certificate
requests, certificates, and keys, and think I have a fairly good beginner's
grasp of the commands and command line options.
My questions are:1.  Is it necessary to create a CA certificate for each of the secure
virtual hosts, or can one CA certificate for the root be used to sign each
of the keys for all three common names we are trying to secure?2.  Even though the root host is not conducting secure transactions, am I
correct in configuring the server with a CACertificateFile in the main body
of httpsd.conf and then setting the CACertificateFile for each virtual host
in the  section of httpsd.conf?  This sort of assumes the
answer to 1. is  - you need a CA for each virtual host.3.  Is it necessary to create a client certificate to distribute to our
users, or is it sufficient to have the CA certificate and a server
certificate for the virtual hosts?  Wouldn't a client certificate only be
necessary if we were trying to verify the client's identity?  Would that be
a good idea given our scenario?Thanks in advance for your help.

the energy density, and you can get the energy out fast enough. Note that
the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run

"SUBJECT: 
                   Urgent Concern Pls.I am a serious officer with one of our main branches of CITI BANK,
consumer Banking Department. Although we didn't have previous correspondence till date.
However, based on the standard value place on everything about you,  I believed we could discuss, analyze and execute this transaction.The transaction is thus:
I've a wealthy client, an American Citizen who had been residing in West Africa for decades now, he operates a fix deposit account with us which I am his account officer, and also 
receives standing orders  for his chains of dividends share.
However, this client Mr. David Brown died as an  out come of Heart attack,and the funds in his current account has  been claimed by his family, who had gone back finally to USA.
At the end of Fiscal year, March 2001, an  accumulated share of US$12.360M was transferred into his account from the Stock Exchange.
This was alone the instructions we issued to the Stock House to dispose all his stocks.Now the funds has arrived, I needed an associate whom I would present as the inheritor of this fund i.e. Associate partner of Mr. David Brown so as to receive this fund.
Please note, his family has left since,and never  know about this stocks in the exchange and the funds has subsequently matured in his Fix Deposit Account, so I as the account officer 
has prepared all documents for easy claims of this fund.
Immediately, you reach me, I will furnish you  with further details and then negotiate on the sharing ratio once you show your sincere involvement to go along with me. It will be of 
need for you to furnish me also your personal phone and fax  numbers for urgent
messages. 
I am anxiously waiting to hear your consent. Be guided.Thanking you .Yours sincerely,Dave Framo.

"Hiya folks,I'm currently running RawHide, since I had the brilliant idea that, by
using APT, it might actually be practical to keep up with the
developments.However, APT seems to want a recompile - its sometimes leaving the RPM
database in need of a db_recover - and gcc 3.2 seems to require a closer
adherence to the standard than the C++ in APT was written for.This is a bit of a bummer.Does anyone know if there's a latest version I could try which might
work, or whether I should simply do the porting myself? (I've made a
start, but there's a fair amount of work to do.)If this works out, I might start a repository for the freshrpms compiled
on vLatest RawHide, for my own purposes and anyone else who's
interested.Dave._______________________________________________

"eol data mining vince , here are four graphs i came up with yesterday afternoon that may be of interest : the first one shows what percentage of our trades are done with different counterparties - ( note the large part that aquila plays ! ) the other three graphs look at how trading volume varies during the week between the hours of 8 : 00 am and 4 : 00 pm for different categories of product . natural gas and power have their own graphs , as they have the largest traded volumes .

"" fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , "" people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , "" she says . as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah "" hurricane debby "" hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at the startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter . fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; janet davidson , group president , integrated network solutions , lucent ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon . while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : "" we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . "" the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first . in a related story , "" it took a lady to save avon , "" katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , "" jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . "" over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins . in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou -

"" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20 to = 90 days was done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report = # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , "" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more = programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , = relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . "" well , i had 196 orders for = report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march = 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in = every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . = 20 always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i ' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! "" threw it away "" "" i had received this program before . i threw it away , but later wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get a copy , so i had to wait until i was emailed another copy of the program . eleven months passed , then it came . i didn ' t throw this one away . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try . "" dawn w . , evansville , in "" no free lunch "" "" my late father always told me , ' remember , alan , there is no free lunch in life . you get out of life what you put into it . ' through trial and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start , i finally figured it out . the program works very well , i just had to find the right target group of people to email it to . so far this year , i have made over $ 63 , 000 using this program . i know my dad would have been very proud of me . "" alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . = 20 any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to = will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for = a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do = that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is = practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is = being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and = 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at erris mail order marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use = $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20 to 90 days . before you say "" bull "" , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not = involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , = store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) = to the person listed for the specific report . international = = 20 orders should also include $ 2 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the required changes in the name list , save it as a text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever email program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email lists . step ( 4 ) email a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous = 20 money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , email to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . 00 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four 4 reports . always provide same-day service on all orders !

Dear Friend
 
 I am the first son of the late Mobutu Sese Seko, the
former
 President 
 of the Congo Republic. I am presently under
protective custody
 in Nigeria
 as
a political refugee. I got your contact over the internet during my
search for a
 stranger
 that
can cooperate with me in this mutual transaction.i took this option because my family friends and associates cpuld not be trusted any more since they contributed to my present predicament.
 
I want you to note that this business will benefit
both of us.
 However, 
you must confirm your ability to handle this because
it involves
 a large
amount of money. The money (50 million US DOLLARS is
my share of
 my
 father's
estate. I boxed and shipped the money to a security
company
 abroad at the
peak of the war/political crisis that rocked my
country few
 years ago. Now
the crisis has ended and I need a trustworthy person
like you to
 proceed to
the place of the security company in order to clear
the fund and
 invest on
my behalf as I dont want my name to be used for now.
 
Note that I will send to you the relevant documents
that will
 enable 
you take possesion of the the fund for onward
investment for our
 mutual 
benefit. All I need from you is as follows:1. A letter of committment (duely signed) that you
will keep the
transaction strictly confidential.
2. Your confirmation of your ability to handle this.
3. Your international identity or driving licence
number for
 identification
to the security company.
4. Your telephone and fax numbers for communication.
5. Your full permanent address.
 
As soon as I get the above information from you, I
will disclose
 to 
you the name and the country of the security company.
I will
 forward your
name and particulars to the security company to enable
 them contact you
accordingly. I will also send to you a LETTER OF
AUTHORITY to
 enable you
clear the fund on my behalf. Note that this is a very
safe
 transaction as
this money is my share of my father'sestate.

entre adn et organisation cellulaire , qu ' en est-il de l ' embryogenese comme hermeneutique du vivant ? * quelle diffrence y a-t - il entre l ' interpretation par le vivant , l ' homme et la machine ? quels modeles en avons-nous et sont-ils conflictuels ? que nous apprend l ' ordinateur comme machine universelle a traiter le signe ? * quel est le role des conflits et antagonismes dans la construction d ' interpretation ? pourquoi les eviter et comment les utiliser ? * comment une interpretation individuelle est-elle possible ou qu ' en est-il de l ' interpretation collective et du role de la multiplicite des points de vue , qu ' ils soient methodologiques , contextuels ou de niveaux , et donc des conflits qui peuvent en resulter ? qu ' en est-il de l ' interpretation comme resolution des conflits et donc moteur d ' evolution ? * si , comme dans la deuxieme definition du greimas ( voir notes ) , les signes sont toujours deja signifiants , comment peuvent-ils avoir ce statut ? qu ' est-ce qui les rend signifiants ? qu ' en est-il de la pensee symbolique des civilisations anciennes ou orientales et qui a ete cultivee chez nous jusqu ' au moyen - age ( g . durand ) ? comment cette forme d ' interpretation s ' articule-t - elle avec les signes decontextualises , jusqu ' a etre calculables et a la conception de l ' interpretation qui en decoule ? * de quels processus de legitimation des interpretations disposons-nous ? quelles relations l ' interpretation entretient-elle avec l ' action ou l ' argumentation que ce soit avant , par ou apres coup ? comment l ' interpretation s ' articule-t - elle a la controverse , la negociation , l ' ajustement ? * puisque la simulation joue un role de plus en plus grand dans l ' activite du modelisateur : comment s ' articulent la simulation et l ' interpretation ? ces questions sont au coeur de la plupart des sciences et plus particulirement la semiotique , l ' hermeneutique , les sciences cognitives et neurosciences , la philosophie , la psychologie , la linguistique et psycholinguistique , l ' intelligence artificielle , l ' anthropologie et la sociologie . elles sous-tendent galement l ' activit scientifique , tant dans la modelisation que dans l ' exprimentation . elles sont inseparables des activites des concepteurs - ingenieurs , informaticiens , architectes . . . - dont les productions proviennent de la resolution de conflits d ' interpretations du monde , et sont soumises des conflits d ' interpretation . notes : selon "" semiotique - dictionnaire raisonne de la theorie du langage "" de greimas et courts , on distingue au moins deux acceptions de l ' interpretation , l ' interpretation comme attribution de significations des signes qui en sont depourvus et l ' interpretation comme paraphrase ( au sens large ) de signes deja remplis de significations . cette deuxieme acception fait echo au "" dictionnaire de la psychanalyse "" de laplanche et pontalies qui definit l ' interpretation comme degagement , par l ' investigation analytique , de sens latent dans le dire et les conduites d ' un sujet ; faisant donc reference a la fois au sens deja la et , en plus , sa modalite d ' obtention . soumission des contributions les propositions de communication , de 4 12 pages , devront parvenir en trois exemplaires ou sous forme electronique ( word attache vivement souhaite ) a l ' adresse suivante : christophe parisse , inserm , laboratoire de neuropsychologie de l ' enfant , batiment pharmacie 3eme etage , hopital de la salpetriere , 47 bd de l ' hopital , 75651 paris cedex 13 , france e - mail : parisse @ ext . jussieu . fr dates importantes reception des manuscrits : 31 septembre 1998 notification d ' acceptation : 9 novembre 1998 remise des versions finales : 10 decembre 1998",Safe Email
"Hi,Just the kind of announce I make once in a while :
- I've rebuilt a new ""alsaplayer"" package based on Angle's one.
- I've rebuilt a hopefully final version ""-fr8"" of the ""alsa-driver"" and
  ""alsa-kernel"" packages which fix all known SMP build issues.Both can be found here :
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/I've also repackaged gkrellm 2.0.2 with at last a separate package for the
server that can be installed standalone and doesn't even require glib2.
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/gkrellm/Last but not least, my latest proftpd 1.2.6 package incorporates some nifty
new features : You can use any of ""--with ldap"", ""--with mysql"" and ""--with
postgres"" when rebuilding the source rpm with rpmbuild to enable desired
extra authentication methods and all package requirements are set
accordingly, and the release tag is changed too.
http://valhalla.freshrpms.net/ (the usual place ;-))I think I'll use this ""--with "" switch more and more where
possible. Some other of my package already use it like the xmame for its

C++ this is not such a big issue as string.length() can be declared const.
So long as you do not modify the string object, the compiler can do the
caching for you.I do not think this is possible in C, though?You could write the same code fragment as:
============================
for(a=0,l=strlen(somestring);a<l;a++)
{
    some_thing_goes_here();
    if(b==l-4)
        do_something();
}
============================Note my previous point: if some_thing_goes_here() or do_something() are very
long functions, then there is no real need to optimise this code.Also, for string manipulation, a much better approach would be:
============================
char c;
char* p;
for(p=somestring,(c=*p)!=0;p++)
{
    some_thing_goes_here();
    if(*(p+4)==0)
        do_something();
}
============================This works because C used \0 terminated strings. It improves performance
because you always have a pointer to the character instead of having to do
array manipulation. Strictly speaking, the variable c is not required as
most compilers are smart enough to store *p in a register.The problem is that this uses pointer arithmetic, which can make the code
illegable if not managed carefully. Which is one of the reasons I prefer
Java for most programming tasks. :)- Matthew

sequences) and I don't think I've ever seen a ""pseq"" ...I'm guessing that that's the sequence that you have ""pick"" create
As I recall it, it has no default sequence name, so the sequence names
that people use will tend to vary from person to person won't they
(except as MH configurations move around institutions by osmosis).I've always used ""sel"" for that purpose.I kind of doubt that any pre built-in sequence name is going to be
very general.   Even ""unseen"" can be changed (fortunately that one

"rate of loss for "" basic "" vocabulary some months ago there was an extended discussion of the proposal made in the fifties by swadesh that there are certain lists of meanings which have the property that the words expressing them are lost at a fairly constant rate per millennium in all languages , in particular , a certain 100 - meaning list where the rate is around 86 % . while noting that bergsland and vogt have adduced examples where the rate seems to be lower , i pointed out that i had not found any examples where it was clearly higher . jacques guy referred to the eastern greenlandic data discussed by bergsland and vogt in current anthropology in 1962 , but , having just carefully read this paper , i see that they state that , while they surmise that the rate here was higher , they cannot calculate what is was ( presuumably because there are no sources for greenlandic that are old enough ) . moreover , the purely conjectural rate of 72 % which they mention is still low enough for the purposes of the original discussion we were having about this , namely , to assure that in a family with enough ramification there would be a substantial portion of the original vocabulary reflected in at least two descendants after far more than 10 , 000 years ( provided each language was independely losing 28 % of the original vocabulary per millennium ) . i do n't have the numbers handy , but jacques , who is better at this anyway , can probably whip some up . but i should also add that bergsland nd vogt 's data are also consistent with many other assumptions , notably , that the rate of retention in e . greenlandic was 86 % , but that it was substanitally lower in some other eskimo languages ( because all they have is the result that e . greenlandic is as different lexically from w . greenlandic as the two together are from yupik , which makes no sense given the family tree if the rates are the same eveywhere ) . but this could be due to slower vocabulary loss in yupik ( or even in the common ancestror of e . and w . greenlandic , or both ) just as well as to faster loss in e . greenlandic . so there is no justification that i can find for bergsland and vogt 's or guy 's assumption that the "" prolem "" lies in a faster rate of loss in e . greenlandic .",Safe Email

"take: if genetic engineering includes selective breeding, then it also includes human pairs that are not randomly grouped.It doesn't matter if those two intend what they are doing, they are engaged in a 'selected sort'. It has been brought up that a boss no longer marries his secretary. Now the female law partner selects another high earning mate (at least associate law). So instead of two couples making $140K a piece (100K + 40K) you have one pair with $200 and one pair with $80 and this has some interesting social effects. And one of those effects is the difference in their children (on average). > -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Karl > Anderson > Sent: Wednesday, July 24, 2002 1:15 PM > To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org > Subject: Re: [Baseline] Raising chickens the high-tech way > > Elias Sinderson writes: > > > Sorry, Karl, your confusing things. > > No, it's just a silly discussion, but that's what picky semantic > discussions turn into :) > > > Thos is saying that selective > > breeding should be counted as genetic engineering, whereas you are > > extending his definition to include the attration that your parents > felt... > > Yes, I'm saying that if he extends ""genetic engineering"" to include > selecting animals to breed, he must extend it to include selecting > people to breed with. > > > Unless your parents were selectively bred like livestock to produce you, > > I don't think you can make that case... :-) > > I'm saying that my parents selected each other, and that they did so > because (among other reasons) each wanted the other's genes to be > mixed with their own in the offspring that they were planning. > > What does it matter that they were selecting to produce their own > offspring, rather than the offspring of two unrelated animals? > > -- > Karl Anderson kra@monkey.org http://www.monkey.org/~kra/ > http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/forkhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",Safe Email

spec file, which is now done :http://freshrpms.net/builds/gnuboy/gnuboy.specBasically, %doc is used to put files in %docdir (default to
/usr/share/docs/%{name}-%{version}/ and the listed files with relative
paths (i.e. that don't start with a ""/"") are relative to the %{builddir}
(the uncompressed source usually). So either you can choose to have a
""docs"" directory inside %{_docdir} by putting :
%doc docs
(or, totally equivalent, the latter just reminding it's a directory)
%doc docs/
Or you can put all files that are in docs/ directly in %{_docdir} :
%doc docs/*Try both, poke around, and you should catch the difference if it's not
already clear for you.
You can also mark any file from the %{buildroot} as documentation (will be
listed when using ""-qd"" to query the package's docs) by using %doc with
absolute filenames, for example :
%doc %{_datadir}/foo-game/manual
(this is /usr/share/foo-game/manual, an absolute file)
Also, for the packager's convenience, all files in /usr/share/man (aka
%{_mandir}) are automatically tagged as %doc.> Also one more thing, whats the best way to work out the dependencies?

without those fields and see what the configure script is checking for
(basically, the libs and versions you'll need to add to the BuildRequires:)
then once the package is built, query the automatic dependencies that rpm
put into it. You'll see for instance if the binaries/libs from the package
need SDL, gtk+  etc. Then add those ""Requires:"" and rebuild a final version
of the package.
Often you can omit some dependencies, for example if a program is checking
for glib, gtk+, gdk-pixbuf and gnome libraries when being compiled,
BuildRequires: gnome-libs-devel
Requires: gnome-libs
will be enough since they already depend on the ""lower level"" libs that are
glib, gtk+ and gdk-pixbuf.> Once again sorry to bother you with this, but I figured you were the

although there probably is since Red Hat decided to default disabling it a
few releases back :-/
Normally, even if you try to enable DMA and your device doesn't support it,
it simply don't be able to make the change, and that's it. The problem IIRC
is with crappy hardware that is supposed to support DMA but doesn't work as
expected when it's enabled... maybe Chris could confirm this? ;-)I guess I'll settle for the /dev/dvd link change as described and putting
the DMA tip in the %description :-)Matthias--

"I get a box I don't want any of that integrated chipset crap whether its for winblows or linux. Its just like IBM (mwave dsp chip ?) (shared video/main memory ?)in the old days.

Dell makes excellent machines and I would recomend their machines and their aftersales support over any other manufacturer that I can think of. However if you want that box for linux and you have a life and you dont want to spend a week of it fucking arround and googling to get that box working properly be damned sure you do your research before you buy it.

"" the resolution seems to send an additional signal that the senate does not see any great need to bail out edison . the assembly did not pass the resolution , however . given the senate ' s view , and the open hositility between davis and burton , davis ' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the senate with vetoes unless the senate first passes the davis ' edison bill . it is unclear at this time whether davis would play it that tough . with the legislature gone , the action turns to the puc , where a vote on da suspension is scheduled for thursday . we are working with customers and providers to stop da from being suspended , or at a minimum , to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive . finally , burton held a news conference this morning at which he said : burton and senator bowen ( bowen ' s been taking the lead on da in the senate ) will ask the california puc to do a study on how da can be retained without "" adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses .

"the evaluation of parsing systems the evaluation of parsing systems a workshop jointly organised by the cec language engineering 1 projects sparkle and ecran to be held at the first international conference on language resources and evaluation granada , spain , 26 may 1998 this workshop will provide a forum for researchers interested in the development and evaluation of natural language grammars and parsing systems , and in the creation of syntactically annotated reference corpora . organisers : john carroll , roberto basili , nicoletta calzolari , robert gaizauskas , gregory grefenstette workshop scope and aims the aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussion of evaluation methods for parsing systems , and proposals for the development of syntactically annotated language resources . with increased attention to evaluation of component technology in language engineering , evaluation of parsing systems is rapidly becoming a key issue . numerous methods have been proposed and while one , the parseval / penn treebank scheme , has gained wide usage , this has to some extent been due to the absence of workable alternatives rather than to whole-hearted support . parseval / ptb evaluation has several limitations and drawbacks , including a commitment to a particular style of grammatical analysis , and oversensitivity to certain innocuous types of misanalysis while failing to penalise other common types of more serious mistake . also , the original published description of the scheme - - and the evaluation software widely distributed as a follow-up to it - - is specific to the english language . it may be that there are currently no alternative more workable schemes or proposals , but this needs to be more fully discussed : this workshop will provide an opportunity for such a debate . this workshop is particularly timely given the large number of cec language engineering projects that involve parsing in one form or another and which need to evaluate and share the results of their efforts . parsing is an essential part of many larger applications , such as information extraction , which have gained in importance over the last few years . often in such systems , the strength of the parser and grammar has a direct effect on the desired results , and thus achieving good results rests on being able to determine and improve weaknesses in the parser / grammar . without a reliable parser evaluation method this cannot be done effectively . a parsing evaluation workshop is also appropriate at this time given the imminent creation of large-scale syntactically annotated resources for european languages . contributions from those involved in such activities are welcomed , so as to improve communication between the resource construction and the resource utilisation communities . this should ensure that the resources constructed are maximally useful to the general language engineering community . the organisation of this workshop brings together two european language engineering projects which are closely related and whose partners share similar research interests : sparkle and ecran . the organisers solicit contributions from the general community on the following topics : - descriptions of generic syntactic annotation schemes - methodologies and metrics for parsing system evaluation - reports and analyses of the results of utilising particular parser evaluation schemes - description / analysis / experience of language-dependent ( especially for languages other than english ) and task-dependent syntactic annotation schemes programme committee roberto basili gregory grefenstette ted briscoe mark hepple nicoletta calzolari tony mcenery john carroll maria teresa pazienza roberta catizone paola velardi robert gaizauskas yorick wilks paper submission papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . submission may be in either hard copy or electronic form . the submission deadline is february 15th , 1998 . hard copy submission : three copies of the paper should be sent to : dr john carroll cognitive and computing sciences university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh uk electronic submission : electronic submission may be in either self-contained latex , postscript , or rtf formats , to john . carroll @ cogs . susx . ac . uk . for each submission -

"re : prosym license hi karolina , the last word i got was that grant masson was still coordinating the contract and would be the person to talk to about getting a copy of the license . i checked to see if i had an electronic copy somewhere , but couldn ' t find anything . i suspect my copy was paper , and it would have been returned to grant when i went back to portland general electric . probably didn ' t speak to the situation in london , anyway , because the real interest in london didn ' t arise until after i would have gotten my copy . grant is transitioning to his new job with el paso in london , so if you have difficulty reaching him , check with vince kaminski , or if vince is unavailable , shriley crenshaw . shirley may know the person in enron legal or contracts admin . who worked with grant on the henwood license . of course , eric t . would have a copy . if you run into problems with houston , have eric send you a fax . ( the license is relatively short as contracts go . ) hope this helps , michael > > > karolina potter / lon / ect @ enron 10 / 18 / 00 07 : 44 am > > > michael two weeks ago i attended hesi client symposium followed by advanced prosym course in sacramento . during that time i had an opportunity to get to know several people from both henwood energy services support and development groups . one of them was eric toolson - head of client support in hesi , with whom i discussed some issues in regards to our liaison with london based support team . i agreed to meet up with simon crisp back in london to agree on a form of our working relationship . before i go to the meeting i would like to find out the following : the text of enron ' s prosym license what service we are entitled to based on the license i am not sure if you are the person to ask about the above but if you could help me by either providing the license or directing to the appropriate person within enron it would be much appreciated . many thanks karolina",Safe Email

"" well , i had 196 orders for = report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march = 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in = every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . = 20 always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i ' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! "" threw it away "" "" i had received this program before . i threw it away , but later wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get a copy , so i had to wait until i was emailed another copy of the program . eleven months passed , then it came . i didn ' t throw this one away . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try . "" dawn w . , evansville , in "" no free lunch "" "" my late father always told me , ' remember , alan , there is no free lunch in life . you get out of life what you put into it . ' through trial and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start , i finally figured it out . the program works very well , i just had to find the right target group of people to email it to . so far this year , i have made over $ 63 , 000 using this program . i know my dad would have been very proud of me . "" alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . = 20 any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to = will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for = a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do = that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is = practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it !

Date: Not suppliedThe WSJ has published a round-up of phone companies, wired and wireless, 
ranking them based on performance and price. They don't mention Nextel, whose 
hullking milspec i700 handset I've been carrying for years now, with incredible 
reception all over the US and Canada. Their front-line customer service sucks, 
but the prices and network can't be beat.     T-Mobile is in the midst of a massive makeover. In recent months, the 
    company changed its name and launched an ad campaign featuring Ms. Zeta 
    Jones.     The company has a history worth hiding. T-Mobile, a subsidiary of Deutsche 
    Telekom, is known for having a weak national network, and the FCC received 
    1,466 complaints about the company in the past year, giving it one of the 
    worst complaint rates in the industry. T-Mobile says their complaint rate 
    has tapered off and that they have made substantial network improvements.     But T-Mobile is the cheapest wireless provider, available, with an average 
    cost of just 8.2 cents per minute. (Verizon, by contrast, costs 14.3 cents 
    per minute.)  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via Camworld[3]_)[1] http://www.msnbc.com/news/816517.asp

folks went out and did the permit dance.   So where in the article is
this again?Lets get something straight here.   This -is- a First Amendment issue.
Public streets, provided one isn't blocking traffic, generally tend to
be sorta ok, at least from my last interpretation of Con Law a few
years ago (I'll feign ignorance wrt the fact that laws may have
changed, and the specific facts in this case are weak).    IF this guy
_was_ merely holding a sign (which it seems was the case for all the
pro-bush folks) he did nothing wrong.  He certainly didn't do enough
of a wrong to warrant a disorderly conduct charge.I'll play with your perspective though.   Lets assume a few things.
If I walk into the city office and tell them I want to peacably
assemble against Bush, do you think they'll give me a permit?
Probably not.   So I lie.   Then the cop does what happened in this
scenario.  HE walks up, checks my permit and finds out that I
falsified my statement to get this said document.   He arrests me.

down has grown to become the answer because the government, over a
span of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the
rights we have as citizens under the First Amendment.    If you
question the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in
general, you're aiding terrorism.   If you challenge the beliefs of
the folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you're an
anarchist, and you're herded off to a 'designated protest spot' miles
away from anything.   Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-.
I can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thats
speech, its not effective speech.  People are screaming and shouting
over the political figures because they cannot be  heard in any other
way.

an unknown audience, if you're miles from where the audience is?   How
do you bypass the rules for being -miles- away from the audience
without violating the rules of the regime?  I don't think Mr. Nell was
throwing pies at Bush.  A sign, the last time I checked, didn't cause
physical injury, or even emotional harm.  If I remember Cohen v.
California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), its not the individual speaking that
has the requirement to desist, but the individual listening who has
the option to leave.
Just my .02, while its still considered legal.

There are specific statutory exemptions to the ""first sale"" principle of
fair use in the US.  For example, audio recordings have such an
exemption (dating from the early '80s IIRC), which is why you can't
(legally) be in the business of renting audio CDs; the creators can
control what you do with it after they've sold it to you.  Certain
industries would like to extend similar exemptions to other products --
there is no theoretical limit to what Congress could revoke such
privileges on.

The problem with the entertainment industry is that they engage in
business and pricing tactics that make anything Microsoft was ever
accused of pale in comparison.  If they can't figure out how to make
money doing something, they'll actually burn money to make sure no
""industry outsider"" can either for all intents and purposes; control is
more important than maximizing profit as long as they can make a
profit.  They don't need your carrot, so they only engage in reasonable
business behavior when you are carrying a very large stick, and few
people swing a stick large enough.  They are being chronically
""investigated"" by the DoJ for anti-trust, collusion, and similar
activities, but that is mostly just for show.Which isn't to say that the entertainment industry won't fall victim to
its own stupidity, but their ability to do arbitrary and capricious
price manipulation with impunity is going to make it a slow decline.-James Rogers

"western issues update 9 - 04 - 2001 for questions or comments on this report please contact g . britt whitman at ex : 54014 or kristin walsh at ex : 39510 . executive summary ? northwest smelters jockey for favorable rates ? bc hydro ' s rate freeze lingers ? bpa rates expected to rise , california refunds doubtful aluminum smelters ( dsi ' s ) on 1 october 2001 the long - term relationship between dsi ' s and bpa for preferred rates will end as bonneville power administration ' s new rate case takes effect . after 2001 , dsi ' s become discretionary customers of bonneville power administration . dsi ' s have been playing the game of slowly ' migrating ' their load to local utilities in 9 . 9 mw annual increments to avoid being subject to bonneville ' s new large single load ( nlsl ) designation and losing their preferred rate status . now they are beginning to slip quietly back onto bpa ' s federal system , and officials at bonneville have been willing partners in attempting to circumvent their own nlsl regulations , which were established in 1980 . in an effort to secure existing dsi relationships , bpa is now undertaking a review of its nlsl regulation to provide an exemption for these companies . bpa is opposed by the public power council , the representative of the public utilities in the pacific northwest that focuses bpa rate - making , which has sent a letter to the assistant secretary of energy to express its objections to bpa ' s proposed actions . the ppc was instrumental in raising public awareness earlier this year about the favored status of the dsi ' s as large industrial customers - they are moving aggressively to block bpa from giving the aluminum smelters any additional favored treatment . the ability of bpa to exempt dsi ' s from its nlsl regulation will shape the direction of negotiations between aluminum smelters and other power producers in the region . it remains to be seen whether or not the public power council will initiate a legal battle to stop the dsi ' s from obtaining this special treatment . while moving to maintain positive relationships with the dsi ' s , bpa is not enthusiastic about giving power back to the smelters because they think they will need all the water they can spare for the fish . bpa has concerns that supplies will be tight again in the fall and early winter - they won ' t really benefit much , even from normal or better precipitation , until the melt starts next april . bpa wants to buy back power from the smelters for at least a year and probably would not entertain any overtures from smelters until then . about the only possibility for smelters to go back on line would be for them to use the money they ' re getting from bpa to subsidize power purchases on the spot market . however , there would be a lot of risk in that , and bpa people don ' t think market prices would enable them to be very profitable , even with the bpa money helping . as of april 1 , three smelters should come back on line ; nw aluminum , goldendale aluminum , longville aluminum ? alcoa aluminum there is not much news happening on the negotiating end between alcoa and bc hydro right now . information is still fairly tight - lipped , however , employees of alcoa ' s idled intalco smelter have been shifted to other capital projects in the facility to prepare the plant for an eventual restart . this may indicate the direction of negotiations . ? kaiser aluminum as odd man out , kaiser has little to say in northwestern energy developments . the company will obviously benefit if bonneville is able to fight off the public utilities , but they are in such a weak bargaining position right now that they might have to restart operations just to get revenues moving again , though there is no direct evidence to support this view at this time . british columbia politics ? bc government the latest news from british columbia is that the bc liberal government is doing quite nicely in implementing its conservative strategy . public opinion remains quite high , and they have virtually completed all of their campaign promises for the first 90 - day period . even former ndp legislators are surprised at the efficiency with which the government is proceeding . political strategists are watching the anwr vote in the us very carefully , not only because it will have a major impact on the natural gas and oil pipeline going through northern bc , but also because it is illustrating the environment vs . labor fallout . in the recent election , the green party of british columbia performed surprisingly well , garnering around 12 % of the vote in any typical race , contributing directly to the downfall of the ndp . premier gordon campbell ' s core review of bc government is due by october , and it appears that the process will be primarily a cost - cutting measure . they are moving to reduce expenditures , which for bc hydro ' s sake , will include community outreach , student scholarship and any other ' feel good ' programs currently being undertaken by hydro . the real long - term policy planning , however , is expected to take place in january when campbell ' s team ( brenda eaton , the deputy premiere ; doug allen , the premiere ' s consultant ; and jack ebbels , deputy energy minister ) works in conjunction with neufeld to construct bc ' s long - term energy plan . bc hydro bc hydro has formally signed on as a participant in the rto west regional transmission organization as a filing utility . rto west is currently being overseen by the western governor ' s association and developed as allowed by ferc . rto west will be the oversight entity in the western states and canada that will manage electricity transmission issues . we are also expecting alberta to come on board rto west shortly . with regard to a potential rate hearing , bc hydro has recently put a freeze on rates in the province that will last until 2003 . the word on this move is that it will allow chairman bell to generate some political cover as he begins to shave off parts of the business , such as transmission and information technology - focusing bc hydro ' s core operations on additional generation , exports / trading , and delivery . the public concern over privatization is that it will cause rates to skyrocket , similar to what happened in california - but bell has moved to head off these concerns with the rate freeze . as a function of increasing bc hydro ' s generation capacity , they are looking very carefully at building on two sites : site c ( hydroelectric dam ) and burrard thermal . bpa ? financial status in what was expected to be a quiet period in rates matters , bpa dropped a bombshell by announcing it was considering triggering the fb crac on 1 october . this would increase rates over the 46 % lb crac rate increase announced earlier - - despite forecasts that such an increase would be unnecessary . what this essentially does is allow bpa to bypass its initial rate case increase of 46 % , utilizing a stop - gap measure under federal regulations . bpa cited a number of reasons why it was considering imposing an fb crac , including losses trading power this summer , changes in the accounting treatment of some dsi buyouts , and uncertainty whether the california iso and px can pay monies owed bpa . bpa did note , however , that it also had more than one hundred million additional dollars in bond refinancing money not accounted in the fb crac calculation . if the fb crac triggers by any amount , bpa would have the option of "" truing up "" its calculation of the fb crac in march and could change the rates again if bpa ' s actual financial condition on 30 september differs from what is estimated now , or if bpa changes its accounting assumptions further . bpa representatives suggest strongly that there is a good chance that a rate increase would be announced early and also indicated that the specific number would be much less than the earlier load - based crac increase ( of about 46 % ) - - "" much less than 20 % , and probably much , much less than 20 % . "" the public power council staff has written to and met with steve wright , bpa acting administrator , in an effort to convince bpa that a fc crac is unnecessary . we should know bpa ' s decision by 31 august . ? ferc refunds at this time , bpa will not seek refunds in the ongoing ferc proceedings - or submit to the process for purposes of others seeking refunds against bpa - for the following reasons : 1 ) bpa believes ferc lacks jurisdiction over bpa . 2 ) the proceedings are so convoluted ( and the transactions so complicated ) that bpa asserts that there is no realistic hope of unwinding all of the transactions necessary to equitably order refunds . insofar as other parties collecting against bpa , in some cases bpa was only the remarketing agent acting at the behest of , for example , aluminum smelters . ferc would have to proceed against these third parties , and often that money has already been spent . 3 ) with respect to claims by the calif . dwr ( $ 71 million ) , a similar claim in the separate california ferc proceeding was disallowed on 14 june . it would be incongruous to allow the claim here . in this claim , ferc denied dwr access to refunds in situations where there was a willing buyer and willing seller . 4 ) then there are the assorted politics involved . first , bpa believes that the political costs of pursuing refunds outweigh any eventual benefit that might be received . bpa calculates its potential exposure in these refund proceedings at circa $ 400 million , while it believes its own potential claims could amount to $ 500 million - thus a potential $ 100 million net gain . for reasons cited , however , we believe it highly unlikely they will seek refunds . second , with respect to others seeking refunds against bpa , five nw senators who sit on the senate energy committee would be very upset if ferc allowed california parties to collect against bpa ; and ferc to some extent is likely to be responsive to this sentiment . bpa is confident of its legal position in this matter estimating less than a 10 % chance of their being forced to submit to ferc in this matter . of course , if they were forced to submit to ferc jurisdiction , they would cross claim against other parties and seek refunds . even if bpa received refunds , we do not believe that it would affect the ability of aluminum smelters to come back on - line . we anticipate that on 1 april 2002 , three smelters ( amounting to between 300 - 500 mw ) will come back on line : northwest aluminum & goldendale aluminum ( 230 mw ) , and longville aluminum ( 100 mw ) . ? spill - related issues fish returns for this year have been especially high . if the ocean stays productive for the next few years , as some think it might , the region could have an enormous opportunity to rebuild the salmon and steelhead runs and make huge strides towards success in this area . behind - the - scenes work continues on the implementation plan ( on the biological opinion on the hydro system ) , with the region ' s states and tribes trying to play a stronger role in designing the columbia river strategy . ppc and northwest irrigation utilities were admitted to the national wildlife federation et al v . nmfs lawsuit as defendant interveners , and the court is now making plans to try mediation between the parties .",Safe Email

"The Scotsman Thu 22 Aug 2002  Meaningful sentences 
 
 Tracey Lawson 
 
 
 If you ever wanted to look like ""one of the most dangerous inmates in prison
 history"", as one judge described Charles Bronson, nowÂ’s your chance. Bronson -
 the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and
 fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary
 muscle power. 
 
 Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,
 has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he
 has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a
 day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at
 virtually no cost. 
 
 The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a
 fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and
 starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the
 exercise industry. 
 
 ""I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,"" is the
 opening paragraph penned by Bronson. ""ItÂ’s a joke and a big con and they call
 me a criminal!"" You canÂ’t help feeling he has a point. 
 
 This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having
 already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems
 created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to
 discover creative expression while residing at Her MajestyÂ’s pleasure. 
 
 Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents
 when he was sent to Barlinnie PrisonÂ’s famous special unit, which aimed to
 help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to
 express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the
 murder of ""Babs"" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he
 has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was
 published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an
 award-winning film. 
 
 Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in
 Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison
 officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being
 transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and
 developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,
 a frank account of GlasgowÂ’s criminal culture in the 1960s, which received
 critical praise. 
 
 And Lord Archer doesnÂ’t seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books
 that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book
 deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported Â£10 million, and is no doubt
 scribbling away as we speak. 
 
 So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so
 destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck
 on the inside? Steve Richards, BronsonÂ’s publisher, has published many books
 about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both
 pragmatic and profound. 
 
 He says: ""Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have
 known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the
 chance to focus on their creative skills. 
 
 ""It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an
 education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time
 anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents."" 
 
 However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:
 ""Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine
 the very essence of who they are. 
 
 ""They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or
 am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something
 good?"" 
 
 Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that
 of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered
 mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed
 robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term
 over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was
 jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly
 two days during a jail siege. 
 
 Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is
 renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands
 and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: ""I can hit
 a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds."" 
 
 But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary
 Fitness might be the book which will see BronsonÂ’s face sitting on every
 coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which
 so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because
 Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. 
 
 ""All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, itÂ’s just a load of
 bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket,"" he writes, in what can only be
 described as a refreshingly honest style. ""We can all be fat lazy bastards,
 itÂ’s our choice, IÂ’m sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff
 your face with shit you become shit, thatÂ’s logical to me."" 
 
 As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside
 we all needed. 
 
 
 Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will
 be available in bookstores from October at Â£7.99

to spread FUD about the viral nature of the GPL to make CEO/CIO level people
(often not the most technically clueful, even the CIOs) fear that if they so
much as use a Linux box, as, say, a print server, they'll have to make their
company's entire IP public. (I don't think Microsoft said precisely what I
jsut said, but that was the tenor of the remarks). And their marketing
budget is a tad bigger than yours or mine.Niall--

"speaking through the silence , laine a . berman speaking through the silence : narratives , social conventions , and power in java laine a . berman , school of australian and international studies , deakin university uncovering the structures and functions of conversational narratives uttered within natural social networks , laine berman shows how working-class javanese women discursively construct identity and meaning within the rigid constraints of an hierarchical social order . she does this by identifying the silences , the "" unsaid "" , and by revealing both the structure and function of silence in terms of its indexical reference to local meaning . it is here that the force of the javanese language as used in everyday interaction shows itself to be an extremely potent philosophical entity as well as a means of social control . thus , at least in regard to the urban poor , the book boldly questions the difference between traditional definitions of javanese elegance and oppression . this study will contribute to our understanding of the social consequences of language use , to the linguistic knowledge of indonesia and java , and to such basic linguistic issues as narrative structure and function , speech levels and styles , and indexicality features .

Hi Folks,I've been trying to set a button called which automatically
forwards mail using a '-form mycomps' without going through
the editor, but so far haven't got the right recipe.I currently have in my .exmh-defaults:*Mops.spam.text:        Spam
*Mops.spam.command:     Msg_Forward -form spamcomps -noedit -nowhatnowproc ; Msg
_Remove
I've also tried with ""SeditSend {$draft $t 0}"" after the forward command.
It should forward to a spam address (where filters get adjusted) and then
delete.  It does so, but not without producing the edit window.Any help appreciated.Wendy Roberts===========================================

"I don't see why not John, but I'd sure backup my data first ;--)So I suppose you could setup half of the raid1, copy your partitions across,
vi lilo to append the new device labels, /dev/md0 instead of /dev/hda...
re-run lilo, then raidhotadd /dev/xxx /dev/md0 [or is that the other way
around?]I have never tried this so this could be bollix, I have setup root-raid
systems but during install time, I have had drive failures on my
""production"" systems at home and successfully re-built the raid many times.
IMHO linux software raid is extremely good.When are we going to have a pint? CW--------------------------
 I've a running system, and I want to set it up so that the disks are
mirrored. I'll win a little more read speed, and a lot more reliability. However, the RAID_HOWTO just mentions RAID 1 and RAID 0 on a machine
that's new. They don't mention anything about an existing setup. Is it
possible to setup disk mirroring on a running box ?Kate

Dear Friend
 
 I am the first son of the late Mobutu Sese Seko, the
former
 President 
 of the Congo Republic. I am presently under
protective custody
 in Nigeria
 as
a political refugee. I got your contact over the internet during my
search for a
 stranger
 that
can cooperate with me in this mutual transaction.i took this option because my family friends and associates cpuld not be trusted any more since they contributed to my present predicament.
 
I want you to note that this business will benefit
both of us.
 However, 
you must confirm your ability to handle this because
it involves
 a large
amount of money. The money (50 million US DOLLARS is
my share of
 my
 father's
estate. I boxed and shipped the money to a security
company
 abroad at the
peak of the war/political crisis that rocked my
country few
 years ago. Now
the crisis has ended and I need a trustworthy person
like you to
 proceed to
the place of the security company in order to clear
the fund and
 invest on
my behalf as I dont want my name to be used for now.
 
Note that I will send to you the relevant documents
that will
 enable 
you take possesion of the the fund for onward
investment for our
 mutual 
benefit. All I need from you is as follows:1. A letter of committment (duely signed) that you
will keep the
transaction strictly confidential.
2. Your confirmation of your ability to handle this.
3. Your international identity or driving licence
number for
 identification
to the security company.
4. Your telephone and fax numbers for communication.
5. Your full permanent address.
 
As soon as I get the above information from you, I
will disclose
 to 
you the name and the country of the security company.
I will
 forward your
name and particulars to the security company to enable
 them contact you
accordingly. I will also send to you a LETTER OF
AUTHORITY to
 enable you
clear the fund on my behalf. Note that this is a very
safe
 transaction as
this money is my share of my father'sestate.
 
 I am waiting for your response to enable us proceed.

[ n + v ] v verbal compounding in catalan to be more clear we enumerate the relevant characteristics of our compounds . 1 . first of all , we must say that catalan is a vo language . 2 . our compounding looks like a process of noun incorporation where the incorporated noun within the lexical item is the ineternal argument in the syntactic structure . see ( 1 ) : ( 1 ) a . el cacador trenca la cama de l ' ocell . the hunter breaks the leg of the bird b . el cacador camtrenca l ' ocell . the hunter leg + breaks the bird 3 . nevertheless , the noun-incorporation doestn ' t affect to the capacity of the verb of assigning acusative case , this is , the complex verb remains transitive . 4 . this kind of "" noun-incorporation "" is only possible when the noun incorporated is a in inalienable possession noun ( ipn ) and the new internal argument of the complex verb is the possessor . see ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) : ( 2 ) a . corferir to heat + hurt b . colltorcer to neck + twist ( 3 ) a . * cadiratrencar to chair + break * ferrotorcer to iron + twist 5 . we hypothesise that the ipn acsts as a kind of modifier in the complex verbal form and it does n't act as a verbal argument "" most of the people gave us references , they are listed below . most of the answers coincide with the belief that this kind of verbal compounds are backformations from adjectives ( in - er ) or nominal compounds . then "" to baby sit "" comes from "" baby sitter "" for example . another repeated idea is that they are n't productive in languages as english , or romance languages . nevertheless , we still claim that both questions , the productiviy and the backformation , are not so clear in catalan . bertienetto notes that maybe there is a relation between this kind of nominal incorporation and a progressive aspect ( it has been also noted in the literature about the theme ; see , for example miller g .

"sum : c gemination ( syntactic ) content - length : 10885 summary of data on syntactic gemination of consonants a couple of weeks ago i posted a query on what i termed "" syntactic gemination "" , for which i got information from no fewer than 15 respondents . i am very grateful to them all . here they are , listed in alphabetical order : list of the 15 respondents : prathima christdas ( prathima . christdas @ um . cc . umich . edu ) vincent decaen ( decaen @ epas . utoronto . ca ) lance eccles ( lance . eccles @ mq . edu . au ) maik gibson ( llrgbson @ reading . ac . uk ) david gil ( ellgild @ nusvm . bitnet ) ralf grosserhode ( afrikanistik2 @ uni-bayreuth . de ) jacques guy ( j . guy @ trl . oz . au ) marcia haag ( haag @ monk . nhn . uoknor . edu ) mark robert hale ( hale1 @ alcor . concordia . ca ) bruce nevin ( bnevin @ lightstream . com ) john phillips ( john @ ccyi . ccy . yamaguchi-u . ac . jp ) mari siiroinen ( siiroinen @ cc . helsinki . fi ) norbert strade ( lingnost @ hum . aau . dk ) mark verhijde ( mark . verhyde @ let . ruu . nl ) caroline r . wiltshire ( wiltshir @ minerva . cis . yale . edu ) the term "" syntactic gemination "" was not specific enough , as i had in mind only gemination at word boundaries , and not word-internal gemination at morpheme boundaries . nevertheless i will mention such cases as have been pointed out by respondents . besides , in my haste , i had forgotten to mention classical greek , which i had also taken into account in the preliminary version of my paper . here are the data : a syntactic gemination at word-boundary a . 1 - italian this is the "" raddoppiamento sintattico "" of central and southern italian . nevertheless the conditions under which this appears seem to vary considerably among the dialects ( and the speakers ? ) . for instance , the example "" a casa "" [ a ' kkasa ] , taken from lepschy & lepschy ( 1981 ) is not accepted in the dialect of an italian colleague at my university . a . 2 & a . 3 - biblical hebrew and phenician in these languages the definite article / ha / triggers gemination of the initial consonant of the following word ( except for certain consonants ) . for instance , in bh , we have / su : s / ( horse ) , but / ha ssu : s / ( the horse ) . the same would seem to apply to phenician ( see the grammars by segert , van den branden ) , although we have only one epigraphic attestation in punic . the explanation is that a proto-article is reconstructed as * / han / or * / hal / , so that * / hal su : s / ) * / has su : s / , then reinterpreted as / ha ssu : s / . this hypothesis has been connected with the arabic data : the final c of the article / ? al / is assimilated to the initial c of the following word ( at least for the socalled "" sun "" cs ) . for instance : / ? as samak / ( the f ish ) . 46or arabic , gibson adds this : in tunisian arabic there is a clearer case ( @ is schwa ) : shaaf - @ t 's aw - 3sf ' "" she saw "" shaaf - @ tt-u 's aw - 3sf-3sm ' "" she saw him "" the doubling is done to maintain syllable structure , but this is not the20 normal way . we would normally expect the elision of @ , to shaaf-t - u , but20 this does not happen in the 3s feminine past . a . 4 - classical greek in attic greek word-initial / r - / goes to / rr - / under certain conditions after a word ending in a short final v . in epic texts , or in other dialects , this gemination is extended to other sonants : / l - , m - , n - / . we even find / pp - / attested in boeotian these four languages were the only instances known to me when i posted the query . incidentally , note that they are different from the cases of latin "" hic "" and "" hoc "" , which were pronounced / hikk / and / hokk / before a word beginning with a v . the form / hokk / is original ( and / hikk / analogically modelled after it ) , so that diachrony forces us to say that / hokk / is simplified into / hok / before a c - initial word . here are now the additional data kindly supplied by my respondents , which i paste freely . a . 5 - finnish ( eccles , siiroinen , strade ) there is consonant gemination at word boundaries in certain cases in finnish . it is morphologically conditioned though it is "" syntactic "" . several morphemes or forms trigger it : imperative 2nd person singular ( ota ' take ' / otas se ' take it ' ) , allative case ( annan sinulle ' i - give to-you ' / annan sinullek kirjan ' i - give to-you a book ' ) , most of the nouns ending in - e ( kirje ' a letter ' / kirjet tuli ' a letter arrived ' ) and so on . other examples : in some negative forms : * en mene sinne * ( i do n't go there ) , pronounced20 * en menes sinne * negation + v - stem + there verb ( go ) 20 1 . sg . the same in imperative : * a "" la "" mene sinne * ( do n't go there ! ) , 20 pronounced : 20 * a "" la "" menes sinne * neg . verb imp . 2 . sg . also in the so called "" 1 . infinitive "" : * ha "" nen pita "" isi tulla ta "" nne * ( he / she ought to20 come here ) , pron : * . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . tullat ta "" nne * 20 inf . 1 here 20 the background for this gemination is the historical loss of a final consonant in the suffix-less verbal stem and in the mentioned infinitive form . this consonant was assimilated to a following consonant . while it disappeared without any trace in an end position or in front of a vowel , the gemination of the following consonant was retained . this feature is n't marked in orthography . a . 6 & a . 7 - tamil and malayalam ( christdas , wiltshire ) tamil has gemination of word initial stops following words with some case markings ( accusative at least ) . a brief account can be found in christdas , prathima ( 1987 ) "" on constraining the power of lexical phonology : evidence from tamil "" in mcdonough , j . and plunkett ( eds ) proceedings of nels 17 , volume 1 : 122-146 . 20 syntactic gemination is also found in malayalam , a closely related language . a . 8 - celtic languages ( phillips ) the celtic languages have "" mutations "" , changes to the beginnings of words due to their syntactic environment . types of mutations include prefixing of h or n to a vowel and voicing , devoicing , nasalising , etc . , of consonants . one of the mutations in old irish was gemination . the welsh spirant mutation is historically cognate with irish gemination , e . g . ci "" dog "" , but tri chi "" three dogs "" , cath a chi "" a cat and a dog "" , though gemination in old irish occurred in a much wider range of environments . some of the mutations in breton are realised phonetically as gemination , though spelt otherwise . on other cases of c - mutation , see the mention by verhijede below ( fulla , southern paiute ) . a . 9 - the kelantan dialect of malay ( gil ) in the kelantan dialect of malay , agents of passive clauses ( ie . "" by "" - phrases ) are marked not with a preposition ( as in standard malay ) , but , rather , by gemination of the initial consonant . cb : if i understand this correctly , the preposition has been ellipted ? b - word - internal syntactic gemination word - internal syntactic gemination seems to be widespread , probably more than gemination at word-boundary . as pointed out by nevin , in many languages , some phonotactic effects apply only in certain syntactically defined domains , for example , in roots or in verb stems , but not in affixes . hale adds that the number of languages which show this process is quite large . for instance there are some oceanic examples . at any rate , both sanskrit and ( if the meter is to be believed ) and preclassical ( homeric ) greek show such processes . here are a few specific instances : b . 1 - classical greek word - internal / r / is geminated to / rr / after the augment or after a vowel in compounds , variably . b . 2 - choctaw ( haag ) choctaw ( a muskogean lg of n . america ) has an inflectional form ( for aspect marking ) that involves deformation of the stem such that a medial consonant is geminated , or / y / is inserted an geminated if there are not the requisite number of syllables . so we have falama ` return ' becoming fallaama ` finally return ' while ala ` arrive ' becomes ayyaala ` finally arriv e ' . b . 2 - sakao ( guy ) sakao is a language spoken at espiritu santo , , in vanuatu ( formerly new - hebrides ) . when the direct object is incorporated in the verb , the initial c of the verb is geminated . examples , with son 3d to hunt / shoot with a bow , enes 3d fish : moson enes 3d he is fishing fish with a bow ( now ) but : mossones 3d he fishes fish with a bow ( generally ) , il peche a l ' arc analysis : mv - 3eme p . sg . realis sson20 nes ( ( enes with disappearance of the compulsory article v - , then simplification of the two n 's inro one n ) nb : o 3d open o ( ipa "" open o "" in pullum & ladusaw , p . 117 ) e 3d open e ( ipa epsilon ) b . 3 - biblical hebrew gil adds this on hebrew : in biblical hebrew the 2nd binyan ( "" pi99el "" ) is formed by reduplication of the 2nd root consonant , together with the appropriate choice of vowels . now in most part , the binyan system is considered "" derivational "" and hence not , strictly speaking , syntactic ; however , in some cases , the 2nd binyan is the "" transitive "" or "" causitive "" of the first , in which case gemination ( plus vowel pattern ) does have a syntactic function . let me end by a more theoretical note , quoting verhijde : your question touches upon the fields of interaction between morphology-syntax and phonology ( prosody ) . now as far as i know , all c - gemination is in itself strictly phonological . thus if i understand your question correctly , you wish to find out whether there are languages that appear have morphological / syntactic triggers for c - gemination . there is a huge bulk of material on sandhi - effects , as for example the italian rs case you mentioned in your query . perhaps ellen kaisse ( 1985 ) , _ connected speech _ may be of some help . now with respect to your query : i was thinking ( from a phonological point of view ) that c - gemination is really : share melody . or in more abstract terms : share [ x ] . if this is correct , then for example c - mutation ( like in fula , southern paiute and celtic languages ) under syntactic considerations may become very interesting for you . thans again to all of you who generously answered my question . claude boisson universite lumiere , lyon , france ( claude . boisson @ mrash . fr )",Safe Email

Date: 2002-09-23T16:11:02-05:00Trust me when I tell you that heavy medication and RDF do not mix. Here is a 
list of things I intend to re-read once the fog lifts: - _Phil Ringnalda_: Using FOAF relationships[1] and Just say no to Trackback in 
index.html[2]. 
- _Les Orchard_: Per-post comment RSS feed[3]. 
- _Phil Wainewright_: The bare necessities of RSS[4] and What to do about RDF
[5]. The beginning of an RSS 2.0 best practices document. 
- _Jonathon Delacour_: Trying to score a goal[6]. â€œAs the best and the 
brightest focus on the possibilities of FOAF, I turned my attention to 
yesterday's news: RSS.â€ No, RSS will always be today's news. Get it? 
Today's newzzz... Never mind. 
- Comments on Ben Hammersley's Friend of a Friend[7]. Various ways to link to a 
FOAF file from an RSS feed. 
- _Nicholas Chase_: The Web's future: XHTML 2.0[8]. We're losing backward 
compatibility, isn't that great? Well, he seems to think so. 
- mod_cc[9], a module for including copyright information in RDF documents such 
as RSS 1.0 feeds, and, I hope, FOAF files. 
- _Shelley Powers_: Who is your audience, and what are you trying to 
accomplish?[10] Addressing the growing identity crisis on the RSS-DEV mailing 
list[11]. Also the comments on Shelley's article[12]. 
- _Ian Hickson_: Pingback 1.0[13]. â€œThe best thing about this idea is 
that unlike similar schemes like TrackBack, it is totally transparent to both 
users.â€ 
- New software helps in building of accessible web sites[14]. A press release 
for a new edition of LIFT[15], which I have never used. 
- Forget Mars bars, Twinkies now the deep-fried treat[16]. â€œThe secret to 
making a deep-fried Twinkie, he says, is to place it in the fridge first to 
give it more stability. He then rolls it in flour, covers it with batter ... 
and plunks it into the oil.â€ [1]  http://philringnalda.com/archives/002324.php

Hi,I am experiencing a strange problem since a couple of days now,
I have several folders with unseen sequences, and when there is
new mail they are highlighted. This works fine.But .. since a couple of days the actual inbox won't be highlighted
any more when there is new mail. On the other hand the unseen window
still indicates if there is new mail in the inbox.All other folders seem to work properly.Any hints ?  Marc Baaden--
