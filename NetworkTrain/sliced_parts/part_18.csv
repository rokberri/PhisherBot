"phoentics / phonology : r . goedemans , weightless segments new from holland academic graphics rob goedemans weightless segments a phonetic and phonological study concerning the metrical irrelevance of syllable onsets weightless segments deals with a specific question that arises when we regard the stress rules of quantity-sensitive languages . in these languages , vowels and coda consonants can , by virtue of their presence or absence , influence the weight of the syllable , and thus , indirectly , the location of word stress . it is common knowledge that onset consonants do not have this capacity . the question that this book , researched within the laboratory phonology framework , tries to answer is why . a phonetic explanation for the weightless behaviour of syllable onsets is sought in the durational behaviour of onset , nucleus and coda . assuming that duration is the primary phonetic correlate of phonological weight , an asymmetry in the durational behaviour of these subsyllabic constituents might explain the observed differences in potential weight . a series of production and perception experiments was conducted to reveal this asymmetry , and to explain it . a further task that is undertaken in this book is the reanalysis of a group of , mostly australian aboriginal , languages for which some degree of onset influence in their stress rules has been claimed in the past ( in defiance of the universal rule that onsets do not count ) . in the second part of this book , after a general overview of stress in aboriginal languages , it is shown that these offending languages can all be reanalysed without any reference to onset influence whatsoever . contents : 1 . introduction 2 . onset durations in production experiments 3 . the perception of syllabic duration 4 . exploratory psychophysics 5 . the role of onsets in stress rules 6 . two case studies 7 . conclusions 1998 . viii + 262 pp . isbn : 90 5569 052 x . paperback .

""don't use things like goto and break to alter flow of control
in your program"".  While not valid 100% of the time, it's a 
reasonable rule of thumb.  The idea is that, when looking at
code, it's easier to see how control moves through a 
function if your basic control blocks do all the work.  The
specific example of replacing a break in a while loop with
a modified while() expression shows this.  You only have to
look in one place to see when you'll run off the end of the
loop, not hunt through the whole loop.  (Although that particular
example wasn't really that good, since the extra test was 
adding on (... || done) and setting done = true in the loop.
Which is much the same as a break really.)The idea is to surprise the next programmer as little as 
possible when he sees the code.In a similar vein, having a break in every case of a select
block makes the flow much clearer.  Flow goes in, zero or 
one case blocks are executed and flows comes out the bottom.
Leaving out break statements breaks this assumption.My point is that, while there are a few situations where it
makes sense to leave out the breaks, I usually tend to 
consider the break at the end of each case more like the
brace at the end of the while block.  In fact, maybe it wouldn't have been a bad idea if the language
was designed such that the continue statement meant fall through
and break wasn't needed:   select (x) {
      case 1:
         /* do something - doesn't fall through */
      case 2:
         /* do something - falls through to next case*/
         continue;
      case 3:
         /* do something - doesn't fall through */
      default:
         /* do something - doesn't fall through */
   }Still, hindsight and all that.  Sigh.Later,

"all, I posted the below question to this list so I thought I'd update you all. Thanks for your suggestions.Well, I'd decided to bite the bullet and spend big on a new case and CPU fan.I bought a lian-li aluminum case. It was expensive as cases go (stgÂ£133.86) but I decided, it's a good basis to build any future PC on. It has 4 x 51/4"" drive bays and 6 x 3Â½"" drive bays so I should be ok for future upgrades etc. I have to say it was worth it. Its a pleasure to work on. It has a slide out tray to mount the Mother Board on, both sides come off, the drive bays come out...all without using a screwdriver (thumb screws). Even the edges inside the case are smooth so no banging your hands off shape edges etc. There are 4 fans inside the case, which can be set to 3 different speeds. There are 4 usb ports on the front of the box too. The box is big and has loads of room inside. Oh... and it looks very cool :-)However there are 2 things to look out for. On the Maplins website it says* Up to three 80mm case fans can be fitted! * ATX Power supply sold separatelyIn fact the case came with 4 fans and a power supply, which is great but I ordered 2 fans and a power supply separately. Also the case was a slightly different model to one advertised, as I got the USB model. It does say (Product may vary in design and specification from that show) but I missed that :-)I also bought a Flower Cooler Kit which is completely silent. Very nice.

As the head of a political action group, Krause uses members-only e-mail lists to help educate and organize fellow activists. So she was jarred recently when one message bounced back with a note accusing her of spreading unsolicited junk e-mail, or spam.

Whether out of heartfelt patriotism in the wake of Sept. 11 or the desire to tap into the nearly $38 billion budgeted for homeland security spending in 2003, many information technology companies that previously paid little attention to government contracts are now going to great lengths to attract government business.

Juniper beat estimates by earning less than $500,000, reported a 42 percent decline in year-over-year sales and offered little hope that it could grow its business when it reported 2002 second-quarter earnings on Thursday. Yet in some corners of the industry, Juniper's performance was viewed as mildly positive.

"re : 6 . 100 sum : ipa history & haceks , stemberger suggests that north american linguists who use haceks are following a tradition which is just as international as that of the international phonetic association , which he labels a western european organization . even a cursory glance at the ipa membership list would have shown him that the ipa is an international body , with many north american members . it is governed by an elected council , with over half the members coming from outside western europe , several of the council being from the united states , others from eastern europe ( poland and russia ) , and others from china , japan , australia , finland , south africa , and nigeria . it is the north american linguists who use diverse symbols who are not following truly international conventions . having said that , let me say that i happen to agree with him that it would be appropriate to use haceks for palato-alveolar sounds . the hacek would then be a diacritic marking a natural class of sounds . i proposed this at the 1989 kiel convention of the ipa , but i was voted down by my more conservative colleagues , who consider it important to keep the ipa as stable as possible . i see their point of view , but prefer mine . nevertheless there is no point in having democratically approved international standards unless one keeps to them , so i will reluctantly avoid haceks . peter ladefoged",Safe Email

However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Company.Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.

"western issues update 9 - 07 - 2001 for questions or comments regarding this report please contact g . britt whitman at ex : 5 - 4014 or kristin walsh at ex : 3 - 9510 . executive summary ? british columbian government exploring energy issues ? bc hydro readies itself for transmission line sale ? bpa aborts additional rate increase , refutes california ' s overcharge claims bc government the bc liberals have announced that they are putting together a new policy task force on energy to deal with energy issues going forward . they will be looking at the province ' s energy resources and will be making recommendations in less than six months on the best way to move forward . the task force includes : jack ebbels , deputy minister of the ministry of energy and mines , chair peter meekison , energy policy consultant john bechtold , oil and gas expert erik westergaard , hydroelectricity expert brenda eaton , deputy minister to the premier our information is that the policy task force will look seriously at the offshore drilling and exploration issue and begin to determine timetables to start this process . additionally , the canadians are becoming increasingly rancorous over the 19 . 4 % us tariff on softwood timber exports coming to the states . a bc cabinet minister has made veiled threats to tie canadian energy exports to the united states to eliminating the softwood timber tariff . jean chretien himself has backed away from trade war talks , but intimated that reduction or elimination of the tariff will be critical to moving the oil and natural gas pipeline projects in northern bc along . bc hydro bc hydro chair larry bell is soft - peddling the bc liberals ' message of deregulation . coming under intense scrutiny , bell has already gone public to defend bc hydro ' s rate freeze and has stated that residential distribution and powerex operations will not be deregulated . we noticed , however , that he did not say whether or not information technology and transmission assets would be sold off - which appears is indeed going forth . we believe that bc hydro is in the process of preparing to accept bids for its assets and that a round of open negotiations will begin in the short - to - medium term . two big players to watch on the transmission privatization front are : trans - elect corporation , which has indicated it is watching the british columbia market very carefully and already owns the adjacent transmission lines in calgary ; and transconnect , which has been working with the rto - west group , which could eventually plug bc hydro ' s transmission systems into the rto west grid . bell has been talking about instituting a tiered - rate plan for bc ' s own energy - intensive industries , allowing energy - efficient plants to maintain their preferred rate , increasing rates for others . he is considering allowing private sector generators to sell directly to industry in bc . however , bell has not been as hot on "" clean coal "" generation as neufeld , having suggested that he has not yet seen an application of the technology , which has been economically and environmentally sound . strategically , hydro ' s export plans will likely look to include new partners across the border . from what we are seeing of the new chairman ' s position , it appears that bc hydro will attempt to sever the "" feeling of entitlement "" that bc ' s own energy - intensive industries have relied on . that is , hydro is snooping around the states for greener pastures after having had a taste of the california windfall last year . why commit to providing cheap power to local markets when you could be selling the same power for larger profits elsewhere ? bpa financial conditions to everyone ' s relief , bpa last week announced there would be no additional rate increase . in early august the agency had warned that its pre - third quarter review showed a possibility it would have to trigger the financial - based cost recovery adjustment clause ( fb crac ) , one of three cracs bpa and its customers adopted in the supplemental rate case to cope with erratic power prices . the load - based ( lb ) crac has already driven a 46 percent rate increase , and the fb crac could have added another 4 . 5 mills . but the agency said fresh data put its revenues above the trigger , so there will be no additional rate hike . additionally , we have also heard that bpa is still committed to spending roughly $ 186 million next year on fish and wildlife issues . ferc refunds although bpa has not issued an official statement , as a net supplier to california it is likely that bpa would be opposed to california ' s attempt to recoup over $ 1 . 5 billion in perceived overcharges from the pacific northwest . earlier this year , bpa responded to allegations of overcharging by issuing a rebuttal letter entitled "" bpa response to california iso study "" on 13 april 2001 which maintained that its operations were above reproach . bpa will look to pursue an insurance policy to insulate itself from cal - iso ' s allegations . pacific northwest utilities and other energy - using entities , such as the city of tacoma and the port of seattle , also have joined in the fray to pursue $ 2 billion in perceived overcharges . the name of the game on the west coast is to say that you were a net importer , not a net exporter during the period of time that is under investigation by ferc and the federal judge . everyone is beefing up their argument with load data to show they were actually buyers , not sellers . spill issues the power planning council has recommended spending more than $ 7 million for projects designed to mitigate for emergency power operations during this drought year . most of the funding would go to buy up spawning habitat along a tributary of the john day river in oregon , with $ 1 . 6 million to pay for irrigation screens in the yakima river . the $ 7 million is in addition to $ 24 million the council has already recommended to pay for projects designed to offset the emergency hydro operations that nearly stopped the spill program at main - stem dams . bpa had agreed to fund $ 9 . 3 million worth of the council ' s list . other projects recommended include funding the monitoring and evaluation of a salmon production project in the south fork of idaho ' s clearwater river , spending $ 300 , 000 to improve fish passage in a tributary of oregon ' s umatilla river , and installing stream flow gauges in the entiat , okanogan and wenatchee rivers .",Safe Email

into apt conf on the machines on the network and apt away.As for .fi mirrors, funet is very slow. I think I use tuxfamily for
updates but when I see errata I usually also put that to my own one so
rest of the machines have a shorter path to it.
Funet hosts a whole load of mirrors and projects (it used to be (is?)
the main mirror for Linux. It was one of the big pub ftp sites). If
there was a definite apt repository, maybe they might mirror that as
well. I doubt RH would be very keen on using apt and forking a
distribution doesn't seem like an easy option, someone should just start
a project.--

5 per additional person in room . they are not as nice as the canyon inn rooms , and staying away from the workshop diminishes the coziness of the workshop experience , so we will not use them unless we run out of space at the canyon inn ( and this does not appear to be a problem at the moment ) . if you have to stay there , we will provide transportation to and from the conference site . if you want to stay in bloomington for a few days before or after the workshop , we have blocked some rooms in eigenmann hall , a graduate dormitory with single rooms , on-premises cafeteria , and within walking distance of our library . rooms cost about $ 28 / day ( food is not included ) , and may be paid for by credit card , cash , or checks . you should request these rooms through me in advance of the workshop , specifying arrival and departure dates . food the conference will provide the following meals at no charge to participants ( if you are accompanied by a spouse or children , they are welcome to join us but you must pay for their food ; email me for details ) . it is very important that i have an exact count before the conference , as i must provide this information to the canyon inn , so please keep me informed of your plans friday evening : outdoor picnic dinner ( barbecue chicken and ribs , various other dishes ; vegetarians can feast on salads etc . ; indoors if it rains ) saturday morning : coffee / juice / pastries / fruit at the conference room saturday lunch : buffet with sandwiches , salads , beverages , etc . sunday morning : same as saturday morning . saturday evening and sunday lunch are not provided for . i figure many people might want to go to a restaurant in bloomington , but there is a decent restaurant in the canyon inn as well , and one pleasant-looking hilltop restaurant in spenser as well . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * george fowler [ email ] gfowler @ indiana . edu dept . of slavic languages [ dept . tel . ] 1-812 -

"re : hiring practices for summer interns sally , thanks for the e - mail regarding summer interns . i apologize that lexi and shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking . i wish that you had contacted either celeste or me to indicate that you were having difficulty . i have personally assured you on several occasions that i was available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any member of my staff was not responsive . that being said please allow me to explain the recruiting strategy since i was instrumental in helping to set it . you are absolutely correct . it is great to do market research if time permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge . as you are aware , over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting firm ( brecker & merryman ) who has assisted us in a number of different market research projects . however , in my opinion , this issue is not one that required much research . i have been involved in recruiting in some way , shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10 years . most major organizations , with the exception of the accounting firms , begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring . there are actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns until after a certain date , particularly in the mba programs . for example , harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first year students until january . as indicated , the firms that generally recruit in the fall are the accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for "" spring "" internships . the recruiting strategy at enron is no different this year than it was last year with respect to summer interns . presentations were made in january however , because lexi has other school interviews that are already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview process during the trip you have scheduled currently . as you are aware , in most instances , the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by the respective universities and were secured in early august . if you would like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to support your efforts . i hope this has been helpful . i can understand and appreciate your frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her manager . again , i offer that i am available and willing to work with you if you are having difficulty with members of the program staff . please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer interns and whether i can be of any additional assistance . charlene",Safe Email

"cognitive linguistics theme session call for papers 6th international cognitive linguistics association ( icla ) conference ( stockholm , july 1999 ) typological research on signed languages : cognition and discourse structure session coordinators : sherman wilcox and terry janzen several hundred signed languages are known to exist in the world , used within communities in which the signed language is the primary language . most grammatical description of these languages , however , is not extensive , and is confined to no more than a handful of these languages . there is speculation that signed languages may share a significant number of linguistic features even when such languages are genetically unrelated , due in part to their common use of the hands and body as articulators and the eyes , rather than ears , as perceptual organs . very little actual work , however , has been carried out with respect to which specific grammatical features are shared , and which may differ . many questions surrounding the relationship between cognition and signed language structure involve the cross-linguistic typology of structural and semantic categories . it is not yet clear , however , whether certain linguistic features of signed languages emerge cross-linguistically because users of these languages employ similar articulatory and perceptual systems , and how much variation between and within particular categories exists . the purpose of this session is to focus on information processing and discourse structure as typological features among signed languages . a cognitive approach to this topic assumes that signers will structure their discourse to best represent and convey what is cognitively salient , and that the grammar that emerges within a community of language users will reflect this cognitive motivation . we invite papers which focus on cognition and features of discourse structure in a variety of signed languages , with the intention of facilitating discussion among researchers regarding typological features . abstracts ( 700 to 1400 words ) are invited , and should be submitted by november 31 to each of the following : wilcox @ unm . edu tjanzen @ post . rrcc . mb . ca = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = sherman wilcox , ph . d . associate professor dept . of linguistics university of new mexico albuquerque , nm 87131 http : / / www . unm . edu / ~ wilcox",Safe Email

( one of the reasons people find writing difficult is that they do not feel comfortable with the ' me ' they are portraying in their writing . academic writing in particular often poses a conflict of identity for students in higher education , because the 's elf ' which is inscribed in academic discourse feels alien to them . ) the main claim of this book is that writing is an act of identity in which people align themselves with socio-culturally shaped subject positions , and thereby play their part in reproducing or challenging dominant practices and discourses , and the values , beliefs and interests which they embody . the first part of the book reviews recent understandings of social identity , of the discoursal construction of identity , of literacy and identity , and of issues of identity in research on academic writing . the main part of the book is based on a collaborative research project about writing and identity with mature-age students , providing : o a case study of one writer 's dilemmas over the presentation of self ; o a discussion of the way in which writers ' life histories shape their presentation of self in writing ; o an interview-based study of issues of ownership , and of accommodation and resistance to conventions for the presentation of self ; linguistic analysis of the ways in which multiple , often contradictory , interests , values , beliefs and practices are inscribed in discourse conventions , which set up a range of possibilities for self-hood for writers . the book ends with implications of the study for research on writing and identity , and for the learning and teaching of academic writing . the book will be of interest to students and researchers in the fields of social identity , literacy , discourse analysis , rhetoric and composition studies , and to all those concerned to understand what is involved in academic writing in order to provide wider access to higher education . writing development . an interdisciplinary view edited by : clotilde pontecorvo , universita di roma , "" la sapienza "" , italy 1997 xxxii , 338 pp . studies in written language & literacy , 6 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 324 6 price : us $ 69 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 1799 8 price : nlg 138 john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com this volume presents a selection of papers presented at a series of three workshops organized by the network "" written language and literacy "" as launched by the european science foundation . the main topics making up writing development are : ( 1 ) writing and literacy acquisition : links between speech and writing , with contributions by david r . olson , claire blanche - benveniste , emilia ferreiro , ruth berman , liliana tolchinsky & ana teberosky ; ( 2 ) writing and reading in time and culture , with contributions by collette sirat , francoise desbordes , harmut gunther , peter koch , & jean hebrard : ( 3 ) written language competence in monolingual and bilingual contexts , with contributions by michel fayol & serge mouchon , georges ludi , & ludo verhoeven ; ( 4 ) writing systems , brain structures and languages : a neurolinguistic view , with contributioris by giuseppe cossu , heinz wiimmer & uta frith , & brian butterworth . the volume heads off with an extensive introduction "" studying writing and writing acquisition today : a multidisciplinary view "" . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - bernadette martinez - keck tel : ( 215 ) 836-1200 publicity / marketing fax : ( 215 ) 836-1204 john benjamins north america e-mail : bernie @ benjamins . com po box 27519 philadelphia pa 19118-0519 check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com",Safe Email

"I finally let go of my Irix Magic desktop and window manager
and evaluated several other window managers. Having lost my 10 years
of customization with my X10 and then X11 desktop at one point
at UCI, I promised myself that I'd never get attached to
another WM.  I limped along in the default Gnome desktop, I
had a few unsuccessful stabs at the Solaris open view 
desktop, but nothing really stuck.   Because of this along
with SGI's love of pre-configured, pre-compiled freeware[1],
I never really made the jump from Irix to Linux either.  After installing the enlightenment WM, I have to say, I am
really enlightened.  It's definitely a far cry from the no frills
first look from previous versions.  It's only on version 0.17,[2]
but it's a careful balance between simplicity, performance,
(fun) features, applications, and ease of customization.  The
number of themes they have on freshmeat is amazing. [3] After
less than an hour or two of ""nesting"" I already have almost
all my menus and controls setup just the way I want. I definitely recommend this to any Irix desktop holdouts.  It's
a great way to refresh your machine SGI without having to bite the
bullet and rebuild it as a Linux machine. Greg[1] http://freeware.sgi.com/

) , enron ( ene : baal / bbb + ) and dynegy ( dyn : baa 2 / bbb + ) . we note that most of the generators and marketers with exposure to california have established reserves against possible losses . importantly , the governor said that he hoped that the banks and bondholders would not be asked to take a haircut . prospects for legislation and possibility of ballot initiative the governor said he is quite confident that he can reach an agreement with the utilities that the legislature can support . although he admitted that he couldn ' t prevent someone from proposing a ballot initiative , the governor said that in the end , the acid test with the public is how it affects their pocket books . thus , if there is ultimately a ballot initiative , governor davis is optimistic that the public will be supportive of his plan given the limited impact on electric rates . status of defaulted utility debt as we have commented in the past , it appears unlikely that the resulting legislation will pass with the required 2 / 3 majority to go into effect immediately . accordingly , there will be a several month lag before the utilities receive any cash . in response to a question , it appears that the state will not step in to help the utilities pay off any maturing or defaulted commercial paper . but the governor and his advisers hope that legislation will provide enough certainty so that the companies can get bridge financing . essentially , it appears the governor is leaving it up to the utilities to find the money from their banks . governor ' s strategy to keep the lights on the governor stated that a key reason that deregulation failed in california was that no new power plants were built in the state for over twelve years . in the intervening time , demand caught up with supply . in response , he has proposed various conservation initiatives and is trying to expedite the construction of new power plants . he set a goal of having 20 , 000 megawatts ( mws ) of new supply on line by 2004 . in addition , the governor highlighted the need for additional investment in the transmission infrastructure . in particular , he cited the need to expand the capacity to import more power from arizona as well to improve the ability to move power from south to north within the state . he suggested that part of the rationale for the state taking over the utilities ' transmission grids was to ensure that the additional investment takes place . he also suggested that the state would lease the transmission lines back to the utilities to allow them to continue to operate them . in the meantime , the focus is to move away from california ' s over - reliance on the spot market . in that vein , calpine ( cpn : bal / bb + ) yesterday announced the signing of two long - term contracts with the state ' s department of water resources ( dwr ) . one of those contracts was to sell up to 1 , 000 mws over a ten - year term . the other was to provide up to 495 mw of peaking capacity under a 20 - year contract . earlier in february , cpn had reached agreement with the dwr on a separate 10 - year contract for an additional 1 , 000 mws .

"So, like many young children, my daughter Tatum (age 21 months) *really*
likes music. She also likes to have control over her environment, and this
means she wants to be the one putting CDs into the CD player, and getting
the music playing.By watching Tatum, I've discovered that you can learn a lot about UI design
from watching 21-month-olds use technology. There is definitely a market
niche for a toddler-friendly CD/MP3 player.The CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but
doesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead
requiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UI
disaster. Since Tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses the
button again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She'll only ever
get music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens a
surprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again
when the music doesn't play.For toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately,
within half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press the
button multiple times. As well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn't
change the semantics, like an elevator button. No matter how many times you
press, the elevator still comes to that floor. The play button needs to be
the same.The back-hinged door mechanism feeding the CD into the player is also a UI
disaster for Tatum. Since the door hinges on the back, Tatum has to angle
CDs to put them in, and take them out. Putting CDs in isn't much of a
problem, but taking them out is. Since Tatum grabs CDs by the back edge,
that edge comes out first, hitting the lid. Tatum eventually forces and
wiggles the CD out, a process that's hard on the CD and the player (but
which hasn't yet resulted in the CD player being broken). Surprisingly, it
hasn't been a problem getting the CD hole onto the spindle -- Tatum seems to
understand this concept, and the CD load area geometry naturally guides the
CD.Tatum's CD player also plays tapes and has FM radio. For a toddler, this is
a mistake. Tatum doesn't understand the need to flick a switch to put the
player into a specific mode. She understands putting a CD in, and pressing
the play button. She sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song,
but uses them erratically. As well, the radio feature has both FM mono and
FM stero, a distinction totally lost on Tatum. Tatum only understands the
binary distinction of music/no music.What would the ideal toddler CD player be like? It would immediately start
playing a CD after it was loaded. As soon as the CD load door was closed, it
would give some audible feedback. It would have a single large play button.
The other typical CD controls would be larger than normal, but at least half
the size of the play button, and located far away from the play button, so
there is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play.
The play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of
the player, and different from the color of the other CD control keys. The
device would only play CDs, no other functions. The CD load area would flip
open at least 80 degrees. It should be small, approachable for a toddler. It
should be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 1-2'
without affecting the player.- Jim

But that obscures the different modes of promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for money or power or companionship and the person who uses money and power and companionship to get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense of the word. But their motives and behavior are quite different.Langur monkeys were the example in the cited article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey .. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But cozying up to the current dominant male isn't the best strategy for female langurs, because ""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every 27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many extra-group males as possible, female langurs ensure their offspring against infanticide,"" by the male who is likely next to rule the roost.Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a picture of carefree females engaged in joyously promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a better picture of that. ;-)_________________________________________________________________ Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: http://messenger.msn.com",Safe Email

 University boom creates era of sexual tolerance By Helen Rumbelow
 
 
 
 THE boom in university education has led to a sea change in BritainÂ’s
 tolerance of homosexuality, according to a report. Just under half the people
 now believe that homosexuality is always or mostly wrong, down from three
 quarters 15 years ago, according to the British Social Attitudes survey,
 regarded as one of the best indicators of popular opinion. 
 
 That trend is mirrored by the attitude towards ethnic minorities, with 75 per
 cent of people now saying they are not at all racially prejudiced, compared
 with 60 per cent in 1987. 
 
 Geoffrey Evans, a politics professor at Oxford University, decided to focus on
 what has caused Britain to become more open-minded in a report published
 today. The study, from the National Centre for Social Research, is based on
 interviews with a cross-section of 3,500 people. 
 
 Young people are much more tolerant than their elders, with a quarter of
 twentysomethings believing that homosexual sex is always wrong, compared with
 two thirds of pensioners. 
 
 But the key to converting a bigot is to send him or her to college, with
 graduates twice as accepting of homosexuals as those with no GCSEs, and a
 third less racist. 
 
 That transformation happened no matter what social class the student came from
 and, with 41 per cent of young people now attending university, it was a
 powerful social effect, Professor Evans said. 
 
 Â“Mr BlairÂ’s famous mantra Â‘education, education, educationÂ’ seems far less
 consequential now than when first announced in 1997, as Britain struggles with
 an overburdened health service and the reality that as more and more people
 get degrees, degrees buy less and less,Â” he said. 
 
 Â“But the growth of higher education can provide a bulwark against the
 undermining of liberal democracy through intolerance,Â” he added. 
 
 He decided to see whether the tolerance conferred by schooling was just
 Â“political correctnessÂ” by testing how many civil rights the educated would
 give to an unattractive minority: white supremacists. 
 
 Again, people scored higher the longer they had spent at school and
 university, with nearly two thirds of graduates saying that white supremacists
 should have the right to give television interviews or stand in elections,
 three times as many as those with no qualifications. 
 
 It is not clear why those with higher education are more tolerant, the report
 says, adding that it may be simply because university students have increased
 contact with alternative points of view. 
 
 Professor Evans also looked at whether the young may grow out of their
 idealism, but found the opposite to be true. 
 
 Thirtysomethings were more than twice as likely to say there was nothing wrong
 with homosexuality as they were when they were in their early twenties. He
 said that as these groups of more educated young people replaced the older
 generation, Britain would become an ever more relaxed place. 
 
 Soft drugs have also grown in widespread acceptability, with more than half
 the country wanting cannabis to be legalised, compared with a third seven
 years ago. That is probably because the use of cannabis is now so widespread,
 with a quarter of those surveyed saying that they had tried it. 
 
 A third of Labour voters, twice as many as Conservatives, had tried the drug,
 and being young, living in London and having a degree also increased the
 chances. 
 
 One issue that bucks the trend is hard drugs. Most take a strong position on
 heroin that has got stronger over the past seven years. Now the proportion of
 people who believe that heroin dealers should always be prosecuted has crept
 up to 97 per cent. 
 
 Â“The views on heroin show that Britain is by no means becoming a liberal
 free-for-all,Â” Alison Park, co-director of the study, said. Â“People are making
 quite a clear distinction between what they think (of) as right and wrong.Â” 
 
 On other matters, the survey indicates that almost half those questioned think
 that most of the social security budget goes on unemployment benefits Â— in
 fact, they account for 6 per cent; that union membership has fallen by a fifth
 in the past 18 years, with just under a third of workers in a union; and that
 half those questioned oppose secondary school selection. In 1984 the figure
 was 40 per cent. 
 
 The survey also indicates that 19 per cent of men aged between 25 and 34 live
 with their parents, twice as many as women.

"I use exmh 2.5 with procmail for presorting incoming mail and move it to
the relevant folder using rcvstore.Recently, my incoming mail (or spool) location moved to another disk.
I'm not quite clear how to reconfigure procmail/rcvstore/exmh to accept
mail from the new location.There seems to be a variable in exmh-defaults (bgspool). It says at the
top of the file not to edit these lines. So, I went ahead and edited it :-)
That does not make a difference.It seems like procmail is the one that is actually reading the mail from
my spool/incoming mail area and piping it to rcvstore. So, I need to
configure that probably.Any idea how I would do this?Thanks

Cable companies cracking down on Wi-FiBroadband providers are cracking down on popular Wi-Fi networks, threatening to cut service to customers who set up the inexpensive wireless systems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access.
Time Warner Cable of New York City has given 10 customers less than a week to stop using their accounts to provide a wireless local area network available to anyone within 300 feet. The letters are just an initial volley; Time Warner expects to send additional letters, while AT&T Broadband also is preparing similar letters for some of its customers.

Last week, tex9, a small software-development company in San Francisco, began beta testing an iPod plug-in for its xtunes music player software, which is itself a Linux clone of Apple's iTunes. The plug-in will, tex9 promises, allow drag-and-drop access to iPod, which holds up to 10GB of music.

from implementation of any project that involved tree removal.  These

"re : uk gas late deal input and deal booking errors - ol . 1 m hit sorry to hear about this one . i have some observations to make from my reading ( and re - reading ) of the account : 1 it looks like the old "" undue influence "" problem again . it seems some attempts were made by operations to follow up , but nothing happened . we tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we don ' t have any way to protect them if they do - there is still the fear that if they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career . and that is because twice a year , at the prc , that can happen . this incident shows some of these attributes . for the operations process to be effective there has to be ( and be seen to be ) little significant influence from commercial groups over the ranking of the operations staff . 2 whoever signed off the new deal lists in the dpr should be asked to confirm the basis on which they signed it . 3 why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers ? brokerage is in the p & l and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage is at the agreed rate , they should simply pay the brokerage . 4 two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable - it should be done same day . i would not have waited for the traders to do it , but i would want to know why it took them so long . 5 given that these ( short ) trades were absent from the portfolio during a highly volatile period of rising prices , i would wonder about motivation in addressing the position during this time . essentially , if it had been correct we would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we did . i would pursue explanations to points 2 , 4 and 5 . dp fernley dyson @ ect 06 / 12 / 2000 02 : 41 am to : james new / lon / ect @ ect cc : richard lewis / lon / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , robert yeo / lon / ect @ ect , gail hill / lon / ect @ ect , ian sloman / lon / ect @ ect , steve w young / lon / ect @ ect , david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron , brent a price / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : uk gas late deal input and deal booking errors - ol . 1 m hit james , thanks for the note . as described , this is an intolerable situation . i agree your action points , but we need timelines and quantitative measures of compliance / improvement - please could you provide a weekly update on this area specifically and until we are satisfied that things are as they should be . on a more general note - let ' s ensure that the ' global standards ' address the lapses in timely action / follow - up identified here so that we can monitor performance across the business . fernley james new 09 / 06 / 2000 10 : 03 to : richard lewis / lon / ect @ ect , fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect cc : robert yeo / lon / ect @ ect , gail hill / lon / ect @ ect , ian sloman / lon / ect @ ect subject : uk gas late deal input and deal booking errors - ol . 1 m hit on the 7 th of june gas risk management became aware that two ' late ' trades had been entered into the gas trader ' s ' blue book ' which were both being booked significantly late and had a material negative p & l impact ( negative ol . 1 m ) . the ' late ' deals were done on the 3 rd of february ( marcello romano ) and the 30 th of march ( haakon olafson ) and were both forward starting sells for periods in 2003 - 2004 . background 1 ) input errors for some considerable time we have been concerned with the number of deal input errors that have been occurring in the gas area with the most significant number coming form the uk gas traders . numerous errors have been found by documentation and risk management over the accuracy and timeliness of entering deals into the ' blue book ' ( the gas traders are currently the only traders in europe who do not enter their own trades into the valuation system - there is currently a big push to change this which has the support of john sherriff with a deadline date of 31 july ) . in the past documentation and gas risk management have repeatedly highlighted booking errors to the gas traders but the error rate has not fallen . a log of all deal input errors has been formally maintained since the beginning of may which highlights an error rate of 12 % - 15 % of non eol trades . this has been discussed with richard lewis and corrective action is expected . 2 ) deal booking and reconciliation process ( non eol trades ) deals are initially written into the ' blue book ' by the gas traders when the deal is done . this book is photocopied several times a day and the deals are the manually input into gasdesk by documentation on the same day . faxed broker statements are received ( usually ) by documentation the next day and these are reconciled to gasdesk with errors and amendments made by documentation liasing with the traders as necessary . at this time brokers were faxing one statement per trade ( relevant later ) . 3 ) new deal sign off as part of the daily dpr process a separate new deal sheet is prepared and is signed off by the traders to formally agree the new deals done on the day and the implied origination p invoice received before 15 march as settlements started checking it . ( keren perrott - settlements started on 13 march ) discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 may ( chris ware to emma thomson ) traders contacted on 24 may after copy of broker confirm was sent on 22 may as requested by documentation to prove deal . deal entered 6 june after traders checked the tapes . ieb broker - np trade on 30 mar 2000 trader haakon ieb invoice date 6 april ; invoice received before 27 april as settlements started checking it . ( keren perrott ) discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 may ( chris ware to robert vaughn ) traders contacted on 24 may after copy of broker confirm was requested . deal entered 6 june after traders checked the tapes . who was at fault and where did the control break down ? i do not feel it is constructive to try to attach blame for what happened but there are lessons to be learned and general observations and conclusions that can be made and drawn . firstly there are major concerns over the gas trader ' s accuracy and prioritisation of booking trades . despite numerous conversations on the subject very little improvement has been seen . it has now got to the stage where documentation are formally recording all errors including what the error was and who made it . this is now being communicated to richard lewis every two weeks with the aim being not only to reduce the amount of time trade support spend correcting errors and re running dprs but also to try to avoid the incidence of errors such as this . the current error rate is 12 % - 15 % of non eol trades . documentation currently estimate that in 9 times out of 10 the broker or counterparty are correct . secondly around a month ago we contacted brokers and asked for them to provide us with one statement per day rather than one per deal which will eliminate any lost statements or missed deals as it will be immediately obvious when a statement from a broker has not arrived . most brokers have now changed but one or two still send one statement per trade . reconciliation ' s of these daily statements to gasdesk are evidenced . thirdly it has been impressed on both documentation and settlements to follow up more vigorously ( and by mail ) errors and omissions on a more timely basis . there is however a backlog or broker invoices which have have been checked by settlements but have nto been checked or approved by the traders . this is causing concern at the brokers who are chasing payment . action points trading traders to input their own deals directly into gasdesk traders to improve their accuracy of deal booking traders to approve invoices on a more timely basis trade support settlements to clear backlog of broker invoices documentation to chase brokers to send daily deal statements not individual deal statements all follow ups to be evidenced with mails used as appropriate documentation to check all trades since the beginning of the year versus the broker records documentation to perform a reconciliation with all counterparties to agree our forward position from july 2000 to september 2006 ( the traded part of the curve )",Safe Email

"re : rto week - - summary of day two morning panel rto week day 3 - - october 17 , 2001 standardizing rto tariffs the morning panel focused on which transmission services should be standardized in rto tariffs across an interconnection or the entire country . there were many diverse views on the panel , and the staff and commissioners were somewhat more engaged in this session . the panelists were : ricky bittle , arkansas electric coop ; jim caldwell , american wind ; peter esposito , dynegy ; rory mcminn , new mexico psc ; glenn ross , dominion resources ; audrey zibelman , xcel energy . general observations this panel had a lot less agreement than the previous panels . dynegy opposes standardization of a transmission tariff and urges ferc to give strong guidance to stakeholders and then let the stakeholders work out the details of a new tariff . dominion advocates a more prescriptive approach by ferc , noting that stakeholders have been unable to reach agreement over the last five years . excel has it ' s own focus - they want to be an itc and want to provide many of the rto services without being an rto . the wind group is mostly concerned about the ability to provide generation on an "" as available "" basis . the commissioner from new mexico does not want standardization , does not want ferc stepping on the state ' s jurisdictional toes , and does not want new mexico ratepayers ' rates to go up . arkansas electric coop insists that spp transmission capacity is full , so if competitors want to move power through spp , new transmission must first be built . i am somewhat concerned that some of the commissioners may believe that tariff standardization is not necessary . while the dynegy concept had merit at one time , it may be too late to rely on the stakeholder process to resolve issues , and it could take many months to go through the process , only to have ferc , in the end , decide the details anyway . we may want to submit comments on this issue to ferc at the conclusion of rto week . what services should be standardized ? overall , dynegy opposes standardizing tariffs but believes certain aspects of reservations should be standardized - - timing , confirmation processing , maintenance issues , bus names , ramping protocols , assumptions for atc calculations , posting times , bumping rules , and settlement time . with regard to congestion management , it should not be standardized between rtos . xcel does not support a standardized tariff but urges ferc to standardize some issues such as cbm calculations , reserve obligations and load balancing and penalties . american wind says ferc must focus on having liquid spot markets in rtos and not worry about tariff standardization . dominion cautions ferc about dynegy ' s proposal to let the industry work out the details . he says this is what happened with order no . 2000 and the industry was unable to work it out . should ferc retain cbm ? ricky ( arkansas coop ) believes that the bigger the rto , the less important cbm is because the rto will have enough resources internally to effectuate reserve sharing . dynegy thinks cbm should be eliminated . dominion thinks cbm should be retained but the rules need to be changed . cbm should not be set for a year - it changes on a daily basis and this should be reflected . nor should cbm be standardized because needs vary region to region . however , because cbm is used for load , the cost of cbm should be allocated to load . all panelists agreed with the concept that if cbm is retained , load should be required to purchase it as a service provided under the tariff . network versus point to point service peter ( dynegy ) discussed the need to develop a new type of transmission service that combines the best features from network and point to point , similar to transportation service offered in gas - - firm and interruptible . peter suggests starting with the crt tariff proposed several years ago . glenn ( dominion ) thinks the crt is outdated and thinks we need a new type of service but agrees that it should combine the best elements of network and point to point . should all transmission service be under the rto ' s tariff ? most of the panelists said yes , all service should be under the tariff , but ricky bittle said there needs to be a transition period - minimum of 5 years , no more than 10 years . commissioner mcminn said no - he sees this as an infringement on the states ' jurisdiction . what services need to be changed under a new rto tariff ? jim ( wind ) believes that the imbalance provisions must be revised so as not to penalize "" as available "" resources . ricky thinks transmission expansion is the most important issue to address in a new tariff . xcel urges ferc to recognize the distinction between rtos and itcs and allow itcs to design and offer their own transmission tariffs . ray alvarez will circulate a summary of the afternoon panel on cost allocation . please let me know if you have any questions . sarah",Safe Email

"var david , during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations . mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system : we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves . we have agreed on the following : 1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run . 2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates . 3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions . this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ; cooperation of trading and rac will be critical . vince",Safe Email

Thu Aug 29,10:19 AM ET
By Andrew MarshallBANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand
looking for a wife. It took two hours to find her.""The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all
my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""I
knew then there was something special.""Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet
-- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,
who is expecting their first child.Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women
in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that
often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand
in search of a wife.""I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan,"" he said. ""I knew I
found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.""Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in
touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and
the couple married.MR. MARRIAGELawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency
Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself ""Mr. Marriage,""
started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction
agency.Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.""In the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""To the best of my
knowledge, they have all been successful.""Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that
require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.
Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women
looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's
office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and
language problems.""We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,""
Lynch said. ""But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.""After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know
each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every
client has found a potential wife.""At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and
think he hasn't made his mind up,"" he said. In most cases, marriage follows,
usually within the next year.Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a
Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less
than 10 percent have broken up.Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just
arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.""Sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""And sometimes they are very
impatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calm
down, OK, we'll talk.""'But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife
and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives
for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic
stress disorder.WHY?Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics
say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to
form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of
impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is
no reason to object. ""If you talk about people who are needy, I think
everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I
need Wan,"" he said.""Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no
secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem
with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to
their future husband.""Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they
choose to use his agency.His brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of de-feminized,
over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British
singles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are
not ""God's gift to women.""Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their
own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.""They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques
or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?
Impossible,"" she said.""Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are
good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from
ladies from other countries.""Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,
the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also
not a major obstacle.""Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having
a husband who is significantly older,"" Lynch said. ""When I met my wife she
couldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic
dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up
very quickly.""Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move
to the West.""We have kitchens, we have study classes,"" Roongthip said. ""We teach them
how to eat, and when to make tea.""PITFALLSBut not all dreams come true. ""Bee"" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to
Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is
back in Bangkok, sad and angry.""He had no friends, and I was so lonely,"" she said. ""I tried to make him
happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never
spoke to me.""Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. ""I thought I would be happy
there,"" she said. ""But it was the worst time of my life.""Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure
unsuitable candidates are weeded out.""We are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""We will not take on all
comers.""Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the
arrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company,
looking for a foreign husband.""Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,""
Moylan said. ""But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.""",Safe Email

( and as a final parting shot , so to speak , i would like to point out that in english writing we use a capital letter for the 1st . p . s . in all environments , but not for any other person ! why ? was this a printing influence too ( e . g . , to distinguish it from small "" i "" in roman numerals ? ) . ) from talking to a local professor , russian , for instance , ( if i remember correctly ) , does not have this distinction . how about other language writing systems , european or not ? and what effect does this english pattern have on us psychologically ? in the sense that "" i "" is more important than "" you , them "" etc . ? ) . once again , thank-you to all respondents . i look forward to discussion , if any , on my questions - - either post to list or to me directly . regards to all , anthea . * * "" words do n't mean , people mean . . . .

really have no idea what they claim they've patented - doin DCT

compression algorithm the project comes up with (fingers
crossed). And I wouldn't worry about the jpeg thing - in addition
the patent runs out next year, and I would suggest that having
failed to protect their IP for 15 years, as (iirc) is their
responsibility, their claim would probably never hold up in
court.Cheers,

' ' enron troubles hit houston office market ; tower project delayed 2001 - 11 - 29 12 : 25 ( new york ) enron troubles hit houston office market ; tower project delayed houston , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - trammell crow co . delayed construction of a $ 108 million office development in downtown houston , the first real estate project in the city to suffer the fallout from enron ' s financial troubles . trammell crow delayed groundbreaking on the planned 34 - story tower until at least next year , said leah rogers , a trammell crow spokeswoman . construction was to have started next week . ` ` given the national economic uncertainty and the uncertainty associated with the future availability of class ` a ' space springing from the recent events at enron , we have decided to delay our construction start until future visibility improves , ' ' matt khourie , who heads trammell crow ' s houston development operations , said in a statement . enron , the largest u . s . energy trader , may have to file for bankruptcy protection and liquidate assets after dynegy inc . abandoned its proposed purchase of the company , investors and analysts said . with enron expected to give most of the 3 million square feet it occupies in houston , developers will have a harder time filling projects , forcing rental rates down , brokers said . about 2 million square feet of enron ' s space is in the city ' s downtown , where trammell crow ' s ballpark place project was planned . the project was to include apartments and retail space , and sit next to enron field , home to the major league baseball team houston astros , according to the houston chronicle , which reported the delay earlier . houston has 4 projects under construction , including a 40 - story , 1 . 17 - million - square - foot tower being built by enron next to its current headquarters . the projects are mainly being built for power companies , said peyton collins , head of property broker insignia / esg ' s houston office . ` ` the downtown market is 5 percent vacant and if you look five years out , with all the space that ' s coming in line , vacancy rates could double , ' ' said collins . other houston office projects underway include an 800 , 000 - square - foot building in which reliant resources will lease 550 , 000 square feet , and a 600 , 000 - square - foot tower , half of which will be occupied by calpine corp . , according to insignia . newpower has enough cash to run through 2 nd quarter ( updatel ) 2001 - 11 - 29 12 : 36 ( new york ) newpower has enough cash to run through 2 nd quarter ( updatel ) ( updates with financing details in second paragraph and enron ' s third - quarter loss on investments in sixth paragraph . ) purchase , new york , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - newpower holdings inc . , a venture formed by enron corp . to compete with traditional natural - gas and electric utilities , said it has enough cash and credit to run through the second quarter . the company is negotiating with lenders for $ 50 million for next year and another $ 50 million in 2003 , spokeswoman gael doar said . newpower , 44 percent owned by enron , may need money to buy gas for winter inventories next year , she said . newpower said a possible enron bankruptcy filing probably won ' t affect its earnings . the purchase , new york - based company said it can meet its credit obligations to enron and utilities and will continue to deliver to customers . newpower had 805 , 000 customers at the end of the third quarter and said it expects to have 840 , 000 to 860 , 000 by the end of the year . most electricity customers are in texas . georgia is its largest gas market , doar said . it also has business in ohio , pennsylvania and elsewhere . dynegy inc . yesterday abandoned its bid for rival enron , once the biggest energy trader , after standard i ' m sure i can expect some of that sort of stuff but nothing yet today . i ' m sure they ' ve got other things to think about . ' ' nymex tells members enron trades must be approved ( updatel ) 2001 - 11 - 29 12 : 47 ( new york ) nymex tells members enron trades must be approved ( updatel ) ( adds margin increases in fourth - fifth paragraphs . ) new york , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - new york mercantile exchange president j . robert collins told floor members they could not accept orders from enron corp . unless they receive written authorization from an exchange clearing member . a fax from collins to member firms today said the order was effective immediately and that it would ` ` remain in effect until further notice from the exchange . ' ' clearing members are companies that guarantee transactions on the exchange , which trades energy and metals futures and options . the exchange yesterday said it will raise margins on its natural gas and crude oil futures contracts at the close of trading today . margins are deposits traders must make with the exchange when buying or selling futures contracts to ensure obligations will be met . while the exchange gave no reason for the increase , the decision followed a day of wide changes in natural gas prices . the swings began after dynegy inc . abandoned plans to purchase enron , once the biggest gas trader . traders grew concerned that enron might be forced into bankruptcy . enron metals close to finding a buyer , administrators say 2001 - 11 - 29 13 : 32 ( new york ) enron metals close to finding a buyer , administrators say london , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s metals unit , one of the biggest traders on the london metal exchange , is close to being sold , its administrator said , an accord that would end an 18 - month foray into markets for copper and similar products . possible buyers include hsbc holdings plc , glencore international ag and the current management of the company , traders and analysts speculated . officials at the companies couldn ' t immediately be reached for comment . ` ` there is already very serious interest in enron ' s metal business , and negotiations are expected to lead to a successful deal ' ' soon , said tony lomas , a pricewaterhousecoopers administrator for enron in europe . ` ` our primary focus will be on the large physical assets and trading position of the group . ' ' traders and analysts have speculated that enron metals would be sold since dynegy inc . agreed earlier this month to buy enron corp . for $ 23 billion . after that accord collapsed yesterday , the metals unit seemed slated for a sale , analysts said . enron agreed to buy the business , formerly mg plc , for $ 445 million in may of last year . mg itself was the metals - trading unit of germany ' s metallgesellschaft ag and a century - old operation upon which that german construction , engineering and trading company was built . it is one of just 11 floor traders on the london metal exchange , the world ' s biggest metals bourse . enron earned commissions though brokering trades there , charged rent at its warehouses owned by henry bath & son ltd . and speculated on the direction of metals prices . declining market the former chief executive of metallgesellschaft , heinz schimmelbusch , in an interview earlier this month denied speculation that his pennsylvania - based safeguard international fund lp was interested in buying enron or any metals - trading operation . hsbc , europe ' s biggest bank by market value , said last month it ' s considering a plan to add trading of industrial metals such as copper and aluminum to its precious - metals trading operation to meet demand from its customers . any interest from glencore may stem from its desire to expand its existing operations , said mike price , head of mining and metals at societe generale , which is itself a so - called ring dealer , or floor trader , on the lme . whoever buys enron metals ` ` has to be somebody pretty substantial , ' ' price said . if the current management hopes to be the buyer , ` ` they would need to find somebody with deep pockets . ' ' the new owner of enron metals will be entering the metals market at a time when copper prices have declined 15 percent this year and aluminum prices are 7 percent down as demand dropped from users such as aircraft makers and electronics companies amid slowing economies . the declining prices have led n . m . rothschild & sons , a member of the lme , to quit base metals trading and prompted scotiamoccata , a metals - trading unit of canada ' s bank of nova scotia to leave the lme ring . the departure of scotiamoccata reduced the number of ring dealers to 11 and raised doubts about the future of open - outcry trading at the exchange . the lme is promoting less - expensive electronic trading . german bank enron exposure between $ 9 million and $ 100 million 2001 - 11 - 29 13 : 32 ( new york ) german bank enron exposure between $ 9 million and $ 100 million frankfurt , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - dresdner bank ag , which is owned by allianz ag , said its exposure to enron corp . is about $ 100 million . deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag said their exposure to enron amounts to a ` ` double - digit ' ' million euros amount . europe ' s largest bank has an exposure ` ` significantly ' ' below 100 million euros ( $ 89 million ) , said ronald weichert , a spokesman for deutsche bank . commerzbank ' s exposure is more than 10 million euros and less than 50 million euros , spokesman peter pietsch said . dresdner expects ` ` way less ' ' than $ 100 million to default , and will take the appropriate loan loss reserves at the end of the year , said spokeswoman elke pawellek . the largest u . s . energy trader , may file for bankruptcy protection after dynegy inc . yesterday abandoned its proposed merger with enron , forcing enron to liquidate assets to pay some of its $ 15 billion in publicly held debt . enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy case 2001 - 11 - 29 14 : 04 ( new york ) enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy case washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . is poised to file the largest bankruptcy reorganization in history after dynegy inc . scuttled plans to acquire the energy trader that is saddled with more than $ 15 billion in debt . enron , with less than $ 2 billion in cash as of last week , must pay $ 690 million to lenders by mid - december and is responsible for another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt owed by affiliated partnerships . the houston - based company ' s collapse was underscored by new restrictions on its operations . the new york mercantile exchange barred floor members from accepting orders from enron without special written authorization , and the company ' s internet trading was reduced from about 30 commodities to three products . a bankruptcy filing by enron would top texaco inc . ' s record $ 35 . 9 billion case in 1987 , with creditors lining up to claim what ' s left of the company ' s more than $ 61 billion in assets . ` ` it ' s a black hole , ' ' said gary hindes , managing director of deltec asset management llc , which has no investment in enron . ` ` until the forensic accountants can get in there and sort things out , you just don ' t know what enron ' s worth . ' ' duke energy corp . , j . p . morgan chase & co . , williams cos . and a dozen other companies say they may lose more than $ 1 billion combined from enron ' s collapse . electricity and natural gas companies said enron owed them almost $ 600 million as of yesterday . in london , was appointed administrator of enron ' s european holding company and some of its operating companies , a step other companies have taken before filing chapter 11 papers in the u . s . enron shares have lost more than $ 26 billion in market value in the last six months . lawyers enron has hired the law firm weil gotshal & manges llp , which has the nation ' s largest bankruptcy practice , and the blackstone group lp investment banking firm . arthur newman , head of restructuring at blackstone , said his firm was retained but declined to comment further . chapter 11 would let enron officials continue to control the company while negotiating a recovery plan with creditors . a provision of u . s . bankruptcy law automatically blocks debt - collection efforts , lawsuits and other actions against the company . ` ` a chapter 11 filing can be a great thing for a cash - starved company being attacked from all sides , ' ' said nancy rapoport , dean of the university of houston law center . thousands affected an enron bankruptcy would affect thousands of people , including the company ' s 21 , 000 employees , its customers , suppliers , investors and other creditors . the court - supervised recovery process would give enron a chance to change strategies and fix mistakes . it might take years to complete and may end in the company ' s liquidation . in addition to its energy trading operation , enron operates a nationwide gas pipeline system spanning 25 , 000 miles . it also owns portland general electric , which generates and distributes power to about 725 , 000 customers in the pacific northwest . the company ' s enron broadband services is building a global fiber - optic communications network . chapter 11 reorganization lets companies abandon onerous contracts and unprofitable leases . ` ` every bad business deal enron got into they ' ll walk away from , ' ' said peter chapman , a distressed - debt investor who also publishes newsletters on high - profile bankruptcy reorganizations . recovery the goal in chapter 11 is a recovery plan that allows a company to pay creditors and come out of bankruptcy . a plan typically must be approved by a majority of creditors representing two - thirds of a company ' s debts . then a company would ask a bankruptcy judge for final approval . the recovery plan divides a company ' s value among various classes of creditors . under a hierarchy set by the u . s . bankruptcy code , secured creditors - - those with collateral backing their claims - - are paid ahead of unsecured creditors , such as bondholders and suppliers . financial advisers to creditors and companies in large bankruptcies say a chapter 11 recovery plan for enron would be particularly difficult to produce . ` ` you have a host of intangible assets combined with a morass of contingent liabilities creating a potential witches ' brew of a bankruptcy , ' ' said jeff werbalowsky of houlihan lokey howard & zukin , an investment banking firm that has been contacted for advice by enron bondholders . shareholders enron ' s shareholders are likely to lose all of their investment in a chapter 11 case because they would be last in line to get paid . enron shares fell 20 cents , or 33 percent , to 41 cents in afternoon trading . the shares traded at $ 54 . 54 on june 4 . the company said this morning it was evaluating whether it will pay a scheduled 12 . 5 - cent quarterly dividend on dec . 20 . enron ' s bond prices reflect the uncertainty about the company ' s value . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent notes that mature in 2006 were unchanged at about 22 cents on the dollar , traders said . at that price the notes yield 53 percent . some recovery for enron creditors in a bankruptcy case may come from lawsuits , said russell a . belinsky , an investment banker with chanin capital partners , which also has been approached for advice by enron bondholders . ` ` there ' s a lot of juicy legal issues , ' ' said belinsky . potential targets include enron ' s accounting firm and its officers and directors . ` ` disentangling all the pieces in a reorganization is going to be a painstaking job , ' ' he said . liability dynegy might face some liability for canceling its purchase of enron . dynegy invoked terms of the buyout agreement that gave it the right to purchase an enron natural gas pipeline if the takeover fell apart . dynegy received the right to the pipeline in exchange for a $ 1 . 5 billion investment in enron by chevrontexaco corp . , which owns one - fourth of dynegy . enron might use bankruptcy to prevent dynegy from walking away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the pipeline . the dynegy acquisition , valued at $ 23 billion when it was proposed on nov . 9 , collapsed as bankers failed to raise the $ 1 . 5 billion enron needed to operate until the deal was completed . the lack of funds and a credit downgrade contributed to dynegy ' s decision . bankers led by j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james b . lee tried for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed . investors turned them down because of heightened concern enron wouldn ' t be able to pay its debts . three credit -

"Hi all...I'm new to SpamAssasin so I appologies if the question has been asked
before.
I'm thinking of setting up SA with my Qmail(Maildir) server acting as our
gateway.
It currently provides inline virus scanning and ORDB open relay filtering.
Is it possible to setup SA to act as a sitewide Spam filter ?
Is there any documentation on setting this up ?
The Qmail server does not house any local mail accounts, it acts as a pure
relay for our internal mail server, I am currently relaing mail for 8
internal domains...Suggestions would be appreciated.Regards

between creditors, management, and shareholders
over control of assets. Because a corporation is
incorporeal (hee, hee), it can't be much else.If you're concerned about the imbalance of power
related to corporations, I think the more relevant
areas are tax structures, especially the income
tax, various forms of externality, law related to
employment, corporate transparency, and corporate

( e . g . a 20 m / d package might involve a day bidding process , a 100 m / d block may involve a week posting ) . demonstrate that puts / calls don ' t undercut the release market . explain that release is used for day to day decisions , while we believe options will serve to help shippers with longer term strategic decision . be specific about any waivers of the part 284 regulations . work on the definition of the 4 options types . they stumbled over some of the wording , like the use of phrase "" recall "" in the transporter call . detailed notes we had a surprisingly positive reception from rates west . this could be due in part to mike coleman ' s reputed continued interest on the electric side and his self - proclaimed corporate bent . he did say that he understands the underlying business drivers for this program and suggested that a flushed out narrative with the filing to explain these would help our efforts . he said that the timing on this type of offering is good now , as the chairman is pressuring staff to improve the marketplace ( the california situation again ) . both groups suggested that we needed to lay out as much detail as possible in the filing , including examples of each type of options . as mike delineated and we expected , the major issues that may cause discomfort are affiliate abuse and capacity hoarding ( cornering the market under a long - term option ) or speculative capacity holding . to defend the service , we should lay out the impacts and explain why this offers an improvement over our present situation ( discounted firm ) . some specific questions from the rates group included : how does this impact capacity release how does tw protect against hoarding why aren ' t all options considered negotiated rates . are options tradable alone ( without capacity ) would the availability of options change the volume of capacity held by ena how are rofrs affected some specific questions from the policy group included : what are discriminating parameters / business decisions in allocating capacity how are competing offers allocated when in excess of available capacity how are options posted , bid on ? what are parameters of the options , specify range is it in the contract is this a physical or financial product does this verge into negotiated t & c territory ? is this like koch ' s option proposal ?

"hill stimulus bill update : 10 / 16 / 01 us treasury sec ' y o ' neill has been out in front this week as an administration voice trying to shape the parameters of the hill debates ( trying to keep the lid on some proposals that could have long - term costs for the budgets several years out ) . it will continue to be a delicate balance , as the administration is looking to get a final bill by the end of next week and get money into pockets in time for the end of the year . fed chair greenspan could also critically affect the debate tomorrow in testimony before the joint economic committee : his core belief is that whatever the precise stimulus number arrived at , it should be primarily temporary in character . his preference under current conditions is for security and fiscal policy to be the response instruments in the face of the diminishing returns to and efficacy of further rate reductions in the face of uncertainty . competitive analysis will continue to follow this issue closely and welcomes feedback and further specific questions on the issues below . please contact brendan fitzsimmons at x 5 - 4763 with further questions . enron global markets competitive analysis hill stimulus bill update : 10 / 16 / 01 partisanship is the question for senate battle : final stimulus bill likely in the $ 80 - 110 b range , but hill dems ' and repubs ' aims could push it northward summary senate numbers look set to exceed bush figures ( $ 60 - 75 b ) , may approach house ways and means $ 100 b ; final conferenced bill could hit $ 140 b ; all on this on top of the special $ 55 b approved right after the attacks for airlines and immediate impact areas republican plan , so far , all tax cuts and no spending democratic plan has a lot more spending , but it is all on supporting people who have lost their jobs and none of it is on infrastructure final , conferenced bill may run as high as $ 140 b if the ' neglected ' middle - class is given another rebate check ( up to another $ 38 b ) one major question hanging over size , composition and speed of the senate package is whether senate maj . leader daschle decides to move quickly toward a bipartisan senate package that tries to isolate the house republicans and their business tax cutting agenda daschle will present dilemma to president bush and his senior advisers . "" we will tell the president that we need assurance from the white house that compromises we make will be supported by the white house . if bush can ' t give that assurance - unable to control the right - then we will probably opt for the more partisan position . "" report the centrifugal pull of a big number like $ 100 b proved the main attractor in early action on the stimulus front . house ways and means committee votes approved a tax cut package - mainly for businesses - that added up to just about exactly that number . the senate will produce something a little smaller , but the handwriting is on the wall as the two houses of congress move toward a conference committee package that could easily top that total . one key member of the senate negotiations told sources late sunday : "" we are working on a package designed to stay with the principle that everything should be temporary and roll off after one year to avoid blowing through budget surpluses later . right now we are still aiming to stay in bush ' s $ 60 b to $ 75 b bracket , but everyone knows the final number will go up from there . "" although senate process is controlled by democrats , senate finance committee chairman baucus ( dem ) is in a highly contested re - election campaign next year in a deeply republican state . just as he did with the earlier bush tax cut plan , you can expect him to reach out to work with senior republicans ( such as grassley ) despite the wishes of more partisan members of the leadership . likely elements of the democratic senate package : rebates for those who pay payroll taxes but did not get the first $ 300 or $ 600 rebate . this was also in the house republican package . temporary investment incentive for businesses - this could easily be 30 % - but they will keep it to one year . some form of extending the loss - carryback for businesses and allowing one - year use of amt credits in 2002 . the loss - carryback is quite likely because of the relatively small 10 - year costs . for democrats amt is more complicated . ( see below ) some form of expanded unemployment insurance incentive - not just extending the number of weeks , but other elements to expand who is eligible . 50 % rebate for unemployed workers who pay for extended health care benefits through the cobra program . partisanship question : there are a series of senior democrats who argue that an early compromise could be a major mistake since house republicans will simply "" pocket the concessions we make toward republican - style tax cutting and press on with their business tax cutting agenda during the conference committee . "" in other words , does daschle position the senate democrats for the bipartisan high road after this bill is passed or does he position democrats for the partisan wrangling that seems very likely all the way to conference committee later this month . looking forward to the final , conferenced bill : sorting through various proposals , sources suggest a possible solution agenda : rebate for bottom 34 million payroll taxpayers 30 % expensing for 12 months ( maybe compromise of 18 months ) five year net - loss carry back unemployment insurance extension and some expansion - - maybe through help directly to states ( more rep . governors may like that ) and some cobra assistance . repeal of corporate amt ( or several - year suspension ) as concessions to house republicans ( dems go along but say it will be a big mistake ) odds and ends from appropriators ( energy assistance , food assistance , etc ) all of this comes to around $ 100 billion . although the numbers have gravitated steadily northward , there is one major decision to be made that could add another $ 40 billion to the total ( bringing the final stimulus package to something like $ 120 - $ 140 b ) : more rebate checks both house and senate agree there should be a rebate for those workers who did not get the earlier rebate because they did not earn enough to pay income taxes ( that ' s the bottom 34 million ) . but it would be highly unlike this - or any - congress to pass stimulus legislation that helped the bottom 20 % and the top 2 % ( through major business tax cuts ) , but left the 75 % in the middle out of the equation entirely . one solution could be to send another rebate to everyone : another $ 38 b",Safe Email

===============================Thousands spent on strippers, golf memberships
shows Pentagon spending is out of control, Libertarians sayWASHINGTON, DC -- Quiz question: Which of the following items have been 
charged to the taxpayers recently by military personnel wielding 
government-issued credit cards?(a) $38,000 for lap dancing at strip clubs near military bases.(b) $3,400 for a Sumo wrestling suit and $9,800 for Halloween costumes.(c) $7,373 for closing costs on a home and $16,000 for a corporate golf 
membership.(d) $4,600 for white beach sand and $19,000 worth of decorative ""river 
rock"" at a military base in the Arabian desert.(e) all of the above.""Incredibly, the answer is 'all of the above,' said Steve Dasbach, 
Libertarian Party executive director. ""Thanks to the federal 
government's policy of doling out credit cards with no questions asked, 
the military has launched a raid on your wallet.""The shocking revelations are contained in a General Accounting Office 
audit released last week that uncovered $101 million in ""seemingly 
unneeded expenditures"" made by the Air Force and Army in 2000 and 
2001. The purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax 
credit card policy: At least 1.4 million Defense Department employees 
carry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1 
billion in goods and services, the audit found.In one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military IDs and 
government-issued travel cards to get cash at adult-entertainment bars, 
then spent the money there. The clubs charged a 10 percent fee to 
supply the soldiers with cash -- then billed the full amount to their 
travel cards as a restaurant charge, the GAO found.""Are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a 
strip club, or defending our country while wearing a Sumo wrestling 
suit?"" asked Dasbach. ""Americans who support a bigger defense budget, 
take note: The Pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated, 
reckless government agency. It promises your money will be spent on the 
worthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even 
imagine.""Other spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury 
cruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and 
armchair at a military installation in the Middle East, Dasbach noted.
 
Some military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit 
noted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can 
be ""a useful tool for building good relations with a host country"" 
such as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates. Not surprisingly, Dasbach said, the audit found ""little evidence of 
documented disciplinary action"" against those who misused the cards, 
so taxpayers may end up paying the tab.
  
""It's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat 
Defense Department workers, and force them to personally reimburse 
taxpayers for every penny of improper spending,"" he said.
 
""Then cut the Pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard 
against such wasteful spending in the future. Perhaps that's one way to 
force the Pentagon to spend its resources defending the country, 
instead of offending the taxpayer.""

likely that an application that wrote an internal ""copy"" command would
also have their own customized ""paste"" command, to make sure the two
work together.)  Whether the internal (custom) select and paste
functions interoperate with the X server's global select and paste
functions will vary from program to program, because in each case you
are relying on the program's authors' efforts to blend separate systems.

"review : scobbie : autosegmental representation scobbie , james m . ( 1997 ) autosegmental representation in a declarative constraint - based framework , garland press , new york . [ revision of 1991 phd dissertation , university of edinburgh ] [ * ] michael hammond university of arizona jim scobbie 's dissertation , recently published in the outstanding dissertations in linguistics series through garland press , is an excellent example of a pre - optimality - theory attempt at a constraint-based phonology that has received insufficient attention in the phonological community . this is extremely unfortunate , as the thesis makes a number of interesting proposals that are well worth considering today . the dissertation is not in the usual vein of american phonology theses . it 's not an in-depth analysis of some particular array of data . rather , it appears to fit a much more european template , with more attention paid to placing the author 's proposal in the context of previous ideas . despite this very different approach , there is much to recommend it . the general hypothesis pursued is that phonological generalizations and representations are best cast as attribute-value structures . these formal devices are drawn from the hpsg ( head - driven phrase - structure grammar ) literature ( pollard & sag , 1987 ) . the basic idea is that dominance is expressed as something roughly equivalent to a featural distinction . for example , in a standard phonological representation the fact that a vowel might be high is expressed by assigning the vowel a ' + ' for a feature [ high ] , e . g . [ + high ] . expressed in attribute-value formalism , the attribute [ high ] has the value ' + ' . hpsg goes one step further and encodes dominance in the same fashion . thus , the fact that a syllable has a [ + high ] nucleus is expressed by positing a nucleus attribute for a syllable element and then allowing the nucleus attribute to itself have [ + high ] as an attribute-value pair . ( 1 ) the formal object above denotes a syllable with a [ + high ] nucleus . ( i ' ve indicated irrelevant information with ellipses . ) in the context of these representations , scobbie 's central claim is that autosegmental association can be formalized as dominance in an attribute-value structure . phonological representations also encode linear order , but in scobbie 's theory , linear order is formalized only for root nodes ( and is indicated with indices ) . a string of segments would then be represented as a set of indexed root matrices , essentially of the following sort . ( 2 ) indices are ordered by the relation immediate precedence ' ' . [ 1 ] with these structures , scobbie goes further and suggests that phonological rules should be traded in for constraints . these constraints , he suggests , are formally indistinct from the representations they apply to . ( a rather similar position has been advanced in ot . see russell , 1995 and hammond , to appear . ) for example , a generalization excluding mid nasal vowels would be expressed as follows . ( 3 ) such an expression rules out an element which is simultaneously specified [ - low ] , [ - high ] , and [ + nasal ] . constraints do n't actually "" apply "" to representations . rather , scobbie proposes , constraints are unified with representations . unification allows to representations to meld , just so long as they do n't conflict . for example , a representation consisting solely of ifferent elements . for example , the index variables below indicate that the two matrices share the token value for a , but merely share the type value for b . ( 6 ) scobbie develops this formalism in a number of ways . first , he argues that representations like the one above are subject to what he calls the sharing constraint ( p . 93 ) . ( 7 ) sharing constraint if a structure is dominated by two paths of type p with indices i and j , where , then for every index n where there is a path dominating m . the immediate effect of this is to rule out cases where noncontiguous root elements share a token value . scobbie argues that the evidence for such cases is weak . ( cf . a very similar proposal in archangeli & pulleyblank , 1994 . ) a more interesting consequence is that scobbie uses this constraint in an attempt to derive the no - crossing constraint ( ncc ) , part of goldsmith 's ( 1976 ) more general well - formedness condition on autosegmental representations . this is the constraint that rules out crossing autosegmental association lines . sagey ( 1986 ; 1988 ) first proposes to derive the ncc from a treatment of autosegmental association as overlap . however , hammond ( 1988 ) argues that this notion is formally problematic proposing a different characterization of association as a transitive , irreflexive , and asymmetric relation . hammond 's approach , however , does not derive the ncc without stipulation . scobbie 's approach also involves an asymmetric characterization of association ( as dominance ) , but does derive the ncc . scobbie 's derivation of the ncc is based on the assumption that there are no contour values . that is , while two different root nodes might share a value token as in the second picture below , one root node cannot bear two different values , as in the first picture below ( where "" s "" indicates a segment or root node and "" t "" indicates a tone or value token ) . ( 8 ) this is a necessary position given his formalization of sequencing : only root nodes bear an index for linear position ; nonroot tokens are unsequenced . ( a similar position is developed in heiberg , in prep . ) were contour values to be allowed , there would be no way to distinguish their ordering . on the other hand , when two root nodes share a value , their ordering is distinguished in terms of indices , as in ( 6 ) . the upshot of the prohibition on contours is that violations of the ncc can only arise when there is an independent sharing violation . that is , ncc violations look like ( 9 ) , and ( 9 ) necessarily includes a sharing violation . ( 9 ) this is a very nice result , but comes at the cost of i ) ruling out discontinuous association , and ii ) excluding contour values . scobbie also argues that his approach allows him to derive the phenomenon of geminate integrity ( hayes , 1986 ; schein & steriade , 1986 ) . the basic idea of geminate integrity is that geminates resist epenthesis . ( see guerssel , 1977 ; 1978 for an early treatment and suh , 1997 for a recent proposal . ) the standard account of this is that geminates resist epenthesis because the result would entail crossing association lines , and a violation of the ncc , as in ( 9 ) above . the problem with this , as noted by scobbie and others as well , is that if the epenthetic vowel is featureless ( 10 ) or inserted on another tier ( 11 ) , then no violation of the ncc occurs . ( 10 ) ( 11 ) scobbie 's own proposal is simple and direct . epenthesis into a geminate structure results in a violation of sharing , regardless whether the epenthetic vowel has features or whether its features might appear on some other tier . scobbie goes on to consider the possibility that geminate inalterability might also follow from the sharing constraint , but here his proposal is a lot more speculative . the basic idea pursued is that geminate inalterability results from default rules . the problem is that scobbie does n't really offer a clear proposal on the nature of default rules . on the face of it , they would seem to be a glaring problem for the monotonic theory he proposes . in his final substantive chapter , scobbie treats the problem of long-distance association , as in , e . g . arabic verbal morphology . he offers some well-taken criticisms of the traditional autosegmental approach , but does not really offer an explicit declarative counterproposal . in sum , this book is well worth reading . it offers a very interesting alternative constraint-based view of phonology with much to recommend it . on the other hand , there are a number of unresolved questions . what about floating segments ? scobbie speculates on this , but offers no satisfying solution . as noted above , contour segments are also ruled out , though the evidence for these in the tonal domain is unimpeachable .

Date: 2002-10-05T21:15:55-06:00I guess it's time to reveal the incredibly kind invitation I received[1]. As 
many of you may have found out or guessed, I will be attending oral argument 
for the Eldred case[2] before the Supreme Court. I'm incredibly excited, as you might imagine. Visiting the Supreme Court would 
be quite enough, but seeing such an important case...Dayenu! When Lessig asked 
me if I was free that day to come, I laughed because I couldn't (and still 
can't) think of anything I'd rather do than attend. I am eternally grateful to 
Lessig for the chance to attend. On the other hand, I'm sort of embarassed to 
have the opportunity, when there are surely others who deserve it far more than 
me. Luckily, it seems that such deserving others will be able to get seats by 
camping in line with us. So, I'll be arriving in D.C. on Tuesday, attending an 
Eldred/Duke/EPIC/Bookmobile superparty, and then camping in line with Seth 
Schoen[3], Lisa Rein, Jace Cooke but unfortunately not Cory Doctorow. If you'd 
like to come with us, let me know. I was hoping I'd be able to take notes and post them to my weblog for those who 
couldn't make it, but as I read in today's Times, only lawyers and those with 
official press credentials are allowed to take notes![4] I think this is 
outrageous, but hopefully I will be able to remember enough to provide an 
interesting account. In a related irony, today was ""Disney Day"" at Borders[5], where they played 
Disney rock songs with the volume turned up too loud, disturbing my usual habit 
of reading a book there. However, I did manage to skim through _The Practice of 
Programming_. In an unrelated note, if you haven't been electrocuted by a Model T spark plug, 
I highly recommend it.[1] http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000609

Darwin streaming media serverhttp://mpeg4ip.sourceforge.net/index.php
MPEG4IP: Open Source, Open Standards, Open StreamingMPEG4IP provides an end-to-end system to explore MPEG-4 multimedia. The
package includes many existing open source packages and the ""glue"" to
integrate them together. This is a tool for streaming video and audio that
is standards-oriented and free from proprietary protocols and extensions.Provided are an MPEG-4 AAC audio encoder, an MP3 encoder, two MPEG-4 video
encoders, an MP4 file creator and hinter, an IETF standards-based streaming
server, and an MPEG-4 player that can both stream and playback from local
file.Our development is focused on the Linux platform, and has been ported to
Windows, Solaris, FreeBSD, BSD/OS and Mac OS X, but it should be relatively
straight-forward to use on other platforms. Many of the included packages
are multi-platform already.
Both sound interesting, and low $$.- Jimhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

( eg . are mandarin [ de ] and cantonese [ dik ] diachronically related ? , etc . etc . ) question 2 : ( specific to hokkien and teochew ) most native speakers of hokkien and teochew , who are also speakers of mandarin , are of the opinion that there are two distinct markers exhibiting accidental homophony : a "" genitive "" / "" relative "" [ e ] / [ kai ] corresponding to mandarin [ de ] , and a "" classifier "" [ e ] / [ kai ] corresponding to mandarin [ ge ] . question 2a : is it demonstrably the case that [ e ] and [ kai ] are the respective products of diachronic coalescence of distinct forms at some earlier stage of the language ? question 2b : are there any valid synchronic arguments for positing two distinct lexical items , ie . two [ e ] 's in hokkien , and two [ kai ] 's in teochew ?

"threatened sudan languages ii . threatened sudan languages : response > from roger blench , cambridge i would like to thank the many people who responded to my posting on threatened languages of kordofan . it seems there is a large unsatisfied need out there to work with real speakers in situ , which is very encouraging for individuals such as myself who often feel marooned in the arid wastes of theory . i am attempting to set up a direct email address for those who have expressed interest and we will attempt to sort and answer all the queries with more detailed information as soon as possible . i append to this a few reflections occasioned by the response which you can ignore . 1 . of all the countries mailed the one major nation from which there was absolutely no response was england . this is disappointing , but not at all surprising . i had always suspected that both anthropology and field linguistics in england were closely bound up with the empire and that now the empire has gone , inward-looking has become the rule . anthropology i have had to largely discard now that the seminar rooms are awash with post-modernist chitchat , while linguistics seems bent on disappearing up its own theoretical orifices . 2 . the evident desire to go out and work with informants in context in order to actually assist communities ( as opposed to the parade of taxi-driver informants who have provided much of the "" african "" language material these last few years , especially in north america ) makes one ask why field linguistics has such a low prestige and why the making of dictionaries and the preparation of reference grammars is a barely acceptable activity ( as measured by the difficulty in getting these published ) . 3 . i posted a message about sudan , but every african country has threatened languages that require immediate attention . my work on the language atlas of nigeria ( finally published recently ) has made me aware of at least 50 languages in nigeria that are close to extinction . why , for example , is it easier to hold conferences and make up committees on threatened languages than to actually pay somebody to go out and do some basic work ? thank you again for the encouraging response . roger blench",Safe Email

"fw : a positive note about enron . move over carly fiorina . . . : - ) - - - - - original message - - - - - from : jaffry , adil sent : thursday , october 04 , 2001 9 : 32 am to : jafry , rahil subject : fw : a positive note about enron . fyi . . . from cbs . marketwatch . com , online at : attacks highlight enron ' s value by lisa sanders 3 : 02 am et oct 4 , 2001 houston ( cbs . mw ) - - in the wake of the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , one of the few places to buy or sell jet fuel was an online market maintained by enron . the attacks highlighted the houston company ' s strength as a manager of risk during periods of heightened uncertainty . through its trading centers , the company gives customers a way to hedge against volatility in oil , natural gas , and electricity markets , as well as other commodities . although the company lost one employee aboard one of the hijacked planes and closed its operations on the day of the attacks , its trading activity resumed the next day . by coming back online so fast , "" we made the decision to provide some stability in the market , "" said vance meyer , an enron spokesman . "" the customers really appreciated the fact that we were there , providing a place for them to maintain and adjust their positions in the market . "" in a financial sense , enron ( ene ) didn ' t suffer , meyer said . but employees at the enron building in downtown houston were badly shaken . nick humber , who worked for enron ' s wind energy business , died aboard a los angeles bound flight that crashed into the world trade center . "" we have offices in washington and new york , and people who had friends that died or were affected in some way , "" meyer said "" we also had traders who were on the phone with people in the world trade center when the planes hit . "" the decision to temporarily halt commodity trading on the new york mercantile exchange in the wake of the attacks "" may have increased volatility , a boon to the group , "" said bob christensen , analyst at fac / equities . companies that can defray volatility by helping customers manage their energy costs should be seeing a lot of business , he said . managing risk is what enron does best , market players say . and that strength should help the company going forward as u . s . businesses try to recover from the impact of september 11 . through its enrononline platform , the company buys and sells commodities at volumes totaling about $ 3 billion a day , meyer said . "" the world at large has become more risk averse , and enron , which is in the business of risk mitigation , should benefit from that , "" said glen hilton , senior analyst and portfolio manager for the montgomery new power fund , which has a stake in enron . "" with energy risk and prices potentially going up , they ' ll be the first number on many cfos ' speed dial . "" other companies do what enron does , but it ' s the best positioned to succeed because of its status as the leader in natural gas and power trading , measured in terms of volume . duke energy ( duk ) is the next - largest competitor , but it has one - third of enron ' s volume . high profile departure that ' s a good place to be for a company whose stock price has been on the skids since last year , though it grew 151 percent on the top line in 2000 . other problems notwithstanding , including its money - losing broadband business and its failure to sell the oregon utility portland general electric , enron ' s largest black eye came in mid - august when jeffrey skilling , chief executive since february , resigned abruptly . john hammerschmidt , senior portfolio manager of the turner new energy and power technology fund , said he "" freaked out "" when skilling left and managers immediately divested the turner large - cap portfolios of enron holdings . despite its status as a growth player , turner had re - entered the stock in june after a long absence because of valuation . at the time , enron was trading in the mid to high $ 40 s . "" this is a premier company and a premier industry , "" he said , adding that he believed then that the market had priced rumors into the stock . one of the rumors was that enron was about to take a big loss from being long on power when power prices were collapsing , hammerschmidt said . that has not materialized . whatever the problems were , hammerschmidt said , he felt them to be manageable . when skilling walked out , hammerschmidt began to believe some of the rumors might be true .

"I have about 60G of data which I need to copy from one disk to another.
However, I'm not sure how I should best copy it. The problem is the bulk of
the data is images and most of these image have two directory entries i.e.
there is a hard link to each file. If I copy them using cp -a or my usual
favourite of find .|cpio -pmd other_dir it's going to copy each file twice,
which is not what I want. dump / restore would take care of this if the
source filesystem wasn't reiserfs :-( Any suggestions ?

Thanks for that.  I'd sort of suspected that if it was a widespread
problem it would have already been fixed.  Starting to look more likely
it is a mistake/misconfiguration on my part, though I still don't know
where to look for the mistake/misconfiguration.

"Mr.Vincent Nnaji,
 Standard Trust Bank Ltd,
 Lagos,Nigeria.
 Dear Sir,
 I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 
On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch.
Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. 
On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 
According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.
 I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 
This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. 
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. 
Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. 
Thanks and Regards,
 MR.VINCENT NNAJI.",Phishing Email

verlag as volume 862 of the lectures notes in artificial intelligence , and the third international colloquium on grammatical inference , held at montpellier in france , the proceedings of which were published by springer - verlag as volume 1147 of the lecture notes in artificial intelligence . following the success of these events and the workshop on automata induction , grammatical inference , and language acquisition , held in conjunction with the international conference on machine learning at nashville in united states in july 1997 , the fourth international colloquium on grammatical inference will be held from july 12 through july 14 , 1998 , at iowa state university in united states . -

"So, last night around 5:30AM I'm woken up by a loud *craaack*, followed by
one of the most dreaded sounds a homeowner ever hears: vast quantities of
water spilling onto the floor. The water is coming from the bathroom, the
toilet specifically. Turns out the water cistern on the top of the toilet
had cracked down the side, and was spilling out all the water.So, after shutting off the water and mopping up, I was left to ponder what
are the odds of having mechanical failure of a large rectangular porcelain
bowl, in the absence of any visible stressors (like someone striking it with
a sledgehammer)? We hadn't done anything unusual to the toilet in the recent
past -- just normal use. I've *never* heard of this happening to anyone I
know. The guts, yeah, they fail all the time. But the storage bowl -- never.Geesh.- Jimhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",Safe Email
"books and articles on cd-rom this text is also available in german ( see below ) dear linguist readers throughout the last years the working conditions of many scientists have been profoundly changed through the introduction of modern data processing technology . almost every workplace is being equipped with a computer which , after hours or even days of patiently getting acquainted with the working procedure of these tools , constitutes an enormous advantage . this advantage especially shows in the ever more efficient saving , processing , and transferring of data . thus , as early as today , most of the manuscripts of books , articles , diplomas , and master 's theses are being processed through word processing programmes and are eventually available as a computer file . besides word processing , both newer , more rapid processors and more efficient programmes also make possible an ever higher integration of images , image sequences and sound recordings into a written text . accordingly , a phonetic transcription of an experiment can contain , in addition to the text , not only a recording of the language but also photographs of the articulating organs , such as mouth and upper jaw . that allows the experiment to be followed much more easily and also to be conducted by other scientists from a different view point . in addition to saving how the research work is done , it is also possible to save the subject of the research on any kind of storage media . in order to archive the amount of data resulting from this particular combination of text , sound and images , the compact disc ( cd ) has come more and more into fashion as the perfect storage medium . today , many publications are already available on cd . besides the possibility of a multi-media presentation of knowledge , the cd has one more advantage : because of the low production costs of a cd and its huge storage capacity , more publications of scientists can be made available than is currently possible in journals and books . at this point , the possibility emerges for young scientists as well as for renowned ones to publish their works that have up to now tended to disappear in some drawer because of either the publishing costs or a "" not-a - chance "" notion . with this as a background , i would like to begin a survey to determine to what extent the linguists of all fields might have interest in the following questions : 1 . ) is multi-media technology commonly accepted ? do linguists prefer traditional print media , or is there any interest in accepting knowledge from the computer screen ? 2 . ) is there any interest in publishing works which contain not only text but also images and sound ? what ideas are there on how to publish these scientific works ? 3 . ) who has experience using cds in the field of linguistics ? this survey is intended to serve as a basis for developing a concept for a new enterprise in the media services sector , which should provide next year 's young linguistically oriented post-graduate students a platform from which to work independently . i would like to thank you in advance for your answers and ideas . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ liebe linguist leser , in den letzten jahren hat sich die arbeitswelt vieler wissenschaftler durch die einfuehrung moderner techniken der datenverarbeitung grundlegend geaendert . fast jeder arbeitsplatz ist mit einem computer ausgestattet , der nach einigen geduldigen stunden und tagen des kennenlernens der wirkungsweise dieser geraete , einen enormen arbeitsvorteil darstellt . dieser vorteil besteht insbesondere in der mehr und mehr komfortableren erfassung , verarbeitung und weitergabe von daten . so werden die meisten niederschriften von buechern , artikeln , diplom - und magisterarbeiten bereits heute durch textverarbeitungsprogramme bearbeitet und liegen letztendlich als eine datei vor . neue und schnellere rechner sowie leistungsfaehigere programme machen neben der bearbeitung von text auch mehr und mehr eine integration von bildern , bildsequenzen und tonaufnahmen in eine niederschrift moeglich . so kann z . b . eine phonetische niederschrift ueber ein lautsprachliches experiment neben den schriftlichen ausfuehrungen auch die sprachaufnahmen enthalten , aber auch bildaufnahmen der artikulierenden organe , wie mund und unterkiefer ; damit ist dieses experiment besser nachvollziehbar und koennte unter anderen gesichtspunkten von dritten wissenschaftlern ebenfalls durchgefuehrt werden . es ist also moeglich , in vielen faellen neben den ausfuehrungen einer untersuchung , auch den untersuchungsgegenstand auf einen datentraeger zu speichern . um diese mengen an daten , die durch die kombination von text , bild und ton entstehen , zu archivieren , bewaehrt sich immer mehr die cd als speichermedium . viele veroeffentlichungen erscheinen schon heute auf cd . neben der moeglichkeit einer multi - media darstellung von wissen , hat die cd aber noch einen weiteren vorteil : aufgrund der niedrigen herstellungskosten einer cd und der riesigen menge an speicherplatz wird es moeglich , publikationen von mehr wissenschaftlern zu veroeffentlichen , als es mit herkoemmlichen journalen und buechern moeglich ist . hier ergibt sich fuer junge wissenschaftler , aber auch fuer renommierte die moeglichkeit , ihre niederschriften an die oeffentlichkeit zu bringen , die bisher , bedingt durch preis und ` chancenlosigkeit ' , eher in der schublade verschwanden . mit diesem hintergrund versehen , wuerde ich gern eine umfrage starten , inwieweit linguisten aller gebiete ein interesse an folgenden themen zeigen : 1 . ) gibt es eine allgemeine akzeptanz der multi - media technik . greifen linguisten lieber auf traditionell gedruckte literatur zurueck , oder besteht auch ein interesse an der wissensaufnahme durch den bildschirm . 2 . ) interessiert sich jemand fuer eine veroeffentlichung eigener arbeiten , die neben text auch bild und ton enthalten . welche vorstellungen gibt es ueber eine solche art und weise der publikation von wissenschaftlichen arbeiten . 3 . ) wer hat schon erfahrungen in der sprachwissenschaftlichen anwendung von cd 's gesammelt ? diese umfrage steht in dienst einer konzeptentwicklung fuer ein neues unternehmen im medien - dienstleistungsbereich , das fuer jungen , sprachwissenschaftlich orientierten studenten nach abschluss des studiums im naechsten jahr die basis fuer eine eigenstaendige arbeiten bilden soll . bereits im voraus bedanke ich mich fuer ihre antworten und anregungen . ingolf franke zeughausstrasse 31 d-54292 trier germany tel .

just like i do when i watch mass media.  and yes, from the one irish
course i took in dublin, they do the national anthem.  which is fine
really - i started off each day in school in america with the pledge of
allegience (with the under god bit in it which annoyed my dad to no end).

there's a huge opportunity for a fully irish computing environment in
free software.  and yet i don't see much action from official irish
organisations.  the reason mandrake and some others have the irish

History is written by the victors. If the rabble can put forth there ideas
they will be tempered in the pages of yore as ""strong willed voices

support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is
nobody's problem but Habeas's.A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of
incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yet
to think of an incentive that fits the bill ...On Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Justin Mason wrote:> I don't see a problem supporting it in SpamAssassin -- but I see Dan's

its incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject
at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).  
If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,
there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their
thresholds to 5.On Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Michael Moncur wrote:> But I agree that there needs to be more focus on eliminating rules that

of at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message
basis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.On Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Harold Hallikainen wrote:> Habeus has come up with a very clever way to use existing law to battle

and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g.,
SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then
spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.  There's nobody
left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their
will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark.Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to
make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose
for which it was designed.Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against
real spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,
then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights
to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both
created and monopolized a market for ""internet postage stamps"" that
everybody has to pay them for.The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do
absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with
lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly
from everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the
privilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don't believe they'll
ever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it.[*] And I use the term ""they"" loosely, because the whole company could 
consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.-------------------------------------------------------

"Hello all,
I'm trying to get wins name resolution across subnets working and reckon the
first step is to be 
able to do a nmblookup without using the -B (broadcast address flag). Does
anyone know how 
samba can be configured to do broadcasts to subnets other than just the
local subnet. 
I don't think this has anything to do with the remote announce parameter.Thanks
Bryan

"Has anyone considered the fact that these occurrances appear to
be increasing. I'm aware that maybe more publicity surrounding
some and certain agencies have been granted more funding, but 
I'd like to see some data which shows if these are increasing
or not. Why? Well, it seems to me if we were going to get hit, the one
that does it may have been part of a larger swarm or cluster
which has over the years increased the distance between the
rocks. Like the Schumaker Levy-9, which had multiple rocks
all impacting at different times, others may have this same
type of design and could be in different stages of increasing
distance from one another. Also to consider is if SL-9 was
on course for earth, would we get hit by all rocks or only
one because the earth is a much smaller target than Jupiter?So, my theory is that if these near earth rocks are increasing
so does our chance of discovering the last three were part of
a swarm of 15 of which 10, 11 and 12 may hit.On 24-Jul-2002, bitbitch@magnesium.net wrote:

"summary : in other words dear netters , i have posted several queries a few months ago . about ten members of the linguist list answered me by e-mails . i must show great thanks especially to prof . welchsler , prof . jewett , prof . edwards ( who sent me examples of iow from london - lund corpus ) , prof . patrikis , prof . spackman , prof . macrakis , prof . alvarez - caccamo , prof . harris , prof . huettner , and dr . georgia green ( who introduced me "" two types of convention in indirect speech acts "" by j . l . morgan , contained in the volume : _ syntax and semantics , vol . 9 : pragmatics _ edited by peter cole ( 1978 , new york : academic press ) . the following are my own summary . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * in this summary , i propose the hearer 's implicature / implication - interpretation process ( prof . alvarez - caccamo 's suggestion ) , which constrains on the use of in other words ( iow ) in english . i would distinguish between speaker 's intended implicature and hearer 's interpreted implicature . thus , speaker a may have the intention to implicate x , but hearer b may very well fail to recognize such impli - cature or else may interpret some other . even if b correctly interprets a 's intention , b 's interpretation depends largely upon the context and / or background assumption . the use of iow is such a case . a dictionary edited by ball ( 1986 ) calls such usage "" inferential function "" , though he uses the term rather informally in the dictionary . i will follow his terminology just for the sake of convenience . the inferential use of iow frequently occurs between the two people 's dialogue . ( 1 ) a : i ' m afraid there is n't much i can help you with . b : _ in other words _ , you do n't want to be bothered . although the interpretation process of ( 1 ) is very close to what is called "" conventional "" use , i . e . it might be processed spontaneously , without any inferential process in the hearer 's mind , b guesses a 's real intent , which is not directly inferred from a 's utterance , but indirect - ly from a 's implicature . in order for b to necessitate iow , b exploits his / her background assumption / encyclopedic knowledge , implicating that a is busy now , or a does n't feel at ease with b . let the implicature just explained be c , then a sequential flow of consciousness / inferential process such as a $ @ "" * ( jc $ @ "" * ( jb emerges . iow is a visible index of the hearer 's implicature-interpretation process . speaker / hearer 's background assumption varies between common sense and the knowledge which is only valid between the speaker and hearer . ( 2 ) a : i love schubert 's late piano sonatas . b : _ in other words _ , you do n't like the beethoven sonatas ? iow in ( 2b ) is derived by the use of a restricted set of background assumption in which b has already admired the beethoven sonatas . b assumes that a is also an admirer of beethoven , but contrary to b 's assumption a declares an admiration for schubert . so , b feels criticism in a 's words . b 's background assumption becomes an old information , conflates a 's new information and enables iow to create a = b . "" non - conventional "" , rather complicated use of iow is the following . ( 3 ) a : i ' m going to kill you . b : _ in other words _ , you 'd like it if i moved my car . for example , b 's car stands in the way of a 's car , so that a gets infuriated at b . the situation like the above gets a to utter such harsh words ; kill you . a 's real intent , in this case implicature / implication , is "" i ' m going to kill you if you do n't move your car "" , or simply "" move your car "" , which is labelled as c again . b , beginning with iow , paraphrases c by b 's own words . again in order for b to use iow , h / she must infer that a assumes / implicates c . background assumption mitigates b 's processing effort . if not , b processes too much effort and cannot interpret a 's words . b 's job here is to process the flow of the dialogue like a $ @ "" * ( jc $ @ ! a ( jb . b 's failure to process / infer the flow of the dialogue sometimes occurs . ( 1 ' ) a : i ' m afraid there is n't much i can help you with . b ' : ? _ in other words _ , you need to be helped . in the context where a really needs help , s / he does n't bother to say that s / he can't help b ' . if a 's hands are full of the parcels and he visibly needs help , so that s / he says s / he can't help b ' , there is a possibility of b ' saying it is you who need to be helped . however , this is a very insulting comment , because b ' actually implies that if you can't help me , you are not a capable person . so , you are the one who needs help . another completely misled example of inference is the following . ( 4 ) a : sorry , i can't help you now , because i ' m busy . b : * _ in other words _ , you ' re busy . unacceptability of b comes from a 's words _ because i ' m busy _ , where a has already spoken out his own implicature c . mere repetition cannot be allowed in iow 's case . if something extra can be implied in b 's response , type of ( 4 ) is ok . ( 5 ) a : sorry , i can't help you now . b : _ in other words _ , you can't . ( - ) ' you really can't . ' ) in summary , an utterance "" a . in other words , b "" has an inferential process / hearer 's interpretive process "" a $ @ "" * ( jc ; in other words c $ @ ! a ( jb "" . iow can be campared with 's o ' and ' then , ' etc . the following results are the above contributors ' reactions . ( * ) means that there are some who judge a sentence acceptable and others unacceptable . ' so ' : $ @ ! ! ( j ( 6 ) a . there was $ 5 in his wallet . { _ so _ / ( * ) _ in other words _ } he had n't spent all the money . b . she 's your teacher . { _ so _ / ( * ) _ in other words _ } you must respect her . $ @ ! ! ( j ( 7 ) playing the french horn . a : anyway , the horn makes funny noises . { _ so _ / ( * ) _ in other words _ } it 's a treacherous instrument , is n't it ? it 's something that is very hard for you to control . why is that ? too much spit , or what ? b : i ' m glad you ' ve used that term . because it 's not difficult . it is treacherous . so are the players , of course . but that 's another story . $ @ ! ! ( j ( 8 ) tom ate condemned meat . { _ so _ / * _ in other words _ } he felt ill . $ @ ! ! ( j ( 9 ) bill insulted mary . { _ so _ / _ in other words _ } she left . in contrast with resultative 's o 's ' in ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , two 's o 's ' in ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) are sequential . in the case of iow , one is ok and the other is out . ( 9 ) can be interpreted that bill 's insulting mary always leads to her leaving ( here ) , so that iow is permitted . iow in ( 8 ) is n't ok because eating condemned meat always equals to his feeling ill , in which case iow in such situation is redundant / meaningless / uninformative . ' then ' : $ @ ! ! ( j ( 10 ) an insurance man visits a girl he knows . he has brought her a policy application for signature . they talked about her husband . girl : i ' m expecting robert home soon . insurance salesman : oh ! why ? is he in trouble ? g : no . he 's thinking of setting up in business on his own . is : oh , good for him . g : you think it 's a good idea ? is : yes , why not ? g : small businesses are going bust all over the place . is : so , there are millions of people on the dole right now who thought they were safe and secure working for someone else . { _ so _ / _ in other words _ / ( * ) _ then _ } , now 's the time to have a go . there 's nothing else to lose anyway . g : think so ? is : yes . ' in that case ' : $ @ ! ! ( j ( 11 ) a : i ' m afraid there is n't much i can help you with . b : { _ in that case _ / ( * ) _ in other words _ } i shall have to ask someone else . ' that is ' : $ @ ! ! ( j ( 12 ) they took refreshments , { _ that is _ / * _ in other words _ } , sand - witches , coffee , beer , fruit juice , and chocolate . ball ( 1986 ) explains that ' that is ' is open-ended and iow is closed - ended . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * if you have further comments on my analyisis of iow above , please do n't hesitate to e-mail me . thanks very much for all the help you have given . sincerely , hiroaki tanaka associate professor , tokushima university , japan . e-mail : gca01363 @ niftyserve . or . jp",Safe Email

"re : 5 . 1254 typological classification for what it is worth , i disagree with martin haspelmath ( and agree with fritz newmeyer ) about the problem of defining the concepts with which typological work operates . but we need to make sure that this does not become a political thing : i do n't see any difference on this point between the work of typologists / functionalists as compared to that of formalists . everybody who tries to compare two or more languages has these problems . for ex . , in reference to the basic word order question , i noticed a long time ago that some languages which were claimed to have ovs as basic actually rarely had both o and s at the same time in the same sentence , so i argued that maybe the term "" basic "" should not be applied there in the way in which it applies to english svo patterns . there are many many examples where we compare incomparables and do not compare comparables because our concepts are vague and our terminologies are ambiguous . i have , for example , published some papers documenting the confusions surrounding the term ' topic ' in the typological literature . there seems to be a lot of confusion likewise about the concepts of ' ergative ' and ' passive ' . and it seems to me that typological categories such as ' configurational ' ( or non ) , ' pro-drop ' ( or non ) , and so on , are just as poorly defined and just as liable to lead to all kinds of confusion .",Safe Email
">>>>> ""E"" == Elias Sinderson  writes:    E> ... The strength to weight ratio of a spider is so high
    E> that Spiderman is able to throw a bus several city blocks with

humanoid cells are in fact exo-skeletally structured with more atoms
per cubic angstrom to achieve the distance-squared tensile strength
enhancements we find when we introduce smaller metal atoms between the
lattice packed grid of iron atoms to create steel?  This 'steel-effect' might give bone structure and tendons dramatically
(several orders of magnitude) more tensile strength without the need
to significantly increase the weight (like magnesium-alloy or
carbon-fiber weight compared to iron, Spidey could even be way under
weight).  Only increasing tensile strength could accommodate the
mobility and leverage feats since bones are actually formed from
bubbles of organic material hydrolically assisted, tensile strength
cross-sectionally would give his frame the strength to withstand the
muscular enhancement.    E> As for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK
    E> not really well explained in the comic series. If the same close-packing gap-filling arachne-molecular structure
modification occurs in neural tissues, and there'd be no reason to
think that these would grow differently from bones and tendons, then
what we are seeing in spidey sense is no more than the heightened
cerebral functions due to shorter/faster/stronger synapses throughout
the entire nervous system.  Since we know dogs and cats measure human emotions by smell, clearly
hearing the heartbeats, and other subtle clues within their normal
sensory ranges (but seem mystical to us) ...  for Peter Parker,
everything from air currents on his facial-hairs to extremely subtle
hormone smells might coallesce into a general gestalt of Spidey-Sense;
don't forget that he'd acquired this ability in adolescence and thus
would lack any cultural or even pathological basis to explain the
heightened awareness to himself in anything but mystical terms. We
know from issue #1 that his collision-avoidance reflex response time
was far swifter than his cognitive awareness since he 'found' himself
already stuck to the tree when the bicycle was already past and hence
his disorientation (""You ok, Mister?"") as if it was a hallucination.Hmmm ... it may even be physio-psychologically interesting to examine
if Peter Parker's personal quandries arose _because_ his physiological
'Spidey' infrastructure had been advanced whereas his psychological
perception of his self had not, ie, ""Peter"" was not ""Spiderman"" but
just the ""driver of the bus"".  Only, unlike ourselves, he found his
self driving a body-vehicle not evolutionarily matched to his
cognitive time-scales.--

"FROM:MR JOE MARK
EMAIL FAX: 1 561 619 2791
EMAIL:mrjoemark@yahoo.comDEAR SIR
 
REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP ï¿½ STRICTLY
CONFIDENTIAL.
 
Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality
in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and ï¿½TOP SECRET.ï¿½ Though
I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make
anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you
that all will be well at the end of the day. We have decided to contact you first by your email due
to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been
reliably informed that it will take at least two to
three weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we
decided it is best using the email. Let me start by
first introducing myself properly to you. I am Dr.
Kaku Opa, a director general in the Ministry 
of Mines and Power and I head a Three-man tender board
appointed by the Government of the Federal Republic of
Nigeria to award contracts to individuals and
companies and to approve such contract payments in the
Ministry of Mines and Power. The duties of the
committee also include evaluation, vetting and
monitoring of work done by foreign and local
contractors in the ministry.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
business transaction which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring
maximum confidence. In order to commence this
business, we solicit for your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said funds. The source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996
and 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various
contractors for engineering, procurement, supply of
electrical equipments such as Transformers, and some
rural electrification projects. However, these contracts were over-invoiced by the
committee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million
dollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United
States Dollars) in excess. This was done with the
intention that the committee will share the excess
when the payments are approved. The Federal Government have since approved the total
contract sum which has been paid out to the companies
and contractors concerned which executed the
contracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,
which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe
off-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst
ourselves.We need your assistance as the funds are presently
secured in an escrow account of the Federal Government
specifically set aside for the settlement of
outstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are
handicapped 
in the circumstances as the civil service code of
conduct, does not allow us to operate off-shore
accounts, hence your importance in the whole
transaction. My colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your
company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on
our behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the
total amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%
will be for us (members of this panel) and the
remaining 10% will be used in offsetting all
debts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in
the cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return
we demand your complete honesty and trust. It does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of this nature described here, the
assumption is that your company won the major contract
and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More
often than not, big trading companies or firms of
unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract
to more specialized firms for execution of such
contracts. We are civil servants and we will not want
to miss this once in a life time opportunity.You must however, NOTE that this transaction will be
strictly based on the following terms and conditions
as we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed
cases of business associates running away with funds
kept in their custody when it finally arrive their
accounts. We have decided that this transaction will
be based completely on the following: (a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence. (b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. (c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly
release our share (70%) on demand after you have
removed your 20% and all expenses have been settled. (d). You must be ready to produce us with enough
information about yourself to put our minds at rest. Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude the business in Ten
Bank working days from the date of  receipt of the
necessary information and requirement from you. Endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter
using my email fax number 1 561 619 2791 or my email
address mrjoemark@yahoo.com. I will bring you into
the
complete picture of the transaction when I have heard
from you. Your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we
are already behind schedule for this financial
quarter. Thank you and God bless. Yours faithfully, Mr Joe Mark__________________________________________________

"a better investment than the stock market . all our mailings are sent complying to the proposed h . r . 3113 unsolicited commercial electronic mail act of 2000 . please see the bottom of this message for further information and removal instructions . parents of 15 - year old - find $ 71 , 000 cash hidden in his closet ! does this headline look familiar ? of course it does . you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( usa ) . and reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods - new zealand ) . his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 - year - old sons closet . nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . five - dollar bills , twenties , fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber - banded in labelled piles . "" my first thought was that he had robbed a bank "" , says the 41 - year - old woman , "" there was over $ 71 , 000 dollars in that bag - - that ' s more than my husband earns in a year "" . the woman immediately called her husband at the car - dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via e - mail , a type of "" report "" to e - mail addresses that he obtained off the internet . everyday after school for the past 2 months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . "" i just got the e - mail one day and i figured what the heck , i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out "" , says the clever 15 - year - old . the e - mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $ 5 dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five - dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5 - address list . "" i get junk e - mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work "" , the boy continues . within the first few days of sending out the e - mail , the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video - game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ 5 bills . "" about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it . there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . i thought i was in trouble or something ( laughs ) "" . he goes on , "" i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all "" . over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the e - mail . "" the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework "" . he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ 5 bills for twenties , fifties and hundreds . "" i didn ' t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack . i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money ] and he was outside waiting for me . one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it , but i just rode to the next bank down the street ( laughs ) .

there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . = order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper or aluminum foil . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 : the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net order report # 1 from : r . r . po box 18048 chicago , il 60618 report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk e - mail on the net order report # 2 from : gm boland 353 jonestown rd . suite 125 winston salem , nc 27104 report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net order report # 3 from : r . chernick po box 771661 c . s . florida 33077 report # 4 : how to become a millionaire utilizing mlm & the net order report # 4 from : m . eiseman po box 451971 sunrise , florida 33345 - 1971 report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free order report # 5 from : l . samon po box 31 castletown isle of man im 99 5 xp $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : + + + if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do . = orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . + + + once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business ! ! ! following is a note from the originator of this program : you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with no risk and just a little bit of effort . you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 thru # 5 as instructed above . one of the people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on every one of them . remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to you now ! + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + more testimonials + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + "" my name is mitchell . my wife , jody and i live in chicago . i am an accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good money . when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving "" junk mail "" . i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i "" knew "" it wouldn ' t work . jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old "" i told you so "" on her when the thing didn ' t work . well , the laugh was on me ! within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses . within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147 , 200 . 00 . . . . all cash ! i was shocked . i have joined jody in her "" hobby "" . mitchell wolf , chicago , illinois "" not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn ' t get enough orders to at least get my money back "" .

unify performance issues are priority number one most of you are aware that unify experienced some major performance issues as we tried to close out the month of july . not to go into any details but there seemed to be a lot of smaller issues which when combined caused the issues we saw on monday and to a lesser degree on tuesday . almost all of the issues relate to the quirkiness of the current version of sybase which is used for unify ' s database . jeff johnson and his team are putting together a plan that will address most of these issues and hopefully result in acceptable performance as we go through next bidweek and try to close for august . the short term tactical plans include the following : enhancing certain programs which seem to have become resource hogs as the amount of data grows . test and hopefully migrate to the latest version of sybase which will address some of the issues . this may also require some hardware changes as to where we store certain data . we will also need some user help in stress testing prior to moving to production . addressing with the users billing transactions that have never been finaled . i have been told that we still have transactions going back to jan of 99 that have not been finaled or closed out . this puts quite a load on the pma and accrual process since it has to go back to those open transactions to see what if any action should be taken with these transactions . once these changes have been implemented and hopefully bought us a little time to absorb the tremendous growth we ' ve been seeing via eol then we will focus on delivering more intermediate and longer term solutions . these include the following : rewriting most of the code and moving to a 3 tier environment which will be much more scalable . moving off of sybase and on to microsoft sql server or oracle . it will be easier to move microsoft sql server but we have to be sure it is the right solution in the long term . jeff will be following up with some of you to go over a much more detailed plan . needless to say that this is his groups highest priority and his best people are working on these efforts . this will slow down major enhancement efforts such as enhancing the gas applications to handle hourly trades and nominations . we will keep you informed as we start to roll out the tactical solutions . in the mean time feel free to contact me at x - 36858 or jeff at x - 39694 if you have any questions or require additional detail . thanks ! - tommy,Safe Email

The right to speak is not the same as the right to be heard by the audience
of the speakers choice.Disruptive protests might be a means to create awareness - but that's a
pretty lame way to do it. If it truly is the only way, then I'm all for it,

           Product: Spamassassin
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: Other
        OS/Version: other
            Status: NEW
          Severity: enhancement

        ReportedBy: matt@nightrealms.com
Inspired by complaints about all-image or mostly-image spam that's
getting by SA, I've cooked up three sets of rules that analyze the use
of IMG tags in HTML: one that looks at the total area of all of the
images in the message (T_HTML_IMAGE_AREA*), one that looks at the
total number of images in the message (T_HTML_NUM_IMGS*), and one that
looks at the longest total run of consecutive images
(T_HTML_CONSEC_IMG*).===============The total area of all images is rather easy to compute: inside of

have IMG tags interspersed with table, paragraph and linebreak tags,
and some whitespace, so there would be a lot of IMG tags with no plain
text (non-whitespace) between them.  So I defined consecutive IMG tags
to be ones with no text between them, and looked at the longest run of
consecutive IMGs within a message.This one seems to do pretty good, because in my non-spam corpus
there's only a handful of messages with IMG runs larger than two.  0.450    1.418    0.000    1.00    0.78    0.01  T_HTML_CONSEC_IMGS06

I suppose it is - however, nobody knows that
this message is a response to your one or a 
follow-up to my own first message. With a newsgroup structure, this is obvious. This helps the reader eliminate threads which

"a practical matter, I doubt the value sold in such situations ever adds up to the value lost. And the non-pecuiary since of violation, loss, and trouble has to get in there somewhere if we are really picky.I don't think considering marginal utility of dollars has value in this situation. We aren't debating whether the thief is better off -- he is.I'm not a lawyer either. I played one on TV once but I didn't play a very good one and they canceled it after the first episode ...The situtation I described came from my recollection of Epstein's 'Takings'. He was specifically rejecting the idea of absolute property right found in Liberation theology and was using the idea -- that in an emergency where my life depends upon it I'm entitled to violate your property rights and (more) you are forbidden from using unreasonable force to defend them (particularly if you aren't around).Maybe I did get it all wrong, but that particular recollection is relatively strong precisely because it gave a good reason why my libertarian theology needed to be modified.He was also analyzing what the common law had come up with, which might not be the statuatory law in a particular jurisdiction.> -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of > Russell Turpin > Sent: Monday, August 12, 2002 2:15 PM > To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org > Subject: RE: David Friedman: Mail Me the Money! > > John Hall: > >The case against theft also acknowledges that the value to the thief is > >often far less than the value to the victim.

today!I don't usually spend much time explaining metaphors. They are, after all, 
metaphorical. They can be filled with whatever symbolism you choose. Written 
well, we all come to some similar understanding of their meaning. But, I'll 
depart today, contrary to my normal practice, to take a few minutes explaining a 
recent metaphor.I'm a Linux guy through and through. As a user, I see myself as right about at 
the average on the curve. For love of the language and open source attitude, 
though, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone with quite the same level of 
enthusiasm. Put simply, there's very little about the Linux and broader open 
source worlds that I don't like or believe in.Take, for example, the practice of recursive acronyms. GNU (""Gnu's Not Unix""), 
HURD (""Herd of Unix-Replacing Daemons""), WINE (""Wine Is Not an Emulator""), even 
PHP (""PHP Hypertext Processor"") - all carry on the tradition of recursion in the 
Unix/Linux world. Goofy as it sounds, I love this stuff.So it is that I set out to create a recursive metaphor last week. It could only 
have happened on or about the 4th of July. In fact, it happened in the edition 
of the 3rd. I wrote a piece about how we Americans spend more time over the 
course of a year talking about what's wrong with our system than what's 
right. I wrote it knowing full well that many of the responses I'd get would be 
a) from readers outside the US and b) in sharp disagreement to my comments or 
those of citizens of other countries. You're following me, right? People would 
disagree with an article that said we spend much time disagreeing. This, of 
course, would prove my point in a somewhat metaphorical way - the perfect 
recursive metaphor. The point was to be made yet more perfectly by the eventual 
inclusion in Penguin Shell of the comments of someone from outside the US 
disagreeing with my take our argumentativeness as Americans. Ideally, they would 
be comments that disagreed with our collective American perception of being 
disagreeable. They would, of course, point out things about which citizens of 
other countries can disagree with Americans on. By exercising the right to 
disagree, we'd subtly agree that we have that right. Yet another level of 
recursion and a final layer of metaphor.The response to both my own and Johan Sauviller's comments was overwhelming. In 
the main, I believe both were appreciated. Many commented on the balance of the 
two pieces. Some readers were surprised, I think, to see a dissenting opinion 
published so quickly, if at all. Overall, the ability to express honestly held 
opinions, to agree and to disagree on a global level closed the circle on the 
metaphor in a perfect way.Things have, however, gotten a bit more ugly in the past few days. I'm not sure 
whether some were slow in getting to the July 3rd issue, or whether it's just 
been stewing since then. Take, for instance, these comments by a reader who will 
remain mercifully nameless:
We get enough
America bashing from our left-wing whacko extremist press and schools here
in the USA that we don't wish to hear some (insert favorite adjective here)
from Belgium whining too!
Followed by:
... please don't let Tony single-handedly tarnish the fine reputation
of Lockergnome. I'm sure there are other articulate Linux experts out there who 
would be able to replace him.
... and, in a later note on the topic ...
Censorship is to be encouraged in a
free-market society whenever and wherever it doesn't come from the
government.
Clearly, the metaphor just whizzed right over the heads of some.
Chris 
has been great about allowing all his authors plenty of room in the editorial 
piece at the beginning of each newsletter. This particular piece is no 
exception. He's shown a quiet confidence in the face of some very shrill 
comments. While we all generally stay focused on technical issues, Chris has 
shown unwavering support for the notion that we geeks are, in the end, humans 
with opinions and thoughts to share. I think it's one of the things that makes 
the Lockergnome newsletters stand out from the pack - the personal touch.So, despite the irrationality of some of this week's comments, I'll continue to 
occasionally throw in a personal aside with the technical stuff.Just watch out. Recursive metaphors are only funny until someone puts an eye 
out.

Office and CrossOver Plugin. You've probably heard of both by now, as they've 
garnered quite a bit of publicity both in and out of the Linux world. You'll 
recall that I promised to try to secure copies for review this week. With the 
help of a friendly sales rep at CodeWeavers, I was able to accomplish that task 
this morning. True to the second half of the promise, we'll spend the next few 
days looking at these two products and how they might impact your Linux use. 
Let's take them in chronological order, starting today with CrossOver Plugin.A bit of background is in order. CodeWeavers is, in their own words, "" ... the 
leading corporate backer of the Wine Project. Wine has been, for the past several years, an 
ongoing project to port Windows applications to Linux. It's a tough goal, but 
it's also one that's been undertaken by others in the past year or so. Though the progress has been 
slow, the Wine project has managed to stay at the front of this development 
realm.
CrossOver 
Plugin marks a change in the philosophy of the Wine Project. Prior to its 
release, Wine had taken a ""full system"" approach. Running Windows applications 
in Wine required the installation of a sizeable daemon and no small amount of 
configuration work. CrossOver Plugin has moved Wine away from the system-wide 
approach to one that's much more modular. Rather than executing at system 
startup, Wine is called as-needed, with the virtual Windows path to the called 
program. When the program is closed, so is Wine. CrossOver Plugin has focused on creating Linux functionality with one related set of Windows 
applications: browser plugins.The results stand as a clear indication that the change in philosophy is a 
success. Off the top, CrossOver Plugin bundles QuickTime 5, Windows Media Player 6.2, Shockwave 8.5, Flash 6, and RealPlayer 8 into a Linux-accesible browser 
plugin package. Throw in more esoteric apps like IPix, Trillian, Authorware Web 
Player 6 and eFax Messenger 2, and you've got virtually every need plugin need 
covered.But this package doesn't stop there. Included in the CrossOver Plugin package 
are viewers for Word, Excel and Powerpoint, as well as several 
Microsoft-oriented fonts. Honestly, I was stunned at the range of applications 
offered by the CodeWeavers developers.Having had some experience with Wine, I was a bit leery about the install 
process and about the ability to get all these great applications to work with 
my RedHat setup. I've never been completely successful with Wine, but I hoped 
for the best when I started the CrossOver Plugin installation. I really did want these apps to work.The installation was quite easy. By running the install-crossover.sh script from the command line, I was able to install the installers for both CrossOver Plugin and CrossOver Office, which we'll talk about tomorrow. I started the plugin 
installs with QuickTime, a tool I've admittedly missed in Linux. In the 
background, CrossOver Plugin had already created a virtual C:\ drive on my 
machine. I clicked on the QuickTime install and immediately saw a familiar sight - the Vise installer in its Windows format. CrossOver Plugin first checked for 
feedback from the Windows binary, opened a virtual Windows window, then stepped 
out while the Vise installer took care of the rest. Though the install failed 
four times, it appeared to be a server failure rather than a failure of the 
CrossOver program. I kept ""retry""ing and, with some persistence, managed to get 
a full QuickTime 5 install downloaded from the Apple servers. Quite literally, 
the install looked and performed exactly as I've seem many times in Windows. 
When the install was completed, CrossOver again checked for the Windows binary, 
located the appropriate .dll files in the virtual C:\ drive and dropped the 
plugins into the /home/tony/.netscape/plugins and /home/tony/.mozilla/plugins 
directories.The process was so smooth that I had to check the plugin listings in these 
browsers - ""Help"", ""About Plugins."" Sure enough, the CrossOver QuickTime plugin 
was listed. Quickly, I ran out to the Apple site and opened the ""Men In Black 
II"" movie trailer. QuickTime performed flawlessly.I followed with the Windows Media Player, Shockwave, Flash, IPix, and eFax 
Messenger installs. Of those, the only ones that weren't self-contained in the 
CrossOver install were IPix and eFax. Even at that, the installer pointed me to 
the Windows download then found the .exe file when the download was done. Within a half-hour, I had all installed and tested.Then, just for grins, I installed RealPlayer 8 via CrossOver. This was despite 
the recommendation in the installer screen to use the Linux version. It went as 
smoothly as the others with one caveat - the player played media files at a much faster speed than that in Windows. Fast enough to make me laugh, in fact, 
reminded of Dave and Alvin the Chipmunk. Ah well, six out of seven is pretty 
strong given my previous troubles with Wine.I also installed a few fonts - Arial, Times New Roman, Trebuchet, and Veranda. 
In every case, the install was quick and absolutely painless.Wine has always held great promise. At times, it's been painful to watch the 
tedious pace of development, only because that promise was so alluring. With the backing of CodeWeavers and a fundamental change in the approach to development, 
Wine has finally realized the goal of integrating Windows applications 
seamlessly into the stable Linux environment. The results are so strong that, if I didn't know better, I'd swear that a few of these plugins actually run better 
in Linux than in their native Windows. Honestly, I didn't realize how much I 
missed them until I started using them in Linux today.Tomorrow holds a few surpirses, with a look at CodeWeavers' CrossOver Office 
package.

Kernel Configuration - Part IXWe're nine parts into the kernel configuration series, with quite a bit yet to 
go. If you haven't been following along, we're breaking out the configuration 
screens one at a time in an attempt to shed some light on the purpose and 
function of each. With that knowledge, you should be able to make a clear 
decision as to how to configure each section.Today, it's the Parallel Port support section. This is pretty simple. If you 
need parallel port support - such as for a printer - select this option either 
as a driver built into the kernel or as a loadable module.Most will use the PC-style hardware option in conjuction with a Windows printer. But that's not all the parallel port can be used for. As an example, the builds 
I did with the telescope company required parallel port support, as the 
telescope cameras were attached to this port.Be aware - this kernel configuration option only makes a driver available for 
the parallel port. The computer's BIOS sets the mode for the port - ECP, EPP, or Auto. On the majority of modern computers, the Auto mode is the default and will work just fine. However, if you have problems communicating with your printer 
following a kernel recompile, try changing the mode of your printer in the 
BIOS.Tomorrow, it's Plug and Play configuration.

Netics 2.0http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/marius/netics/""Netics is an extensible network statistics collector. It puts the network 
interface in promiscuous mode and reads the data stream (after it strips off the appropriate protocol headers), then displays the results at specified intervals, either in a ""progress bar"" mode or as raw statistics. Currently, it supports 2 
statistics, both involving entropy: LZW compressability and Ueli Maurer's 
universal statistical test. Maurer's test is a very good and comprehensive 
measure of entropy, but requires a large amount of data. The LZW statistic 
requires much less data.""

    the account  2. old user addresses, recycled into spamtraps several months after the
    user closes the account, scanned for newsletters, unsubscribed

of maintainance to avoid ham getting in there.  Some of my spamtrap data
had a few 1's contributed by ISPs, and I hadn't spent enough time sifting
for legit mail that was slipping through.  So I felt better leaving

"> (Please feel free to forward this message to other possibly-interested

   to Razor, DCC, Pyzor, etc.  Certain RBLs too.  I don't think the
   results for these distributed tests can be trusted in any way,
   shape, or form when running over a public corpus.2. These messages could also be submitted (more than once) to projects
   like SpamAssassin that rely on filtering results submission for GA
   tuning and development.3. Spammers could adopt elements of the good messages to throw off
   filters.  And, of course, there's always progression in technology
   (by both spammers and non-spammers).The second problem could be alleviated somewhat by adding a Nilsimsa
signature (or similar) to the mass-check file (the results format used
by SpamAssassin) and giving the message files unique names (MD5 or
SHA-1 of each file).The third problem doesn't really worry me.These problems (and perhaps others I have not identified) are unique
to spam filtering.  Compression corpuses and other performance-related
corpuses have their own set of problems, of course.In other words, I don't think there's any replacement for having
multiple independent corpuses.  Finding better ways to distribute
testing and collate results seems like a more viable long-term solution
(and I'm glad we're working on exactly that for SpamAssassin).  If
you're going to seriously work on filter development, building a corpus
of 10000-50000 messages (half spam/half non-spam) is not really that
much work.  If you don't get enough spam, creating multi-technique
spamtraps (web, usenet, replying to spam) is pretty easy.  And who
doesn't get thousands of non-spam every week?  ;-)Dan

"[a cheeky letter to the editors of the Economist follows, along with the 
article I was commenting on... Rohit]In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (""The 
Search Goes On"", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most 
subversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which 
merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By 
maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web, 
if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce 
these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from 
Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all 
Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to 
SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle; 
censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in 
China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of 
IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in 
the article.Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic 
costs real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free 
flow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors 
sponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest 
of the Web?To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector 
programming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just 
imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure 
access to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom 
of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most 
of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.On second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting* 
the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...Best,
   Rohit Khare===========================================================The search goes on
China backtracks on banning Googleâ€”up to a pointSep 19th 2002 | BEIJING
 From The Economist print editionIN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine, 
is gougou, meaning â€œdoggyâ€. For the country's fast-growing population of 
Internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving 
an elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked 
access to Google from Internet service providers in Chinaâ€”apparently 
because the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to 
forbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been 
restored.An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More 
sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to 
use Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government. 
Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by 
Google as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for 
Chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users 
posted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move. 
Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet 
providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site 
to far less powerful search engines in China.Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm, 
BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to 
censor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking 
individual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be 
filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key 
words that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this 
week when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on 
Google for Falun Gongâ€”a quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in Chinaâ€”
usually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search 
also rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.

"dear friend , dear friend , i wish to begin by way of introduction . i am williems tomu the first and only surviving son of late marc tomu one of the foremost and rich black farmers in zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe . before the death of my father , he had taken me to johannesburg - south africa , to deposit the sum of us $ 24 million ( tweenty four million united states dollars ) in one of the private security companies , as family valuables . when he realized the looming danger in zimbabwe . this amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in swaziland . this land dispute started when president robert mugabe introduced a new land reform , which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers ( my father included ) . this resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers ( mainly whites ) and the unlawful possession of their properties by mugabe ? s war veterans , under the disguise of fighting for the interest of the country . it is against this background that i fled the country with my family , to the netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum . i have decided to seek foreign assistance , as the netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind , hence this letter to you . all i need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities . my family ? s survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets . there are two options , firstly , you can choose to accept 30 % of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment of the money in your country . we shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when you reply providing me with your telephone fax numbers . i await your reply through this email below willamstomuj @ netscape . net , ) ( williamstomul @ netscape . net ) while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free transaction . i shall furnish you with more details on request . yours truly mr . williems tomu",Phishing Email

u = 5526 & m = 1402 , alternative url : warm weather and strong storage injections have temporarily shifted the focus in the gas market away from a potential supply shortage this winter toward a growing sense that supplies might just prove adequate . the result has been a steady and steep decline in the november nymex price from $ 5 . 63 per mmbtu on october 12 into the $ 4 . 60 s as of october 25 . cash prices have followed suit , falling from the mid - $ 5 . 50 s to the $ 4 . 60 s at the henry hub , and gas is now pricing below residual fuel oil in the gulf coast and especially on the east coast . although gas storage inventories will begin the winter at levels higher than expected , in cera  , s view adequate supply for the winter is not yet assured , and the market remains subject to a quick return to prices well above $ 5 . 00 with the first cold snap . storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) for the week ended october 20 accompanied by broad - based and continuing warm weather have driven the shift in market psychology . last week  , s injection rate was 26 . 5 bcf , or approximately 3 . 8 bcf per day , above the previous five - year average for those seven days and 58 bcf above the 13 bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending october 22 . with warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures expected next week , cera now expects storage to reach a maximum level of 2 , 784 bcf on october 31 - - still an all - time low entering the winter , by 26 bcf ( see table 1 ) . is this inventory level "" enough "" ? not yet . storage inventories this winter under 15 - year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately 780 bcf , 22 bcf above the previous all - time low . this end - of - march minimum implies total withdrawals in the united states this winter of 2 . 0 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) , 128 bcf above last year  , s withdrawals . but holding withdrawals this winter down to 2 . 0 tcf in the face of a return to normal weather - - and the demand rebound of 3 . 0 bcf per day it would bring - - will be difficult . although the beginning of a us supply rebound and growing imports will add approximately 1 . 0 bcf per day to supplies this winter , holding withdrawals down requires both of the following : * industrial markets - - mainly ammonia and methanol producers - - that are now shut down because of high gas prices must remain shut down . these markets represent approximately 0 . 5 bcf per day of demand that could return , should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol . * the nearly 1 . 5 bcf per day of switchable load now burning residual fuel oil must remain off of gas . in cera  , s view , for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis , particularly as power loads increase this winter , it must become apparent that winter demand can be met , the current resid load can return to gas , and storage inventories can be held reasonably near the previous record low . that low , 758 bcf , occurred in march 1996 and was accompanied by a february average price of $ 4 . 41 and a march average of $ 3 . 00 at the henry hub . that spring , however , us productive capability was nearly 4 . 0 bcf per day greater than it is today , winter power generation demand was lower , and there were about 4 . 5 million fewer residential and commercial gas customers in the united states . market fundamentals in cera  , s view still support gas prices above those of resid , which as of this writing is pricing in the $ 4 . 75 - $ 5 . 00 per mmbtu range . warm weather throughout november and into december could reverse this relationship , but a warm october alone is insufficient , and any cold weather within the next few weeks will quickly tighten the slack that has temporarily come into the market . cera  , s price outlook for november - - an average of $ 5 . 50 at the henry hub - - stands for now . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this alert with associated table . cera ' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http : / / www . cera . com / event account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e - mail address , etc . go to : http : / / eprofile . cera . com / cfm / edit / account . cfm this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

"Well, I've used the check-the-modify-time cache trick for files in
many places (not just exmh) so some part of me certainly thinks it
is effective.  However, it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint
state, then aren't we modifying the sequences file for the current
folder on every message read?  Perhaps we look at the sequences file
more than once per message view?  Just idle speculation - we can
stick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are.Someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log.
We could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 -
Tcl has had ""clock seconds"" (like gettimeofday) and ""clock clicks""
(high resolution timer) for some time.  But in 8.3 we've calibrated
clock clicks values to microseconds.  It is still only useful for
relative times, but each call to Exmh_Log could emit the microsecond
delta since the last log record.  Of course, we are measuring all
the overhead of taking the log record, etc.  I'll try it out.>>>Chris Garrigues said:

to present a method for sentence semantics which describes the meaning underlying each simple sentence ; for the lexicon - to present a method for further defining each sense of each verb / predicate in terms of semantic classes ( case-frame - based typology ) . each clause in its underlying structure is reduced to a kernel sentence which is defined as a simple complete active-voice affirmative statement . all texts are reduced to a sequence of kernel sentences the model used is the case grammar matrix model . it presents a clear predicate-argument structure , builds a lexicon which distinguishes various verb senses , and not only describes arguments occurring in the text , but through covert roles , describes implicit arguments . this model is supplemented by the use of conceptual graphs , following sowa ( 1984 ) . each verb type has a generalised conceptual graph to indicate the predicate-argument structure ; and each example in the text contains the canonical graph of that sentence using the verb and nouns as concepts , and case labels as the verb-to - noun relations . the book is organised in the following way . chapter 1 ( pp . 1-54 ) presents the case grammar matrix model in summary form and introduces conceptual graph representation . the next four chapters treat verbs / predicates in four distinguished semantic domains . chapter 2 ( pp . 55-90 ) deals with the basic domain that includes all state , process , and action verbs which use only the agent and object cases . chapter 3 ( pp . 91-126 ) deals with the experiential domain , the domain of sensation , emotion , cognition , and communication . it involves state , process , and action verbs which include an experiencer case in their descriptions . chapter 4 ( pp . 127-42 ) deals with the benefactive domain , the domain of possession and transfer of property , and describes state , process , and action verbs that include a benefactive case . chapter 5 ( pp . 143-82 ) deals with the locative domain , the domain of physical location and movement , and describes state , process , and action verbs that include a locative case . chapter 6 ( pp . 182-220 ) deals with other elements involved in the logical representation of sentences , including tense , aspect , modals , performatives , and negatives , showing how these elements may be included in the logical structure , and ending with a sample sentence parse using case grammar . chapter 7 ( pp . 221-46 ) summarises the analysis of more than 500 examples in chapters 2 through 5 and demonstrates the verbal hierarchy expressed by the twelve cells of the case grammar matrix , organised by verbal domain , verb type , and argument structure . each of the verb types is described together with its conceptual graph , its frequency of occurrence , its subtype , and its defining characteristics . the appendix to the text contains an alphabetical lexicon , listing all of the verbs / predicates in the examples together with their case frames ( pp . 247-52 ) , and a case lexicon , with the verbs sorted by case frame together with references for each verb to the pages where the use of the verb is exemplified ( pp . 253-60 ) . finally , there is a list of references ( pp . 261 - 6 ) , and an index ( pp . 267-71 ) . critical evaluation case grammar ( cg ) works with labelled predicate-argument structure , and thus , in its core , belongs to the dependency grammar paradigm . cg develops a semantic valence system that describes the logical form of a sentence in terms of a central predicate ( usually and typically a lexical verb , but also a predicate adjective , a predicate noun , or a predicate adverb ) and a series of case-labelled arguments ( nominal , adverbial ) required by the meaning of that predicate . so , the type of case considered in the book is ' governed case ' , and in fact , nothing is said about the way cg model would treat ' concordial case ' - cf . , e . g . , blake ( 1994 ) for a detailed discussion of these notions . there is no case concord in english and , hence , the challenges posited by ' concordial case ' are trivially out of the scope of the presented analysis ( which is based exclusively on english data ) . the ambition of the proponents of cg is to develop a semantic interpretation system that is universal across languages , and not tied to the syntax of any particular sentence . on the basis of the presented extensive data analysis it is claimed that the five case labels used in the work ( i . e . agent , object , experiencer , benefactive , and locative ) are necessary and sufficient for the description of all the verbs / predicates in the language ( in this case english ) . the possibility of creating different lists of cases is left open , whereby full translatability is theoretically expected between any consistent list of cases and the one employed in the cg matrix model . both the predicate and its arguments are viewed as concepts ( i . e . the conceptual universe is made up of verbs which describe states or events , and nouns which describe things ) , while the case role labels indicate relations ( which arguments bear to their predicates ) . cg is written in conceptual graph format by placing the concepts ( predicates , arguments ) in boxes and relations ( case roles ) in circles . the arrows in the notation point away from the predicate which is the source of the case relations . an advantage of such an approach is the possibility of defining the default position of the lexical predicate in its case frame , i . e . with respect to the arguments it governs . in the discussed book , a fairly credible ontology of predicators is achieved by hierarchically sorting them according to domain as basic , experiential , benefactive , locative , ( and possibly ) time , and within each domain as state , process , action . further sub-classification of the predicates is based on the number or the position of the arguments . the resulting hierarchical taxonomy is similar to a thesaurus in which all entities are organised into semantic domains . the organisation of the semantic domains is worked out in detail and with precision . the question of case inventory is central to cg , as well as to any theory working with the notion of case . also methodologically , a clear distinction must be made between essential cases , which are required by the meaning of the predicate , and modal case , which are mainly adverbial adjuncts . only essential cases can be used for describing predicates . despite of the lack of universal agreement on the number of case role labels or the way in which they are defined , the author gives a clear step-by step method , accompanied by various concrete tests , how to simplify in practice the case assignment . thus , the labelling is deferred until three basic questions are answered : how many arguments are required by the verb ? what verb type - state , process , or action - is in the structure ? to what semantic domain does the verb belong ? then , the naming of the arguments can be simplified by a set of principles , in combination with a set of tactics for the formation of case frames . within case frames , cases are listed left-to - right according to a subject choice hierarchy ( agent - experiencer - benefactive - object - locative ) which is merely a generalisation covering the unmarked choice . marked choices which violate the subject choice hierarchy are indicated in the lexicon by changing the order of cases in the case frame . possible variations involve "" equatives "" ( in copular constructions ) , regarded in this model as double - object frames in the basic domain , and rank shifts in the subject choice hierarchy . in the lexicon , predicators are classified according to case frames . the case frame is understood as a configuration of one to three cases that are required by the meaning of the verb ( or more generally , the predicate ) . let us remind , however , that , in lexical semantics research , cases are known where the frame would contain up to five slots . a famous example is the verb ' to rent ' ( russian : arendovat ' - cf . apresjan ( 1974 ) p . 134 ) involving the following arguments : ( 1 ) who , ( 2 ) what , ( 3 ) from whom , ( 4 ) for how much , ( 5 ) for how long . special attention is devoted to the possibility of lexicon organisation in terms of derivations intended both to represent linguistic generalisations and to simplify the lexicon ( sections 1 . 13 - 1 . 15 ) . however , the method followed in the work is listing each item separately and supplementing the lexicon with redundancy rules that relate these lexical entries to each other . also , each sense of each predicate is treated as a separate item with its own case frame . in order to set the guidelines for applied cg textual analysis , a concise introduction to the principles of lexical decomposition and to the interpretation of covert case roles is given . lexical decomposition is understood as the process of analysing predicates as consisting of more basic atomic predicates . with some sentences this is unavoidable for determining the actual predicate-argument structure . covert case roles , which are required by the meaning of the predicate , are sometimes ( as in the case of partially covert ( deletable ) case roles ) or always ( as in the case of totally covert ( coreferential and lexicalised ) case roles ) missing in the surface structure . since the cg analysis advocated for in this book maintains the obligatory object hypothesis , covert roles assume greater importance . in all cases where the object role can be sometimes deleted , or can be coreferential with another role , or can be lexicalised into the predicate , a deeper analysis is needed to find the obligatory object . certainly , the lexicalisation of the manifestation of propositional , essential roles is of primary interest in the context of revealing the central predicate in a sentence . the assumption that a predicate , even with covert ( hidden ) case role , has to be defined in terms of its full complement of case roles requires a clear distinction between deletable , coreferential and lexicalised roles . the author offers in this respect not only theoretical background but also concrete tests , procedures and instructions to guide and facilitate practical analysis . two methodological principles are postulated ensuring that all conceptual relations flow from the central verb , and that deletable roles are included in case descriptions . a major asset of the book is , with no doubt , the extensive textual analysis performed with precision , consistency and conformity to the postulated principles and theoretical assumptions . the limits of the approach are realistically recognised by the author , and are stated explicitly in the appropriate places throughout the presentation . the reader will find a well-developed and detailed ontology of predicates , which covers not only verbs but also predicative adjectives , predicative nouns and predicative adverbs . the most important linguistic phenomena are considered in a systematic and easy-to - follow way . this makes the book a valuable guide to a practical sentence analysis , as well as a useful reference material for research purposes and computer applications . references apresjan , jurij d . 1974 : leksicheskaja semantika . sinonimicheskie sredstva jazyka . moskva : nauka blake , barry j . 1994 : case . cambridge textbooks in linguistics . cook , walter a . , s . j . 1989 : case grammar theory . washington , d . c . : georgetown university press . sowa , john f . 1984 : conceptual graphs : information processing in mind and machine . reading , mass . : addison -

When reviewing the Toshiba Pocket PC e740, I spent a lot of time trying to understand its XScale processor. A benchmark provided by Intel seems to indicate that it performs certain operations faster than previous Pocket PCs, but in hands-on use we didn't find any significant difference in performance. I'm still not certain whether I should attribute performance limitation to the operating system (which hasn't been optimized for the new chips), applications (which likewise haven't be optimized), or simply that the new chip isn't that much better than the old StrongARM. But regardless, the e740 is an exceptional Pocket PC and one I don't hesitate to recommend to those looking for a high-powered PDA.

    Damn, this thing is slick.  Someone seems to have done a very complete QA test on it; yesterday I installed it for the first time on an old Celeron box.  Sure, parts of it were slow, but compared to my more modern machine, everything is.  It was good; a beautiful interface that legions of 'sheep' can look at and say ""Cool; I can understand this"" and leave their shackles behind.  :)    I was struck by the massive amount of applications, both KDE and Gnome, intuitively seperated NOT by the Gnome/KDE names, but by their **meanings** instead.  It's obvious that someone spent a lot of time improving the usability and graphics to make it more 'international'; the web browser graphic, for example, has a 'world' icon with a mouse wrapped around it. Office-apps have familiar pens, paper, and/or calculators involved.    This is a Linux that I can plop down in front of almost anyone, and they can figure it out.    At some point I'd miss the character of KDE/Gnome, and I'll probably 'hotrod' the graphics setup with my own themes, etc.  But for the wide release, this one's IT.  If you get a chance, try this; I think you'll be surprisingly pleased.

OPRAH, NIGHTLINE, MARIA SHRIVER, 48 HOURS, 20/20, 
PLAYBOY, KIPLINGERS and more have all interviewed this 
FAMOUS Private Investigator, seeking to find how he made 
his fortune.  Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using 
them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a 
Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very 
substantial income.Hereï¿½s the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against 
another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.
BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these 
SHOCKING FACTS:a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment
b) The court does not require the loser to pay you. 
c) The court will not help you to collect it. 
d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling 
you how to collect the judgment. All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They 
must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank 
accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER 
has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that 
BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an 
expense instead of an asset!  WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in 
files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the 
United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of 
uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 
5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting 
other peopleï¿½s judgments?  Thatï¿½s what we want to tell you.  
Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a 
process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper 
into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the 
techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time 
making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time 
associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per 
year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable 
organizations.Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing 
over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, 
new judgments become available every day.  The work is
ALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. 
This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start 
something ï¿½on the sideï¿½ that will offer a solid income in the future. 
It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to 
spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT 
A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.  
The more effort the bigger the reward.  You choose how much you 
want to make!If you've ever dreamed the American Dream financial freedom 
this may very well be the opportunity youï¿½ve been looking for.  
This business can also protect you from corporate downsizing. 
It might also be your ticket to freedom from others telling you what
to do. This business lets you control your destiny! You donï¿½t need 
to be a rocket scientist either! Our training has made this happen for 
many others already. Make it happen for you too!Take the first step and talk it over with one of our trained 
counselors by calling 1-720-733-7315.  Let them answer your 
questions so that youï¿½ll know if itï¿½s right for you.  There is no cost 
or obligation on your part except the cost of a phone call.  Join a small number of people who are reaping the BIG 
REWARDS, by calling us at 1-720-733-7315 today!",Phishing Email

"Hi folks,
I maintain a colocated server on behalf of a small group of individuals,
and am looking at backup solutions. Is it possible to get some sort of low-
end internal tape / other solution that could be used to back up approx. 40
Gigs of data or am I just dreaming? My ISP does offer backups at extra cost
but the only problem with that is, well, the extra cost.What I was hoping to do was to install some kind of internal tape device,
then swap tapes round every month, so I had an onsite backup of say the
last 24 hours and an offsite backup of the last month. Is this feasible?
I'm beginning to think it isn't. External devices are not an option as part
of the charge for colocation is rackspace.Thanks,
Ciaran.--

				P2P getting down to some serious work
      	
 
    
	 By John Fontana
    Network World, 08/19/02
	
 Just a few years removed from the mayhem of music swapping that clogged corporate networks, peer-to-peer technology is growing up and rediscovering its roots as a legitimate concept for distributed computing in corporate environments and the Internet.The turnaround is distinct since P2P has distanced itself from the darling days of Napster and has been transplanted onto the architectural drawing boards of Internet and corporate network gurus.For network executives, the about-face is showing up in such discrete places as wireless routing, identity management, Web services and grid computing. P2P has proved its worth - albeit with a few warts - in enterprise collaboration and content management applications, but its brightest future may be in the plumbing of corporate distributed computing.
 But even as P2P fades into the background, questions around security, standards and quality of service still have to be answered before P2P can flourish, experts say.
The P2P evolutionRegardless, P2P's evolution has hit its next stage. ""Peer-to-peer is an architecture and one that will play a substantial role in distributed computing as endpoints in the network gain more power,"" says Jamie Lewis, CEO and research chair of Burton Group. He says that will be particularly important for Web services as peers share processes and data. ""P2P will become a fundamental part of how distributed computing evolves across the Internet and how enterprises build distributed systems internally."" Lewis says the Internet today is very rudimentary with its basic protocols for basic operations. ""Now we're seriously talking about the network becoming the computer, incorporating some P2P connections and being able to share processes and power, which is what grid computing provides.""Observers say it's a renaissance.""P2P's reverting to an architecture that can be applied to solve problems that by their very nature are distributed,"" says Neil Macehiter, senior consultant for Ovum, a research and consulting firm. ""But the question is can this model provide benefits for business use.""Macehiter says it can, but he cautions that security, such as removing blocks to P2P traffic on corporate firewalls, is still a major inhibitor to acceptance. ""But you can imagine something like grid extending to share application logic instead of just being a data grid or a storage grid. When you look at Web services sharing business logic in the enterprise, you see the intersection with grid and P2P,"" he says.
Working togetherTo underscore P2P's evolution, the Global Grid Forum (GGF), a 2-year-old group founded by academics and researches, merged in April with the P2P Working Group, originally founded by Intel. The groups are attempting to marry the GGF's work on harnessing servers on a grid with P2P's ability to connect desktops.""We're now trying to figure out how grid and P2P play nice together, and capture that power for use in enterprise computing,"" says Andrew Chien, co-director of the GGF's peer-to-peer area and CTO of Entropia, a provider of desktop grid applications.Late last month, the merged group began evaluating how P2P relates to the Open Grid Services Architecture, an effort to standardize grid computing. Chien says his group is exploring how P2P protocols for such things as registration, resource discovery and coordination of data transfer support a common grid infrastructure.And P2P's roots are reaching into other areas. It is an integral part of mobile wireless technology set for release this fall by MeshNetworks. The company's MeshLAN software extends the range of 802.11 wireless networks by making every wireless peer an endpoint in an ad-hoc P2P network and also a router/repeater to channel traffic to other peers.Using a patented multihopping technology, peers that are out of range of wireless access points or peers they wish to communicate with can hop through other peers to reach their destination, including corporate LANs. It not only increases the wireless range, it preserves throughput, which is up to 6 megabits. The technology also is mobile, letting hopping take place from nodes traveling in vehicles up to 250 mph.""P2P allows us to do the hopping, and our algorithms allow the traffic to pick the most efficient path to travel,"" says Rick Rotondo, vice president of disruptive technologies for MeshNetworks. ""The beauty of a P2P network is that it is self-forming and self-healing.""And the technology is mature.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which created the Internet, spent $150 million developing the peer technology for use in forming instant networks among soldiers on a battlefield. MeshNetworks licensed it from DARPA has spent an additional $27 million to create a commercial product.P2P also is key to the PingID Project to create an identity management system similar to work under way by Microsoft and the Liberty Alliance Project, which are not using P2P. ""Ideally, you need a way to create, manage and exchange digital identity information with no one in the middle of the transaction,"" says Andre Duran, founder of the project. He says that's P2P, but it's just one part of the equation. ""Your ID is a virtual private vault with different drawers,"" Duran says. ""One drawer may be on your PC, one may be with a service provider, and you need a client to manage all that. We are building the infrastructure to support that.""Ping ID is working on server and client software that acts like a mini-Web server and maintains a repository of user's identity information. Users have the option of exchanging IDs directly through P2P or using client/server technology to authorize a third party to dispense their identity data. ""P2P provides a level of control that other architectures don't,"" Duran says. ""It comes down to the fact that some applications are more efficient with P2P.""That is the concept that is driving P2P into so many different areas of computing.""P2P has evolved from something highly disruptive to something complementary to intranets, extranets, mobile users and all the Web integration,"" says Greg Bolcer, CTO of Endeavors Technology, which develops a P2P collaboration software called Magi.And although P2P is still settling into this new role, it's obvious that its reputation as a music-swapping corporate scourge are now well behind it.

thing. Which, presumably involves sticking your outgoing going message
in the right queue. Then you need your postfix SMTP client to
authenticate with your postfix SMTP server. Are you using SASL? If so,
I remember seeing documentation on how to configure the postfix SMTP

Dear Reader,
Personal lasers come in shapes, sizes, and prices to suit almost 
any user. A low-end desktop laser printer can cost as little as 
$199 or as much as $500, but most hover around $300 and strike a 
good balance between speed, quality, and features. The less expensive 
models will suit students or home users who need to print letters 
or homework assignments, as well as perform other simple tasks. 
In pricier models, vendors typically add more RAM, higher-capacity 
paper trays, duplexing capabilities, and networking options for 
corporate and small-business users. Check out a few of our favorites below and find the laser printer
with the right price and features for you!Brother HL-1440

"a better investment than the stock market . all our mailings are sent complying to the proposed h . r . 3113 unsolicited commercial electronic mail act of 2000 . please see the bottom of this message for further information and removal instructions . parents of 15 - year old - find $ 71 , 000 cash hidden in his closet ! does this headline look familiar ? of course it does . you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( usa ) . and reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods - new zealand ) . his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 - year - old sons closet . nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . five - dollar bills , twenties , fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber - banded in labelled piles . "" my first thought was that he had robbed a bank "" , says the 41 - year - old woman , "" there was over $ 71 , 000 dollars in that bag - - that ' s more than my husband earns in a year "" . the woman immediately called her husband at the car - dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via e - mail , a type of "" report "" to e - mail addresses that he obtained off the internet . everyday after school for the past 2 months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . "" i just got the e - mail one day and i figured what the heck , i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out "" , says the clever 15 - year - old . the e - mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $ 5 dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five - dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5 - address list . "" i get junk e - mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work "" , the boy continues . within the first few days of sending out the e - mail , the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video - game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ 5 bills . "" about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it . there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . i thought i was in trouble or something ( laughs ) "" . he goes on , "" i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all "" . over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the e - mail . "" the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework "" . he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ 5 bills for twenties , fifties and hundreds . "" i didn ' t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack . i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money ] and he was outside waiting for me . one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it , but i just rode to the next bank down the street ( laughs ) . "" surprisingly , the boy did not have any reason to be afraid . the reporting news team examined and investigated the so - called "" chain - letter "" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain - letter at all . in fact , it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws , title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 , or title 18 , section 3005 in the us code , also in the code of federal regulations , volume 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . every five - dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , "" please send me report number xyx "" . this simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( a report on how - to ) for a five - dollar fee . [ this is the end of the media release . if you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ 71 , 000 - please continue reading . what appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - you can use it too - just follow the simple instructions ] . be financially free like others within a year ! ! ! before you say "" bull "" , please read the following . this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are "" absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some megabucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost "" . due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this program has attained , it is currently working better than ever . note * follow the directons below , i had best results the second time when i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions . in order for all of us to be successful , many , many emails must be sent so that the returns are many . i have been extremely successful using the following company . they send out the offers , and all i do is accept money for reports , then i send back to the people as soon as possible . this is what one had to say : "" thanks to this profitable opportunity . i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it . i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received total $ 610 , 470 . 00 in 21 weeks , with money still coming in "" . pam hedland , fort lee , new jersey . here is another testimonial : "" this program has been around for a long time but i never believed in it . but one day when i received this again in the mail i decided to gamble my $ 25 on it . i followed the simple instructions and walaa . . . . . 3 weeks later the money started to come in . first month i only made $ 240 . 00 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of $ 290 , 000 . 00 . so far , in the past 8 months by re - entering the program , i have made over $ 710 , 000 . 00 and i am playing it again . the key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change anything . "" more testimonials later but first , print this now for your future reference + + + + order all 5 reports shown on the list below + + + for each report , send $ 5 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering and your e - mail address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems . when you place your order , make sure you order each of the 5 reports . you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer . within a few days you will receive , vie e - mail , each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer . important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in step "" 1 through 6 "" or you will loose out on majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter , it will not work ! ! ! people have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money . but it does not work this way . believe us , we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened . so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed . because if you do , it will not work for you . remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! ! 1 . . . . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this advertisement and remove the name & address of the person in report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune . 2 . . . . move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5 . 3 . . . . move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4 . 4 . . . . move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3 . 5 . . . . move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2 6 . . . . insert your name & address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name & address accurately ! * * * * take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do not make any other changes . save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going : method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receive only a 0 . 2 % response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0 . 2 % . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e - mails instead of only 5 , 000 each ) . continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that equals 100 people responded and ordered report # 2 . those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 . those 1000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 5 million e - mails sent out . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 . that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half million ) . your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . . . . grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00 numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . = order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper or aluminum foil . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 : the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net order report # 1 from : r . r . po box 18048 chicago , il 60618 report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk e - mail on the net order report # 2 from : gm boland 353 jonestown rd . suite 125 winston salem , nc 27104 report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net order report # 3 from : r . chernick po box 771661 c . s . florida 33077 report # 4 : how to become a millionaire utilizing mlm & the net order report # 4 from : m . eiseman po box 451971 sunrise , florida 33345 - 1971 report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free order report # 5 from : l . samon po box 31 castletown isle of man im 99 5 xp $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : + + + if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do . = orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . + + + once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business ! ! ! following is a note from the originator of this program : you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with no risk and just a little bit of effort . you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 thru # 5 as instructed above . one of the people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on every one of them . remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to you now ! + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + more testimonials + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + "" my name is mitchell . my wife , jody and i live in chicago . i am an accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good money . when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving "" junk mail "" . i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i "" knew "" it wouldn ' t work . jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old "" i told you so "" on her when the thing didn ' t work . well , the laugh was on me ! within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses . within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147 , 200 . 00 . . . . all cash ! i was shocked . i have joined jody in her "" hobby "" . mitchell wolf , chicago , illinois "" not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn ' t get enough orders to at least get my money back "" . "" i was surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with orders . i made $ 319 , 210 . 00 in the first 12 weeks . the nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live . there simply isn ' t a better investment with a faster return and so big "" . dan sondstrom , alberta , canada "" i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e - mailed again by someone else . . . . . . 11 months passed then it luckily came again . . . . . . i did not delete this one ! i made more than $ 490 , 000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks "" . susan de suza , new york , n . y if you have any questions of the legality of this program , contact the office of associate director for marketing practices , federal trade commission , bureau of consumer protection , washington , d . c . this email was sent to you via saf - e mail systems . your email address was automatically inserted into the to and from addresses to eliminate undeliverables which waste bandwidth and cause internet congestion . your email or webserver is not being used for the sending of this mail . no - one else is receiving emails from your address . you may utilize the removal link below if you do not wish to receive this mailing . http : / / www . webtransit . net / remove . html",Phishing Email

"Craig, For the most part, 99% times 99% users agree on what is spam. This is the
nature of the spam problem. Now if you were to use a ""personal trust""
system, you'd have a huge personal trust group that would include 99% of
the userbase. This means 99% times you'd be coming to the same conclusion,
only after burning several orders of magnitude more CPU cycles. That would
be stupid. Also, it would take several orders of magnitude longer to
bootstrap and reach effectiveness. Sub-optimal in the extreme.As regards to the problems with the ""gray"" areas you mentioned, servers
recognize such content, and razor-agents can use this information to make
individual determination. Not to mention, users can set a local confidence

"Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):> What is the GPL all about then?(1) I'm sure you are not _actually_ under the delusion that everything
on a typical Linux distribution issued subject to the terms of the GNU
GPL.  For one thing, it seems difficult to imagine you _not_ being aware
that XFree86 is under the X/MIT licence, that Perl is under the Perl
Artistic Licence, that Apache is under the Apache licence, and that
numerous BSD utilities are under the BSD licence.Furthermore, xv, Acrobat Reader, pine, pico, Netscape Communicator, and
a whole slew of other applications typically included aren't under any
open source licence at all, but rather are proprietary.(2) You seem, in any event, to be under a misconception as to what the
GPL provides, as to code under its umbrella.  It says (in part) that
_if_ you have lawfully received a copy of covered binary code, then you
may insist on one of certain forms of access to the matching source
code.  Please note that it does _not_ guarantee you any rights
whatsoever if nobody's decided to give you a lawful copy.> But *_surely_* they cannot BSD Linux? It's not theirs to BSD!Again, you seem to be under a misconception.  If you check, I'm quite
confident you'll see that SuSE are in full compliance with GPL v. 2's
source-code access provisions concerning GPLed code included in their
distribution.  And no, nobody has the legal right to alter licence terms
to someone else's copyrighted property.  But you have not cited any
reasons to believe that SuSE have done any of those things.
 
> Fine - nobody can oblige SuSE to do anything other than put up the ftp
> version, but surely they can't prevent a CD owner from burning a copy
> and giving it to me?See below.  You and the CD owner would be committing copyright violation.
SuSE Linux AG are rather unlikely to knock down your door and haul you
down to a judge, if that's what you're asking.> Nobody can oblige them to give away anything other than ftp - I'm not
> asking for that. I'm asking for somebody who has Linux (GPL'ed) to
> burn a copy for me and give it to me in exchange for a reasonable
> consideration (say, the price of the CDs and a bottle of Frascati or a
> couple of pints?).You appear confused between Linux the kernel (which is a copyrighted
work to which source code access is guaranteed under the GNU GPL if
you've received a lawful copy of a binary version) and the rather
imprecise concept of a ""Linux distribution"", which is a number of works
under diverse licence terms collected onto some media.In the case of SuSE's boxed sets -- which are NOT lawful to duplicate
and redistribute in their entirety -- at least a couple of the
applications on them (YaST, YaST2, and the installer program) are
proprietary copyrighted works of SuSE Linux AG.  In the general case,
duplicating and redistributing CD-ROMs containing those works is
copyright infringement.  Illegal.  No amount of hand-waving about the
GNU GPL is going to change that.(SuSE permit people to duplicate and redistribute the ""evaluation"" and
""live-eval"" CD editions, despite that fact, as long as it is not ""for
value"".)If you want to have a SuSE boxed set to install from, buy one.> What does the GPL mean now?Suggestion:  Read it.  I would guess you've not yet done so.-- 
Cheers,                                             Live Faust, die Jung.

TONY BLAIR's special relationship with George W. Bush is under
considerable strain. Not only do the two disagree on Yassir Arafat's
tenure as leader of the Palestinian Authority, but Blair has started
telling disparaging anecdotes about the President.Baroness Williams of Crosby recalled a story told to her by 'my good
friend Tony Blair' recently in Brighton. Blair, Bush and Jacques
Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular, the decline of
the French economy. 'The problem with the French,' Bush confided in
Blair, 'is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.'

"re : ter meulen 's review ter meulen , alice g . b . , ( 1997 ) representing time in natural language , the dynamic interpretation of tense and aspect , mit press , cambridge mass . , 160 pages , isbn 0-262 - 70066 - 2 , $ 12 . 50 ( paperback ) . reviewed by anne reboul , loria-cnrs , france . anne . reboul @ loria . fr 0 . introduction ter meulen 's book is a good introduction to the work which she has been doing during the past few years on both the representation of eventualities and temporal reasoning . the book combines her approach 's desire not to lose information previously given in discourse with semantic principles which are squarely based on situation semantics . this allows her to introduce dynamic aspect trees ( dats ) , which can loosely be described as temporal inference pumps . ter meulen points out that , though common sense reasoning plays an important role in temporal reasoning , it is not her aim to deal with it . finally the present paperback edition of the book incorporates an appendix giving some exercises on dat construction and a short account of the resemblance and difference between drt and dats . 1 . 0 book summary preface ter meulen aims to account for the linguistic and informational balance between static and dynamic information , proposing abstract semantic principles relative to tense and aspect and using tools derived from situation semantics . 1 . introduction language describes the world as being composed of two main types of temporal objects : events which introduce changes and states which do not . this linguistic capacity is accompanied by an inferential ability in interpretation of what is or is not the case when . ter meulen deals only with the simple past , the perfect , the progressive and some uses of the present , that is with tenses which indicate in which order events occur , through weak constraints on the temporal relations between events . the difference between the simple past and the perfect is aspectual , as is obvious when they are examined in the light of the difference between events and states : the simple past describes events in a context-dependent way while the perfect only gives stative information . aspect can be seen as imposing control on the flow of information and here ter meulen introduces three main universal aspectual classes , holes , filters and plugs which are closely related , respectively , to vendler 's classical ontological classes of activities ( "" john ran for half an hour "" ) , accomplishments ( "" john built a house "" ) and achievements ( "" john won the race "" ) . ter meulen introduces the notion of situated reasoning about time : according to her , there is a temporal vantage point in a text from which reasoning about the text can proceed . this is the first ( descriptive ) factor . the second ( aspectual ) factor is the source of information , while the third factor is perspective information . new temporal information is processed against a context ( the given ) which incorporates at least the lexicon and syntax of the language , situated and logical inference rules , other semantic constraints ( presuppositions ) , the available information and the elements of the situation of use . 2 . the aspectual verbs the aspectual verbs describe the internal structure of events and are , in english , "" start "" , "" begin "" , "" commence "" , "" initiate "" , "" resume "" ( for event beginnings ) , "" continue "" , "" keep "" ( for event middles ) and "" end "" , "" finish "" , "" terminate "" , "" halt "" , "" cease "" , "" complete "" ( for event endings ) . aspectual verbs describing the middle or the end of an event carry anaphoric presupposition ( assumptions about the previous existence not of an event , but of this event ) . aspectual verbs describing the onset of an event semantically have an indefinite and existential character . verbs describing the middle of an event are quantificational verbs and holes . verbs describing the ending of events may be filters or plugs depending on whether they can be finished ( plugs ) or ended ( holes ) . there are pairs of aspectual verbs linked by a semantic contrary relation , such as "" start / finish "" , "" stop / resume "" , "" resume / finish "" , "" keep / end "" , "" continue / end "" . in dat 's , events are complex objects , constituted of individuals , their relations and a positive or negative polarity . events can be classified in similarity classes or types based on their parts . a type consists in a relation , objects and a positive or negative polarity , indicating whether the relation holds or does not hold between the objects . types can also include parameters or indeterminate objects and can be used for any constituent apart from polarities . a given situation supports the type if it matches with its constituents . for types including parameters ( parametric types ) , support depends on the existence in the situation of some objects corresponding to the parameter and satisfying both the relation and the polarity . aspectual verbs can also be described in terms of their monotonicity : if inferences , for a given aspectual verbs , are valid from smaller parts to larger parts , the verb is monotone increasing , while if inferences are valid from larger parts to smaller parts , the verbs are monotone decreasing . ter meulen then proposes the aspectual cube , that is a cube allowing the representation of the relations between aspectual verbs as well as of their monotonicity properties . each vortex in the cube has two vertical arrows of which the first represents the dynamic plugs ( upward arrow ) / static holes ( downward arrow ) while the second represents the increasing ( upward arrow ) or decreasing ( downward arrow ) monotonicity . the cube visualizes the dynamic transitions beginning with + start ; and stopping with "" end "" or "" finish "" . its bottom corresponds to stative holes , while its top corresponds to dynamic plugs , allowing four combinations of arrows in english : dynamic plugs + increasing monotonicity , dynamic plugs + decreasing monotonicity , stative holes + increasing monotonicity , stative holes + descreasing monotonicity . external negation flips the left arrow changing the dynamicity , while internal negation flips the right arrow . finally , there is an arrow kinematics , whereby the combinations of arrow given above gives a dynamic or stative aspect , this being always determined by the right arrow ( i . e . the value of the combination is always the value of the right arrow ( upward = plug ; downward = hole ) . 3 . dynamic aspect trees ( dats ) dats are a way of graphically representing information about events in directed graphs where nodes , labeled with descriptive information , can be either holes or plugs . each dat has a unique source node ( a plug ) , which is the rightmost terminal node , corresponding to the utterance event and determining the perspective . any information in the past tense has preceded the source and is represented by nodes on a branch to the left of it . present information include the source . thus left-to - right order represents the flow of time while downward arrows represent temporal inclusion . dats are used for temporal reasoning about the past ( though they do not allow modalities and counterfactuals ) . there is also in a dat a single root node , dominating all the other nodes , including the source , and representing the entire episode described . there is also a current node , which is the last constructed one and which can opened ( hole ) or closed ( plug ) , this property determining how the next information will be processed . if the current node is a plug , the new information will be represented as a new node descending from one of the current node 's parent nodes , usually the lowest compatible parent node . simple past tense clauses introduce new nodes , while states , quantificational relations , perfect clauses with "" have "" and progressive clauses are introduced as stickers on the current node , if it is a plug , or on the next node , if it is a hole . stickers are portable and can be transmitted to new nodes when the dat grows . introducing a new node independent of the current one indicates a change in perspective . a path connecting a set of labeled nodes to the root is a chronoscope and the current chronoscope is the one containing the current node . compatibility relations ( which are symmetric , reflexive and transitive ) are determined both lexically and through the entailment relations between types on the same chronoscope . the notion of chronoscope is one of the main device of temporal reasoning in dats , allowing for persistence , i . e . the preservation of information . however , temporal reasoning depends on the current node , the search for a conclusion starting at the current node . dats are structured semantic objects rather than linguistic expressions and , as such they follow semantic rules . they are interpreted in event structures into which they are embedded and which allow temporal reasoning if they obey semantic constraints . interpretability for a text depends on the possibility of constructing a dat which can be embedded in an event structure obeying these constraints . an embedded dat describes an episode if the event structure in which it is embedded provides values for it . a text is true if the episode described in the dat is part of the world . 4 . states , generic information and constraints stative information are always represented as stickers on nodes in dats , but some states are more permanent than others , this difference being represented as portability conditions in perspective shifts . there are thus rules for downward portability conditions of stickers and for portability conditions for accommodation . portability conditions differ for perfect states and for progressive states . generic stative information is also represented by stickers and can be imported upward depending on whether the property is predicated under default to the members of a given category or on whether it is predicated of the category itself rather than of its members and on whether it appears in conditionals or under temporal quantification . 5 . perspectives a dat gives a certain perspective on the episode it describes and the same episode may be described in different dats , each giving a different perspective on it . this means that dats on the same episode can lead to different conclusions . changes of perspective depend on the rule used for the updating : hole or sticker rules do not change the perspective , plug or filler rules do . in other words , changes of chronoscope correspond to changes of perspective and depend on the status of the current node . there is , however , more to perspective than just creating a new chronoscope when updating the dat : the other possibility goes through perspective refinement . perspective refinement corresponds to the unplugging of a plug which turns it into a hole , allowing the addition of new information under it . the notion of perspective is strongly dependent on the compatibility of information or , more generally , on coherence and it is one of the merits of dat to allow for a more precise content to the rather slippery notion of coherence , relying on the rules for dat construction and the notion of chronoscope . perspective refinements usually correspond to flashbacks and consist of three operations : unplugging nodes in old chronoscopes , resetting the current node to an old one and making the existing nodes and the new nodes just added independent though they are dominated by the same ancestor . ter meulen proposes a tentative definition of such a flashback process . she notes that perspective allows perspective binding of np anaphora and proposes a perspective constraint to deal with it . finally ter meulen outlines the possibility of three-dimensional dats , the third dimension allowing for the representation of independent structures of nodes , though communality of the root is preserved . such three dimensional dats would be called scenarios though each part of such dats with a unique source would still describe an episode . parts of scenarios which incorporates different simultaneous episodes are scenes . 6 . a fragment of english in this chapter , ter meulen gives a syntactic and semantic account of a fragment of english , as "" a laboratory environment for the theory of interpretation "" ( 93 ) , as well as a recapitulation of the rules for dat construction and updating . 7 . epilogue dats allow for the simultaneous encoding of three types of information : aspectual control of information through the open / closed property of nodes , temporal part / whole relations between events , and descriptive information through the types labeling the nodes . dats are compatible with aristotelian realism as defined by barwise and perry , that is , with the view that the structure of information depends on the natural world . a distinction should be made , according to ter meulen between interpreting an utterance to extract the information it contains and evaluating the truth-value of that information . appendix in this appendix which has been added in the paperback edition , ter meulen has provided exercises on dat construction as well as a comparison between drt and dats . i will only comment on that second part of the appendix . as ter meulen notes , dats stems partly from drt . nevertheless and though dat logic is not developed enough to allow for a complete comparison , there are quite a few differences between them : dats account for inference from simple past to past perfect or progressive , for portability conditions of stative information in chronoscopes and for aspectual verbs , which drt does not ; drt accounts for temporal adverbials and for temporal interpretation of subordinate clauses , which dats do not ; dats substitute the notion of current chronoscope to the notion of temporal reference point used in drt . finally dats characterize valid logic inference as depending crucially from the current node , while drt characterizes valid logic inference classically , as logical consequence . 1 . 1 . critical evaluation ter meulen 's book is highly stimulating , original and interesting . it must be read by anyone interested in time , tense and aspect . all the criticisms which can be leveled against it come from one reason : the fact that the book is much too short . this means that though it is clear enough , it is rather difficult to read . it is also quite frustrating in that , for instance , though ter meulen does explain how to construct dats ( in chapter 3 ) and gives detailed rules , there is not enough step by step examples of dats in the book ( as for example , there was in kamp and reyle 1993 ) . in much the same way , one would have liked to have a much more detailed comparison with alternative accounts , such as drt , the parsonian account of events or , more generally , aktionsart . the appendix , which has been added in the paperback edition ( 1997 ) and which did not exist in the first hardback edition ( 1995 ) , is not really enough to satisfy both of these complaints . ter meulen 's book hints about a relation between reference to objects and reference to time ( the indefiniteness of the argument nps of a given verb may influence the interpretation of the clause , and , notably , aspect ) . all of these hints are very interesting and , again , a longer book might have given the author more scope to develop those intuitions . thus one can only hope that this interesting book will be followed by a bigger one , in which dat logic could be developed more fully , contrasted with alternative approaches and where ter meulen could describe more precisely her suggestions regarding perspective and the interaction between the semantic aspect in dats and the commonsense reasoning whose necessity she acknowledges but which she does not deal with in her book . finally , ter meulen 's book was published at the same time as pustejovsky 's work on the lexicon , thus she does n't make use of pustejovsky 's system . it would be nice to know if an intersection between these approaches can be made . references kamp , h . & reyle , u .

"URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/04.html#history_of_the_tilde
Date: 2002-10-04T00:27:41-05:00So I was researching the history of the tilde, because D told me that her 
company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any URL with a 
tilde in it. Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with 
remarkable accuracy a personal site, and apparently her employer believes that 
reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time. Which, to be 
honest, is probably accurate, given the nature of her work. But never mind 
that. I don't want to talk about corporate politics. I want to talk about the 
tilde. Every command-line-loving geek will tell you that ~ stands for â€œhome 
directoryâ€, and cd ~ will take you to your home directory. (cd ~username 
will take you to someone else's, except on Mac OS X, where it will take you to 
their Public file sharing directory.) It is from this heritage that we can 
trace the present-day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal 
pages, since one single system-wide configuration allowed individual users to 
have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. Or, more 
commonly now that Apache has taken over the world, in their public_html 
subdirectory, except on Mac OS X, where if you turn on web sharing and point 
your browser to http://localhost/~username/, you're actually being served files 
from that user's Sites directory within their home directory. But I don't want to talk about Mac OS X. I want to talk about the tilde. As with so many other things, I find that Jukka Korpela[1] is the expert in 
this field. Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass[2], a word which Google (
old habits die hard[3]) feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene 
Wallingford, which, like Jukka's home page, can not be referenced without a 
tilde. In fact, Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be 
used in URLs[4], a treatise which, I feel obliged to point out, contains a 
tilde in its URL. Clearly, the tilde is underappreciated. Digging further, we find this post of Jukka's from 1998[5], in which we learn 
that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all, but rather an odd 
character called the overline. Presumably to balance out the underline, if 
indeed those sorts of things require balance. There is balance in the universe, 
to be sure, but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard. No matter. 
The tilde was the tilde so that Spanish-typing types could type the Ã± 
(now referenced in HTML as the named entity Ã±), but somewhere along 
the line, it morphed into a general-purpose character with all sorts of geeky 
uses. Digging even further, it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for 
#[6], then an alternate for ^, and its life as an overline replacement came 
even later. Jukka confirms this[7] and adds a timeline: 1963 for #, 1964 for ^, 
1966 for overline. Then June 30, 1966, the watershed moment in an X3 committee 
meeting, when it was proposed â€œas exclusively a tilde in USA to appease 
SHAREâ€. I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means, or 
what this committee meeting was about. The next reference isn't until 1991, 
when the tilde was officially added to ISO-646[8]. And now, down the rabbit hole we go. Scouring Usenet (which the kids of 
yesterday called â€œDeja Newsâ€, and kids today call â€œGoogle 
Groupsâ€), we find a reprint of a 1991 William Safire (yes, _that_ William 
Safire) article On Language[9], in which we learn that ~ is officially 
pronounced â€œsquiggleâ€. This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary
[10] to this very day. I'm not sure this is useful, but I just thought it was 
cool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various 
ASCII characters. As early as August 1990, tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem
[11]. In July 1989, Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde[12]. In February 1988, an editor's note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that 
Fidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde[13]. As early as January 1987, less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF[14]. As early as July 1986, troff supported the tilde[15]. In November 1985, a mod.sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements 
(history,tilde,job control)[16]. As early as January 1984, tilde was included on the DEC keyboard[17] and listed 
in the APL-11 character set[18]. In April 1983, tilde was causing bugs in vi[19] (actually due to underlying 
bugs in csh). In December 1982, ~ is officially pronounced â€œtildeâ€[20], prompting 
this typographical pun[21]. And that's the earliest reference I can find. So where does that leave us? Unsatisfied, no doubt. There is history here, but 
there are gaps. What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966? How did the 
tilde rise to prominence in the 1980s? When did it become a synonym for 
â€œhome directoryâ€? When did it migrate into the world of web servers 
to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web 
sites? I don't know, and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing 
my research, a failing for which I apologize profusely. Goodnight, goodnight. 
May you dream of tildes, stars, and whorls.[1]  http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/

The flexi-PCB connecting the halves is probably only good for 100,000 flexes too.

is such a handy accessible proxy signing method and Dragon Naturally

	Seriously, the nifty Palm thing where you enter your password

good method.  Keyed steganography (<---bad term! sorry) is it until I

to sell you a lappad that gets you to 10h on a P4m...maybe a P4, who's to

(Besides which, a brown cowpie-colored Dell 8200 with a 
GeForce4Go400-32 is ca. $1550, before you buy car adapters 
and firewire drives.  Popular in OpenGL law school.)Revamping the Sony C1 every year strikes me as a cruel joke though,
and I don't know any tricks for using 1400x2800 virtual screens on
the lovely NEC LaVie MX and Versa Daylite (FLCDs, 1 yr old) or

"wolfram and schilling - estes : american english wolfram , walt and schilling - estes , natalie . ( 1998 ) . american english . oxford , u . k . : blackwell . isbn 0-631 - 20846 - 5 ( hardcover ) . rrp : us $ 59 . 95 ( hardcover ) 16 . 99 / us $ 29 . 95 the rich phonology of american "" accents "" is appreciated and instantly identifiable by non - american speakers of english worldwide , through television , radio and now ( perhaps ) through the internet . however , the perceived homogeneity of the american way of speaking as something uniquely "" american "" by these speakers of english , lies in stark contrast to the diversity of american english which is the domestic reality . in this exciting revision of wolfram 's classic "" dialects and american english "" , wolfram and schilling - estes not only attempt to provide a detailed account of the geographical and sociocultural distribution of certain kinds of american english , through distinct dialects , grammar , and usage , but also attempt to dispel a number of urban ( and not-so - urban ) myths common among native american english speakers . the book begins by contrasting the popular definition of "" dialects "" and their relative social desirability ( or otherwise ) , as perceived by native speakers who often feel they do not speak a dialect , with technical definitions from linguistics in the context of the so-called "" desirability-deficit "" debate . the work of schilling - estes in documenting the ocracoke english of north carolina , in particular , places her in a unique position to comment on language variation and the social issues involved in linguistic minorities ( especially in attempting to dispel myths regarding social desirability and dialects ) . the second chapter contrasts linguistic and sociohistorical explanations of the processes by which different dialects arise in languages , and more generally , why languages change over time . whilst the latter explanation sees languages and dialects as arising from the interaction of social and historical conditions , such as migration , settlement , and language contact , the former view sees languages as dynamical systems which have an inherent capacity and impetus to change , which arises from their structure . although some linguists are not directly concerned with sociohistorical factors in language change , the authors successfully integrate both viewpoints by examining general processes such as grammaticalization in the context of specific examples ( such as the new york city vernacular ) . however , those interested solely in a comprehensive review of distinctive american grammar , independent of social factors , should look elsewhere - this book is not a taxonomic ( and nor should it be ) . however , the third chapter which discusses levels of dialect should be useful for understanding the strata of dialects in contemporary american speech . the fourth chapter provides a historical overview of the development of american dialects , from elizabethan influences and pre-revolutionary dialects , to the rise of the west coast and twentieth century accents . this chapter successfully uses geographical diagrams and maps not only to demonstrate localised changes in distinctive dialect features ( such as r-lessness and r-fulness ) that have occurred throughout the history of the united states , but also to demonstrate the flow and influence of dialects during settlement of the interior , and how these changes are related to issues such as language contact and language borrowing from native americans . chapter 5 continues this process by developing examples of regional dialects and variations from many areas of the united states . chapters 6 and 7 develop the idea of dialects beyond regional and geographical differences to encompass dialect change and differences based on social class , ethnicity and gender . these chapters consider key issues such as the patterning of social difference in language in the context of specific examples , such as african american vernacular english ( aave ) . it is interesting to note in this example that even though at least eight distinctive grammatical features distinguish aave from the anglo american dialect , there is variation within each group sufficient to make comparisons difficult for linguists . a more general case is examined with respect to interactions of three or more languages , as is the case in robeson county nc , where native americans constitute 40 % of the county population , where their accent is clearly dominant . chapters 8 and 9 moves away from group analysis of dialects and language to questions of individual language use and style , and the social distribution of these usages . theories of style shifting , such as the attention to speech model , speech accommodation theory and the audience design model are reviewed , and research methods for understanding individual speech acts within paradigms that focus on group-based methods are discussed ( including corpus methods ) . group - exclusive dialect features and dialect patterning are discussed in the context of research methods such as implicational arrays to relate specific grammatical features of different dialects . the book concludes with discussions of the relevance of an understanding of accents and dialects to applied linguistics , an issue which is clearly important historically with the "" desirability-deficit "" debate and in contemporary education of english as a second language . in particular , the use of standardized tests which are based around the recognition of standard english usage and grammar are criticized for being unrealistic ( as well as violating assumptions of content validity ) . one solution might be to use a dialect consistency or achievement measure , and / or developing culturally and linguistically-appropriate testing situations which do not make assumptions about a language learner 's accent and / or social demographics . as the authors recognise , these kinds of aims are very difficult to implement , but certainly recognising the systematic biases in language testing , and encouraging dialect awareness in schools , is a first step . wolfram and schilling - estes explicitly accommodate pedagogical usage of this book , by introducing key concepts in capitals , and including an exercise for students with each new section in the text . at the conclusion of each chapter , there is a very useful "" further reading "" section which will also be useful to students , as will the glossary of common linguistic terms at the end of the book . a skeletal phonetics chart is accompanied by an appendix of socially-diagnostic structures , which will be useful for those working in clinical linguistics . the only criticism which could be levelled at the teaching material in the book is that no solutions are provided for the exercises , so perhaps the development of a separate teacher 's guide ( especially for foreign or tesol instructors ) might be an appropriate future inclusion to this otherwise impressive account of american english . reviewed by : paul a . watters , department of computing , school of mathematics , physics , computing and electronics , macquarie university nsw 2109 , australia . tel . : + 61 -

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting , asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate these problems by imposing a market disciplining . ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials , credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets enron has been moving into over the last few years . on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room . i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the room would be very important to me . as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 , may 3 / 4 are good for me . regards nalin at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote : > hi , > > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr . > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options , > etc . > > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems . > > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about > the following : > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) . > > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect > to telecoms , broadband , etc . > * who you would like to meet with me - vince kaminski ( our > boss ) , any other of our colleagues in research , broadband , etc . > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc . > > > > > look forward to hearing from you . > > regards , > iris",Safe Email

50 TIPS TO MAKE WINDOWS MORE USEFUL 
Do you have to deal with Windows on a daily basis? Might as well 
maximize your time with it. You'll find that some of these tips 
will apply to other operating systems, too. The world of computing 
isn't so mysterious once you understand how it works. With this 
GnomeTome, you'll begin to work faster - and smarter. 
Download Windows Productivity Tips now!  I did a lot this weekend, but I didn't really get much done, 
ya know? My knees are killing me from hauling stuff out of 
the basement for storage up in the attic, but the pile only 
made it as far as the kitchen. Then I stripped and painted 
the floor where that collection of stuff was previously 
stored, and erected some shelving so I'd have room for more 
stuff. I woke up the next morning discover a very sick 
ferret, likely from the fumes that leeched into the next 
room over despite the ventilation I had setup to prevent the 
migration of bad air. So, I ended up dismantling the ferret 
cage to move it upstairs for a week or so until I'm sure 
it's safe. Thankfully, all critters are doing well now.I also started in on replacing the cheapo rusted screws 
with stainless steel deck screws out back, but found that 
the ones I picked up are too weak, leaving me with stripped 
out heads and bent shafts. That project stopped after barely 
getting started. The front steps are also in need of rust-
proof screws, but they are made from much softer wood, so I 
moved the tools to the other side of the house. Two-thirds 
of the way through the first row, I found that the extra 
1/2"" on the screws I purchased was too much and I began 
running into the top of the old concrete steps underneath. 
Figures. Live and learn. Oh well, it was entirely too hot to work outside anyway. 
Back down to the basement I went to geek out instead. 
Roughly an hour into geekitude, I glanced over and realized 
it was 78.7 degrees in the basement and I was virtually 
stuck to my chair from the sweat. I shut off as much as I 
really could and still work on a couple of projects, but it 
didn't help the heat situation much. It was just too hot 
outside for the air conditioner to keep up with the added 
heat from the computers. That left me in need of a shower 
and with only the notebook in the living room for the 
balance of the weekend. I cleaned out a lot of ancient 
email, which was nice, but nothing really got accomplished 
otherwise. Boy, am I tired. And the weekend is so far away.Hey, the second season of M*A*S*H comes out on DVD 
tomorrow! That should put me in better spirits. I could 
watch M*A*S*H for hours on end. In fact, I often do just 
that. The only kink is that the episodes don't play back-to-back 
from DVD. I'm going to play with AppleScript on the Mac 
to see if I can customize how the individual discs play. In 
theory, I should be able to make a disc play all the way 
through. If I succeed, I'll be sure to share the script 
technique in the AppleCore newsletter. Too bad I can't do that with a stand-alone DVD player.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeNETWORK
Slow File Save Dialog Boxes
Pointed out by Ian Hargreaveshttp://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q321126
I've hated this one for a long time, and now we have a 
hotfix and a workaround, so take your pick as to which will 
work best. I often map drive letters to specific network 
shares, and if I happen to have a system turned off, I'll 
notice a significant delay when clicking the drop-down boxes 
in Open, Look In or Save In/As dialog boxes. Windows 2000 
attempts to reconnect to mapped resources before showing you 
the list, and depending on how many drives you have mapped 
and how many of those resources are unavailable, it can take 
eons just to save a file. A workaround is to use the My 
Network Places functionality instead of mapping drive 
letters. Fine for some, but I prefer having drive letters 
mapped for many things, being that I work at a command 
prompt quite a bit, and it's easier to navigate that way. 
Alternatively, a hotfix is now available, but you'll have to 
contact Microsoft to obtain the fix if that's the route you 
choose.

Customized 9x/ME Blue Screen Errors
http://www.vsres.com/blscrn/
We've all seen 'em. Those annoyingly incoherent blue 
screens indicating a system error of some sort, but provide 
no real help in solving the problem. If you're a programmer 
that has had to deal with error conditions produced by 
Windows 95/98/ME, then this might be a better way to handle 
them within your applications. Blue Screen v1.21 is an 
ActiveX control that uses the standard Windows system error 
functions, but provides a way to pass along text and 
response options you designate. Note that this is not 
functional on Windows NT/2000/XP, which handle system errors 
in an entirely different manner.Gamers Beware of Intel 845G Chipset
http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4532
http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4513
Discount the AMD hype and returned volley from Intel when 
reading up on all of this, but one thing is painfully clear. 
The Intel 845G chipset and P4 Celeron processors really 
don't provide an acceptable gaming experience. Not only is 
performance subject to ridicule, but compatibility is also 
looking to be a serious matter. Intel has never claimed that 
Celerons were high-end desktop processors, but they have 
typically provided a decent enough experience that they can 
make for acceptable machines for the more budget-minded 
consumer. The compatibility issues with this particular 
version of Celeron and the 845G chipset are something to 
watch out for. Once the Celeron is moved to the .13 micron 
core, I suspect the performance concern won't remain, but 
the 845G alone seems to have it's own problems without 
adding the Celeron misery. The lesson in knowing what 
hardware you're buying is what's important here.Â GnomeALERTZ

Test Drive Compaq Servers
http://www.testdrive.compaq.com/
Compaq (Ok, HP) offers a set of servers running various 
*nix operating systems, as well as Oracle 9i, for test 
drive. Just register for an account and you can tinker 
around with Linux, FreeBSD or even Tru64 Unix running on an 
Alpha server, but without the hassle and expense of 
obtaining your own toys. I love the idea of having a pre-
configured environment that lets you kick the tires without 
causing any permanent damage.

Too Cool
http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,102779,00.asp
This was just too interesting not to mention. Water-cooled 
systems are all-the-rage among overclockers and those 
that seem to need bragging rights over their friends' computer 
systems. Hitachi is taking a chapter from that tome and 
applying the concept where it's truly needed - notebook 
computers. Believe me when I say that these suckers get very 
hot. I spend half my life with notebook planted on lap, and 
I have to put something between the two surfaces to avoid my 
own little heat stroke. Fans and the mini water cooling 
system Hitachi is implementing provide roughly the same heat 
mitigation efficiency, but without the noise. The concept of 
a water-cooled notebook sounds a little odd, but I would 
welcome the elimination of the turbine droning with open 
arms.

I'm a bit confused about this boycott thing.  How is what China is
doing any different than having Scientology and who ever else
state-side who takes the whim evoking the DMCA to close down foreign
sites they deem inappropriate?  At least the Chinese make it voluntary
and ask politely, rather than just sending legal musclemen first off.--

"the ldc united nations corpus in linguist 6 . 973 and a parallel query to the corpora list , rapahel salkie asked some questions about the un parallel corpus from the linguistic data consortium ( ldc ) . before these queries appeared , a response to an earlier query from dr . salkie had already gone out privately from rebecca finch . i certainly urge anyone with experience in using the un corpus to respond to dr . salkie as well . we have also placed a sample of 24 ( out of 21 , 000 ) parallel documents , each in english , french and spanish , in : ftp : / / ftp . cis . upenn . edu / pub / ldc / data _ samples / un _ par _ sample . tar . z these samples should also be accessible , along with quite a bit of other ldc information , from the www page at url http : / / www . cis . upenn . edu / ~ ldc let me add a few words about ldc prices and costs , since dr . salkie 's message expressed the normal human annoyance at being asked to part with money , both in the case of the un corpus and another ( not yet published ) ldc parallel text corpus , the canadian hansard . the ldc membership fee for a university is $ 2 , 000 , and for this fee everyone at that university can get an unlimited and perpetual research license for everything that the ldc publishes during the year of membership . thus you can join the other ninety current members of the corsortium and get not only the forthcoming hansard corpus , but also the other twenty or so databases published this year . for the same amount , a university can get the un corpus and the other 15 databases published in 1994 . whether a particular database , or collection of databases , is worth that amount of money is of course a matter of individual or institutional judgement . we feel that $ 2 , 000 , which is roughly the cost of a moderately configured pc or an international conference trip , is not out of line even for university researchers . speaking for myself , i have a great deal of sympathy for the effort to provide research resources free or at minimal cost , and i have been involved in several successful efforts to bring out such databases over the years , including the acl / dci cd-rom , the eci disk , the celex disk , and others offered in the range of $ 25 - $ 200 . these efforts rely heavily on volunteer labor and other donated resources ; in several cases they have also relied on cash donations from the ldc . however , volunteer labor is rarely available in the needed quantities ; and of course ldc - supplied cash , as well as the existence of the ldc as an organization , depends on income from somewhere . the money that we get from memberships and database sales is a crucial part of the picture - - - without it the ldc would not exist , and neither would either of the databases under discussion . to highlight the point , the history of the u . n . publication is worth reviewing briefly . we decided to try to publish the u . n . archives because translation researchers wanted parallel texts . after concluding several months of negotiations with un representatives and lawyers for both sides , we paid for a nj - based computer consultant to go into the un offices at night so as to make backups of the archives from dismountable disk packs for a long-obsolete wang word processor onto cartridge tapes . this required several months and cost a considerable sum ; we had to use this particular person because he was an authorized service rep for the un facility . then came six person-months of work at the ldc . we had to decode the proprietary and undocumented wang backup format , and the equally proprietary and undocumented wang character set , typographical codes and file structures . we re-organized the entire archive and translated it into wordperfect format , and published a certain number of cd-rom s in this form for the purposes of the un - - - this was part of the agreement that we made with them for access to the data . then we translated the documents into iso-8859 - 1 with sgml markup ( including a working dtd , for those how care ) , and worked out the correspondences among documents . this was far from trivial , since each un language had been entered separately , with no coordination of file names , file dates , or even division of documents into files , and there were tens of thousands of documents per language . this work was mainly done by dave graff , whose salary the ldc pays . we are not likely to recover the costs of acquisition and production of this database through sales and memberships bought for its sake . we subsidize our members by cost-sharing with government grants , or by using income from more popular or less expensive databases to cover unrecovered costs of less popular or more expensive ones . in the case of the forthcoming hansard corpus , which dr . salkie also mentioned , the cost of acquisition and publication has been similar to that of the u . n . material , and the same remarks about subsidies apply . whether a particular database is worth a certain price is a matter of individual taste , but as a matter of simple arithmetic , the fees charged in these two cases are unlikely ever to cover the costs incurred . for those who have read this far , i would like to repeat a standing offer that has been in existence since the beginning of the ldc . if you are interested in cd-rom publication of a language-related database that is plausibly of interest to our membership , and this database is reasonably close to being in shape to publish , we will pay the costs of production , using your label design or one worked out with you ; we will give you up to a hundred copies to do with as you see fit ; we will put the item in our catalogue at whatever price you choose ; and we will remit to you any resulting income in excess of our production costs . the copyright ( if any ) will remain with you , and we will handle any user license arrangements that may be necessary , sending the signed licenses to you . we have published several databases on this basis , and are planning to publish several others , although ( from past experience ) the chances of making back our production costs are no better than even . best wishes , mark liberman myl @ unagi . cis . upenn . edu 619 williams hall university of pennsylvania phone : 215-898 - 0141 philadelphia , pa 19104-6305 fax : 215-573 - 2175",Safe Email

"deb mcdonald reveals a little bit of ngpl ' s strategy in interview ngpl recontracts with nipsco natural gas pipeline company of america ( ngpl ) continues to move through the recontracting process like a hot knife through butter . since kinder morgan took over ngpl parent kn energy last year , the interstate pipeline subsidiary has signed multiple agreements and contract extensions for gas transportation and storage with its major shippers in the midwest , including another deal announced yesterday with northern indiana public service ( nipsco ) . ngpl and nipsco signed a contract extending the terms of several firm transportation agreements totaling 295 , 100 mmbtu / d of capacity beginning dec . 1 , 2000 and dec . 1 , 2001 and continuing through nov . 30 , 2002 . they also extended the terms of two storage agreements totaling 10 . 5 bcf of capacity beginning dec . 1 , 2000 and april 1 , 2001 and continuing through march 31 , 2003 . nipsco , a nisource subsidiary , is a regulated utility that provides natural gas o nearly 700 , 000 customers and electricity to 416 , 000 customers across the northern third of indiana . "" virtually all of our operationally available capacity is sold out now until the fourth quarter of this year , "" said ngpl president deborah mcdonald in an interview . "" basically about a third of the transportation contracts and a third of the storage contracts are up for renewal every year . we ' ve been very successful in our efforts resigning our three major customers [ nigas , nipsco and peoples ] . "" despite increasing competitive pressure from northern border and alliance pipeline , the pipeline also has had surprising luck signing agreements with marketers and power generators . "" in contrast to the traditional market of long - haul transportation from the midcontinent and louisiana to chicago , we have been extending our horizons trying to find a new market in the marketers rather than the core ldcs . obviously the contract that we signed earlier this year with aquila energy for 500 , 000 mmbtu of transportation capacity has also really helped us be successful in our recontracting efforts , "" mcdonald said . "" we also have developed a number of new rate services for gas - fired power generators . growth in ngpl will come from natural gas - fired generation . you probably saw our press release about the ameren contracts for [ construction of 1 , 700 mw of generation along the ngpl system ] . in the aggregate we think we are on target to connect over 3 , 000 mw of gas - fired generation this year and over 3 , 000 mw next year as well [ which would represent up to 900 mmcf / d in gas transportation capacity ] . "" obviously another challenge is going to be [ the 1 . 325 bcf / d ] alliance pipeline coming into the market this fall . it ' s anyone ' s guess whether that will really fill up in a short period of time . i think a lot of that will be coming into chicago and moving back out on vector . but we ' re ready at hub america to kind of serve as a giant header system [ with texas eastern as an eastbound partner ] . "" mcdonald was not prepared , however , to announce the results of a recent open season for about 100 mmcf / d of capacity that will be available through a new interconnection between ngpl and tetco for eastbound transportation .",Safe Email

spamassassin/razor interaction.Now for a razor question:I'm worried about having a server full of razor-agent.log files which keep
on growing.  Is it possible to configure razor log via SYSLOG to make it
easy to rotate logs?  Searching through the man pages didn't turn anything
up...  Otherwise I'll have to write a script to go through each user's home
directory looking for razor-agent.log files to rotate periodically.Thanks,
Dave

"sex bias and epicenes h . stephen straight is right to mention the importance of the essentially psychological evidence in favor of the idea that epicene he biases perceptions in favor male interpretations . there are considerable number of studies of this effect and a few attempts at interpretation as to how it comes about . essentially , the studies take two tacks . one model involves an interpretation task of some kind in which subjects are induced to provide some form of evidence of male or female interpretation of the referent of some generic epicene . the independent variable was the pronoun coreferent to epicene antecedents in invented sentences presented to subjects . subjects give names to characters , draw pictures , or say directly whether a character is male or female , etc . this type began back in 1970 , with an almost impossible to locate study by kidd . the most famous version was probably martyna 's ( 1978 , 1980 ) work and the latest version i am aware of was an experiment by gastil in 1990 . also , there were experiments by kosrohshahi in 1989 , moulton , robins , & elias in 1978 , and switzer in 1990 . the other type involves production tasks in which subjects selected a coreferential pronoun to complete sentences with antecedents refering generic epicene referents . here the independent variable was the degree of sex-stereotypicality of the generic referent ( e . g . marine vs . teenager vs . nurse ) . this type of study was inaugurated by martyna ( 1978 , 1980 ) . it was also used by gastil . in almost all studies uses of he strongly correlat with male interpretations of the referent . my own naturalistic data shows the same result with referents like ' lumberjack ' and ' particpants in congressional sex scandal ' used more with he than say ' child , ' or ' teacher . ' there are others along both lines , which will be supplied upon request . as for explanations , the most interesting ones for someone ( like me ) who tends to be skeptical of pernicious influences of grammar on other aspects of cognition ( please let 's not start that one again ) are by mcconnell - ginet in a number of articles ( e . g . 1988 ) and moulton back in 1977 . moulton eschews notions of markedness and instead compares it to the kleenex effect whereby the identity of a prestigious subset is assumed by the superordinate category , with the result that people tend to think of the subset as more prototypical . so kleenex are most prototypical paper tissues , sanka is the prototypical decaf coffee ( in the us ) , and so on . note that this involves cognitive interaction with lexical semantics ; there is nothing morphosyntactic going on here . refs : ( i ' ll put full names whenever i remember ; i do n't want to look up all the arts . ) gastil , john ( 1990 ) "" generic pronouns and sexist language sex roles , 23 629-643 kidd , v .

""" sum : have / hold / compulsion / existence about a month ago , i posted an enquiry asking for help in finding non - ie languages , in which there was a connection between any of the following expressions : ' hold ' and ' possess ' , synchronically or diachronically ' exist ' and ' possess ' ' must / should ' and ' possess ' and i was quite happy about the enthusiastic reponse ( around 20 of you contacted me ) . so , for all who are interested , here is a short summary . i hope i have n't left anyone out and that i have n't confused anything , as i know next to nothing about the languages you all told me about . there was also the small 'd isaster ' with my email - i accidentally deleted some of your answers , so i apologize if you answered but do n't find your name in the list . i would like to take the chance now to thank all those who did answer with information on the following languages : japanese : here , the verb mot - ' hold ' can also be used to a large extent for ' possess ' , but not for ' existence ' or ' compulsion ' also , an anonymous reply pointed out another construction for ' possess ' with aru - ' exist ' , but was not sure about the difference in meaning between ' possess ' with mot - and ' possess ' with aru . basque : * edun ( nowadays - du - ) is used for possession and as an auxiliary . in addition , in the south , the verb eduki ' hold ' has also to some extent been grammaticalized to denote ' possess ' and also ' perfect ' with transitive verbs , while intransitives form the perfect with izan ' be ' . this development seems to be following the lines of the development latin ) romance . hebrew : there is no verb ' possess ' in hebrew : possession is expressed periphrastically ( with the "" dative "" ) . interestingly , here also there is a connection between ' possess ' and ' compulsion ' and ' existence ' , which all apparently use this construction . aramaic : in many aramaic dialects , the earlier construction ' past participle + dative ( ' l ' ) + pronoun ' became the past tense . l is now predominantly used for a goal with verbs of motion , but is also used for possession . arabic : in cairene colloquial arabic , @ anda ' at / near / by ' is used for possession and is then negated like a verb , not like a preposition . tamil iru ' be ( located ) ' + dative is used for possession and for durative / continuous aspect , but not for perfect / perfective . kol ' hold ' , although not used for ' possess ' can be combined with iru and denotes that the action is one of the following : self-benefactive , reflexive , deliberate and / or accidental ( depending on what was expected ) . crow : ' exist ' / ' not-exist ' is not only used for existence but also ' possess ' and perfective aspect . finish : pitaa ' hold ' can also be used to express ' compulsion ' but interestingly , not ' possess ' . dakota : yuha ' hold ' may also be used to some extent for ' have ' , otherwise ' be with ' is used . chinese : yong3yiu3 , where yong3 denotes ' embrace ' , can also be used to express ' possess , own ' . to stress that one has total control , one may use zhung3yiu3 , where zhung3 denotes ' hold in one 's palm ' ( yiu3 is ' possess ' , ' existence ' and can also be used for ' perfect ' with questions and negative statements ) idg * ghebh ' give ' -

"kitahara review . hisatsugu kitahara , ( 1997 ) elementary operations and optimal derivations , mit press , cambridge , mass . 140 pages , $ 15 . 00 . reviewed by julie legate , < jlegate @ mit . edu > this book is very firmly situated within the minimalist approach to syntactic theory that was begun by chomsky ( 1991 ) and perhaps most fully articulated in chomsky ( 1995 ) . it adopts much of the basic architecture of the 1995 version of minimalism ( henceforth mp ) , while deriving several of its principles and assumptions . the first three chapters of the book propose some comparatively minor alterations to the mp system , and demonstrate that these alterations allow several stipulations of the mp to be dropped , while retaining or improving the framework 's empirical coverage . the final chapter retains the proposals of the previous chapters while putting forth a new condition that is a more clear departure from the mp approach . with this condition , kitahara is able to account for several notoriously problematic wh-constructions . kitahara 's first chapter consists of a review of the minimalist syntactic framework . he discusses the conceptual foundation of the approach ( the unflinching application of occam 's razor to every aspect of the computational system ) , the guiding principles of global economy , as well as the internal mechanisms of the computation ( including the creation of syntactic trees through successive operations of merge and of morphological feature-driven move ) . his second chapter contains the core proposals of the book . kitahara replaces the operations of merge , move , and erase by two "" elementary operations "" : "" concatenation "" and "" replacement "" . concatenation is the procedure which joins two objects alpha and beta to form a new object k . replacement , on the other hand , substitutes an object alpha for an object beta , where beta is contained within a larger object sigma . the mp operations are redefined using these elementary operations as follows ( p35 ) : ( i ) cyclic merge = concatenation cyclic move = concatenation noncyclic merge = concatenation + replacement noncyclic move = concatenation + replacement erase = replacement he further redefines the shortest derivation condition ( chomsky 1991 , 1993 ; epstein 1992 ) in terms of these operations , as in ( ii ) ( p26 ) : ( ii ) shortest derivation condition ( sdc ) minimize the number of elementary operations necessary for convergence . given this technology , he proceeds to derive several of the principles and assumptions of mp . first , he considers cyclicity , providing a detailed summary and comparison of the approaches taken in chomsky 1993 , 1994 , and 1995 . he derives that , in simple cases , cyclic convergent derivations should be preferred over noncyclic convergent ones , since cyclic operations yield a shorter derivation . as shown in ( i ) above , cyclic operations involve only one elementary operation : concatenation , whereas noncyclic ones require two : concatenation and replacement . next , he turns to the mp principle of procrastinate : covert movement ( i . e . movement which occurs in the computation after the derivation is sent to pf for pronunciation ) is preferable to overt movement . he separates the discussion into head movement , object shift , and expletive insertion . he adopts the mp assumptions that ( a ) movement results in two instances of identical elements , one in the merged position and the other in the moved position ( i . e . the copy theory of movement ) ; ( b ) if an element is overtly attracted , the entire category moves , whereas if an element is covertly attracted , only the formal features move ; and ( c ) only one of the identical elements created by movement is interpreted at lf . finally , he proposes a novel interpretation of effect of strong features in the grammar , as in ( iii ) ( p37 ) : ( iii ) strong feature condition spell - out applies to sigma only if sigma contains no category with a strong feature . regarding head movement , in languages with overt verb raising , t has a strong v feature and thus overt raising is necessary for convergence . in languages without overt verb raising , the sdc selects derivations with covert , rather than overt , verb raising . although both covert and overt head movement involve one operation of replacement ( since head movement is necessarily non-cyclic ) , kitahara claims that overt head movement , being category movement requires an additional instance of replacement , thus resulting in a longer derivation . his reasoning is as follows . if a verb moves overtly , its semantic features are carried along . therefore , at lf it will be necessary to delete one of the instances of the semantic features , since elements are only interpreted once . this requires an application of replacement that is not needed for covert movement , since covert movement only affects the formal features , not the semantic features as well . notice that the same reasoning will not extend to phrasal movement . overt movement will require one instance of replacement to delete the semantic features of one member of the chain ( just considering a simple two-membered chain ) , however covert movement will also require one instance of replacement , since covert movement is necessarily non-cyclic . thus , the sdc cannot choose between derivations with overt object shift and those without . this predicts the optionality of object shift in languages like icelandic , without resorting to the mp ' optional strong feature ' analysis , which is a simple restatement of the facts . in languages without overt verb movement , object shift is predicted to be impossible , assuming that the object shifts to the outside specifier of vp , the inside specifier being the merged position of the subject , and that multiple specifiers are not equidistant from a higher head , unless head movement renders them equidistant . thus , the shifted object would block movement of the subject to tp , unless the verb has raised to t . kitahara acknowledges ( p144 , fn26 ) , however , that he cannot explain languages like french , that display overt verb raising but prohibit object shift . finally , kitahara considers the timing of expletive insertion . notice that although mp assumes that merge is cheaper than move , kitahara 's reanalysis predicts that merge be equally economical to cyclic move , since both consist of one application of concatenation . since the timing of expletive insertion is the primary empirical motivation for the mp assumption , kitahara demonstrates that this timing is equally captured within his system . consider the familiar sentences ( iv ) and ( v ) . ( iv ) there seems to be a man in the room . ( v ) * there seems a man to be in the room . in ( iv ) , the expletive was inserted in the embedded [ spec , t ] and raised to the matrix tp . in ( v ) , on the other hand , "" a man "" was raised to the embedded tp and the expletive was inserted directly into the specifier of the matrix tp . mp claimed that ( iv ) is preferred over ( v ) because it is cheaper to merge the expletive into the embedded tp than to move the associate . kitahara claims that these facts follow from his sdc . since expletives are assumed to have no semantic features , overt raising of "" there "" will not require an application of replacement to delete an instance of semantic features in ( iv ) . in ( v ) , on the other hand , overt raising of "" a man "" will require replacement to delete one of the resulting two instances of the semantic features of "" a man "" . therefore , the derivation in ( iv ) is shorter than that in ( v ) and thus preferred . as a side point , notice that this analysis requires that the formal features of "" a man "" raise covertly directly to the matrix t . if these features raised to the embedded tp covertly , the non-cyclic movement would result in an additional application of replacement , and ( iv ) and ( v ) should be equally economical ( an equivalent situation to object shift ) . kitahara concludes chapter two with a note about the timing of expletive insertion in icelandic transitive expletive constructions . he assumes the mp analysis that the associate ( i . e . the subject of the transitive ) moves into the inner specifier of tp and the expletive merges into the outer specifier of tp , the verb appearing between the two as a verb-second phenomenon . he notes that although this situation is the opposite of the english situation discussed above , i . e . here category movement precedes expletive insertion , this is predicted by the restriction against downwards movement . assuming the associate must move to adjoin to the expletive at lf , the associate must appear lower than the expletive , in order for this movement to be raising rather than lowering . in chapter three , kitahara demonstrates that chomsky 's ( 1995 ) minimal link condition can explain phenomena which had previously received disparate analyses in the literature . ( vi ) minimal link condition ( mlc ) h ( k ) attracts alpha only if there is no beta , beta closer to h ( k ) than alpha , such that h ( k ) attracts beta . kitahara begins with relativized minimality ( chomsky 1993 ) violations , as in ( vii ) , and superiority condition violations , as in ( viii ) . ( vii ) * john seems it is t ( john ) certain to be here . ( viii ) * what did you persuade whom to buy t ( what ) ? the mlc accounts naturally for these facts : in ( vii ) , "" it "" is closer than "" john "" to the matrix t , and thus blocks attraction of "" john "" ; in ( viii ) , "" whom "" is closer to the matrix cp than "" what "" and thus blocks attraction of "" what "" . next , kitahara considers proper binding condition violations , like that shown in ( x ) . ( ix ) proper binding condition traces must be bound . ( x ) * which picture of t ( who ) do you wonder who john likes t ( which picture of t ( who ) ) ? he argues that a proper binding condition analysis of ( x ) is no longer available in minimalist approaches . this condition can no longer apply at s - structure , since s - structure has been eliminated from the model , and lf reconstruction of "" picture of t ( who ) "" could create a configuration in which the trace of "" who "" is bound . instead , kitahara offers an mlc solution . he observes that ( x ) involves two violations of the minimal link condition . first , "" which "" is closer to the embedded cp than "" who "" and thus blocks the attraction of "" who "" ( note that "" picture of who "" would be necessarily carried along with "" which "" to the embedded cp by an independent convergence condition ) . second , given the illegitimate attraction of "" who "" to the embedded cp , "" who "" becomes closer to the matrix cp than "" which "" , and thus blocks the attraction of "" which "" . assuming that ( xi ) a derivation employing a greater number of illegitimate steps induces a greater degree of deviance ( p72 ) the derivation in ( xii ) below is preferred over ( x ) because ( x ) involves two violations of the mlc whereas ( xii ) involves only one . ( xii ) ? ? who do you wonder which picture of t ( who ) john likes t ( which picture of who ) ? kitahara extends this analysis to crossing versus nesting dependency data . ( xiii ) nested dependency condition ( pesetsky 1987 ) if two "" wh "" - trace dependencies overlap , one must contain the other . the paradigm cases are those in ( xiv ) and ( xv ) : ( xiv ) ? ? what did you wonder whom john persuaded t ( whom ) to buy t ( what ) ? ( xv ) ? * whom did you wonder what john persuaded t ( whom ) to buy t ( what ) ? in ( xiv ) , kitahara observes , the mlc is disobeyed once , in the raising of "" what "" over "" whom "" to the matrix cp . in ( xv ) , on the other hand , the mlc is disobeyed twice , once in the raising "" what "" over "" whom "" to the embedded cp , and a second time in the raising of "" whom "" over "" what "" to the matrix cp . thus , following ( ix ) , the grammar prefers ( xiv ) over ( xv ) . finally , kitahara considers scrambling and topicalization in german and japanese , demonstrating that certain restrictions on these phenomena can also receive an mlc treatment . he assumes that both phenomena are feature driven , and that the scrambling / topicalization feature of the attracted element is interpretable , and thus remains accessible to the computation after checking . the basic pattern considered is that it is not possible to scramble an element from a constituent and then scramble the remnant , however it is possible to then topicalize the remnant . german examples are provided in ( xvi ) and ( xvii ) : ( xvi ) scrambling + scrambling of remnant * dass [ t ( das buch ) zu lesen ] keiner [ das buch ] t ( t ( das buch ) zu lesen ) that ( the book ) to read no one the book ( the book to read ) versucht hat tried has "" that no one has tried to read the book "" ( xvii ) scrambling + topicalization of remnant [ t ( das buch ) zu lesen ] hat keiner [ das buch ] t ( t ( das buch ) zu lesen ) ( the book ) to read has no one the book ( the book to read ) versucht tried "" no one has tried to read the book "" under these assumptions , ( xvi ) violates the mlc twice , first by scrambling the dp "" that book "" over the closer vp "" that book to read "" , and second by scrambling the vp "" t ( that book ) to read "" over the now-closer dp "" that book "" . ( xvii ) , on the other hand , does not violate the mlc at all . assuming that the features that drive topicalization and scrambling are distinct , "" that book "" would be the closest available element with the scrambling feature to the attracting head , since "" that book to read "" would have a topicalization feature rather than a scrambling feature . similarly , the vp "" t ( that book ) to read "" is the closest available element to be attracted for topicalization , since "" that book "" has a scrambling feature not a topicalization feature . in chapter four , kitahara discusses the differences in deviance between derivations which involve one violation of the mlc by a wh-element . he provides the generalization in ( xviii ) , and examples in ( xix ) - ( xxii ) ( p83 - 85 ) : ( xviii ) an mlc violation involving adjuncts , subjects , or quasi objects [ i . e . "" how many "" phrases ] is far more severe than an mlc violation involving objects . ( xix ) adjunct * how do you wonder [ whether john fixed the car t ( how ) ? ( xx ) subject * what do you wonder [ whether t ( what ) was fixed t ( what ) ] ? ( xxii ) quasi - object * how many pounds do you wonder [ whether john weighed t ( how many ) ] ? ( xxii ) object ? ? what do you wonder [ whether john fixed t ( what ) ] ? in order to explain this phenomenon , kitahara proposes the following condition ( p90 ) : ( xxiii ) chain formation condition an application of move forms 1 or > 1 chain ( s ) only if it is legitimate ( = violation-free ) and assumes that traces may be attracted ( at least covertly ) . he claims that the illegitimate wh-movements in ( xix ) - ( xxii ) do not form a chain . therefore , the wh-elements will not be able to be interpreted at lf , causing the derivation to crash . this accounts for the ungrammaticality of ( xix ) - ( xxii ) . in ( xxii ) , however , kitahara claims that the formal features of the trace of "" what "" raise covertly to check accusative case , and that it is this movement that saves the derivation . ( notice that covert movement of the traces of the wh-elements in ( xxiv ) - ( xxvi ) will not occur . adjuncts and quasi objects do not check case , and subjects move overtly to check case . ) according to the chain formation condition , the movement of the formal features of the object , being legitimate , may form one or more chains ; in particular , it forms a chain between the raised position of "" what "" in the matrix cp and the merged position of "" what "" . thus , the derivation can be interpreted at lf , and has only the status of a mlc violation . kitahara extends the analysis to ( xxiv ) . ( xxiv ) "" where "" / "" when "" adjuncts ? ? where / when do you wonder [ whether john fixed the car t ( where / when ) ? he assumes that these adjuncts are the complement of a null preposition . therefore , the formal features of the trace of "" where "" / "" when "" must raise covertly to check case with the null preposition , again creating the necessary chain between the moved position of "" where "" / "" when "" in the matrix cp and its merged position . this chapter concludes the book . although this book stands solidly on the foundations of previous minimalist syntactic research , it remains accessible to those who are not well-versed in minimalist theory . it provides very clear explanations of the details of previous minimalist approaches , as well as kitahara 's own proposals . furthermore , all relevant derivations are presented step-by - step , at a pace designed to accommodate the non-specialist . thus , it presents a good opportunity for those interested to learn about research and issues in minimalist syntax . those who are familiar with minimalist research should find this to be an interesting reworking and application of 1995 - style minimalism . anyone convinced by recent discussions of computational complexity and local economy ( see collins 1997 , johnson & lappin 1997 , yang 1997 , among others ) , however , will be dissatisfied with the approach , as it continues to rely on global economy conditions . since , of course , not everyone has been convinced by the discussion , this is more a note to prospective readers than a criticism . on a similar note , a crucial assumption for the analyses is that the grammar can count , which is controversial , but not obviously false . note that , regarding cyclicity , the notoriously problematic case of head - movement , which chomsky ( 1995 ) managed to incorporate into "" cyclicity "" requirements ( forcing it to apply before introduction of another head into the derivation ) , again falls outside the analysis of "" cyclicity "" . since all head - movement will require an operation of replacement , there is no longer any clear way to force it to apply before another head is introduced . perhaps more serious is the reformulation of the strong feature condition . the various strong feature conditions of previous minimalist approaches are simplified in the first chapter to ( ii ) above , repeated in ( xxv ) below . ( xxv ) strong feature condition spell - out applies to sigma only if sigma contains no category with a strong feature . the difficulty with this formulation is that it renders the strong feature condition an s - structure condition and thus anti - minimalist , since minimalism took great pains to eliminate all s - structure conditions . notice that it would be trivial to reformulate all previous s - structure conditions in a manner parallel to ( xxv ) - - "" spell - out applies to sigma only if sigma contains no traces which are not bound "" - - thus reducing the minimalist claim that s - structure is redundant to a matter of terminology only . furthermore , in the last chapter , a further condition involving strong features had to be introduced in order to rule out certain noncyclic derivations . this additional condition , given in ( xxvi ) , is essentially a weakened version of chomsky 's ( 1995 ) formulation of the strong feature condition . ( xxvi ) alpha and beta cannot be concatenated if some sublabel of alpha and some sublabel of beta are both strong ( p95 ) thus , the proposed simplification of the strong feature condition actually results in positing two conditions , one of which is an s - structure condition . another seemingly anti - minimalist proposal is the chain formation condition , given in ( xxiii ) above and repeated in ( xxvii ) below . ( xxvii ) chain formation condition an application of move forms 1 or > 1 chain ( s ) only if it is legitimate ( = violation-free ) minimalist theory claims that the computation of human language meets the inclusiveness condition , i . e . no new elements are added during the course of the computation . instead , the computation arranges and rearranges items selected from the lexicon . therefore , under minimalist theory , the notion of a "" chain "" as an independent entity does not exist , as it would have to be added during the course of the derivation , violating inclusiveness . instead , "" chain "" is simply a convenient term used to refer to the identical elements in a derivation . the chain formation condition , however , crucially requires chains to have an independent existence in the computation . these comments aside , this book does represent a step forward in the minimalist research program . kitahara is able to derive several assumptions / principles which previously could only be stipulated . the account of optionality in icelandic object shift is more satisfying than the "" optional strong feature "" approach , although , as was noted , it does raise some cross - linguistic considerations ( e . g . french ) . the systematic application of the minimal link condition to data captured by various other conditions was sorely needed , if only to confirm the intuitions that an mlc would have equal , or superior , empirical coverage . finally , the analysis of "" wh "" extraction asymmetries presented in the final chapter , is one of the few minimalist treatments of this phenomenon . all in all , the reader will find this book to be very well considered , clearly explained , and thought-provoking . biography julie anne legate is a phd student in the department of linguistics and philosophy at mit . her research interests include syntactic theory and irish syntax . bibliography chomsky , noam .

Dear Readers,One of the hot trends in notebooks is squeezing desktop processors,
not mobile CPUs, into laptops. Actually, the trend has been around
for a while, but the bigger vendors used to pooh-pooh these
efforts. (Intel was never too crazy about the idea, either.) Now,
it's a bona fide movement, and the latest 9.6-pound desktop-
replacement system from Toshiba takes this trend to new heights.
But questions abound: Are the extra pounds worth it? Do these 
things really get so hot that you can press pants with them? 
Executive Editor John Morris sorts it out for you.

"re : storage model : simple issues brad , here are my thoughts on your concerns . * you needs curve inputs . this is an it job . i can help you for the curves before the system is properly set up . * intrinsic value vs time value : the intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes . if you have a rough idea about the allocation as you did in the spreadsheet , we can calucate the intrinsic value within the model . the difference between the total and the intrinsic will be the ( option ) time value . however , by pre - allocating volumes , you killed some options . in the storage model , volumes are allocated dynamically , therefore it is hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs . time value . * factor of loading : factor of loadings are used to give historical correlation matrix . the three factors correspond to paralle shift , slopping and curveture . the covariance matrix in the model is expressed in the form covar = row ( vol _ { i } ) * ( correl ( i , j ) ) * colum ( vol _ { j } ) where vols are the implied volatilities from the vol curve . ( correl ( i , j ) ) = l * l ' + residue ( small ) where l is the factor of loading matrix . so in a simple words , the factor of loadings ( say , 60 x 3 ) are a simplier way for us to remember the historical correlation matrix ( say , 60 x 60 ) . let me know if i can offer further help . zimin brad horn 02 / 15 / 2000 07 : 15 am to : zimin lu / hou / ect @ ect cc : sandra henderson / hou / ect @ ect subject : storage model : simple issues zimin : thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation . your right to point out the similarity to market bids . here are some basic questions tied to implementation and calibration : model infrastructure / it support : i obviously need to re - build my link to the forward curves as the model is not working in my new location . short - term ( aprox 1 month ) , i ' d like to establish a link to the ena database egsprod 32 in order to fetch the long - dated price and volatility curves . my link to ena forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated by the new bridgeline entity ( database name and data structure yet to be defined ) . however , its not clear to me what is required in this two stage process to support your model . any definition of model input or minimum support requirements you provide is appreciated . i ' ll then work with sandra henderson , an enron employee providing our it support , to ensure the model continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases . meanwhile , is there anything you think you can do to ensure im up and running quickly ? sandra : linking excel spreadsheets to bridgeline forward curves will be key to all our pricing projects , not just the storage model supplied by research . intrinsic vs extrinsic value : it would be helpful to decompose the model ' s calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic ( time or option ) value . i could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value , and then through a simple difference i could determine the extrinsic value . ive included a simple spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review . i wanted to share this with you to ask the following : does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently than the simple difference proposed ? do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the backcode c - code via . dll in order to ensure run - time is faster ? my goal here is straightforward : a ) to better understand the model and its sensitivities . ; and b ) to determine if and when the option approach is associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of the time spreads . factor loadings : what are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with regards to factor loadings and how i should interpret the graph of the 3 factors calculated ? factor loadings have always been a mystery to me . for example , what problems should i be looking for as a warning against mispricing ? what , if anything , is implied about 1 day price change or expected curve re - shapings ( after all , curve - reshapings are key to storage valuation ! ! ! ) ? calibration : we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs . i ' ll share the data when we are and model results once im up and running .",Safe Email

"fw : the odds are against them there is no way to undermine the devastation and loss we ' ve all witnessed and felt over the last couple of weeks , but when you look at the following numbers and realize how much worse it could ' ve been , i guess there are a lot of people who were saved . . . subject : the odds are against them by now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise and reports of the destruction from the terrorist attacks on the us . these were deplorable acts that we will never forget . but now is a time to look at the other side of the numbers coming out of new york , washington and pennsylvania . the sad but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream media has not reported yet - the survival rates and some positive news about the attacks . * * * the buildings * * * * the world trade center - the twin towers of the world trade center were places of employment for some 50 , 000 people . with the missing list of just over 5 , 000 people , that means 90 % of the people targeted survived the attack . a 90 % on a test is an ' a ' . * the pentagon - some 23 , 000 people were the target of a third plane aimed at the pentagon . the latest count shows that only 123 lost their lives . that is an amazing 99 . 5 % survival rate . in addition , the plane seems to have come in too low , too early to affect a large portion of the building . on top of that , the section that was hit was the first of five sections to undergo renovations that would help protect the pentagon from terrorist attacks . it had recently completed straightening and blastproofing , saving untold lives . this attack was sad , but a statistical failure . * * * the planes * * * * american airlines flight 77 this boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of the pentagon could have carried up to 289 people , yet only 64 were aboard . luckily 78 % of the seats were empty . * american airlines flight 11 this boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people aboard , but only carried 92 . thankfully 74 % of the seats were unfilled . * united airlines flight 175 another boeing 767 that could have sat 351 people only had 65 people on board . fortunately it was 81 % empty . * united airlines flight 93 this boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting stories yet . the smallest flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out of a possible 289 had 84 % of its capacity unused . yet these people stood up to the attackers and thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a national landmark , saving untold numbers of lives in the process . * * * in summary * * * out of potentially 74 , 280 americans directly targeted by these inept cowards , 93 % survived or avoided the attacks . that ' s a higher survival rate than heart attacks , breast cancer , kidney transplants and liver transplants - all common , survivable illnesses . the hijacked planes were mostly empty , the pentagon was hit at it ' s strongest point , the overwhelming majority of people in the world trade center buildings escaped , and a handful of passengers gave the ultimate sacrifice to save even more lives . pass this information on to those in fear and the media . don ' t fear these terrorists . the odds are against them . regards , amy brock hbd marketing team office : 281 - 988 - 2157 cell : 713 - 702 - 6815 - - - - - original message - - - - - from : suzanne young [ smtp : syoung _ piedmont @ yahoo . com ] sent : friday , september 28 , 2001 7 : 42 am to : andrea ; janet bilyeu ; amy brock ; heather cottom ; crites ; christi degeare ; beverly edwards ; misty floyd ; leah haynes ; michele huneke ; john ; leslie ; vicki moyer ; kim pope ; kerri williams subject : fwd : the odds are against them note : forwarded message attached . do you yahoo ! ? listen to your yahoo ! mail messages from any phone . http : / / phone . yahoo . com = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ? easy unsubscribe click here : http : / / topica . com / u / ? a 84 vnf . a 9 ivhm ? or send an email to : brcc . yf - unsubscribe @ topica . com ? this email was sent to : dfarmer @ enron . com ? ? t o p i c a - - register now to manage your mail ! ? http : / / www . topica . com / partner / tago 2 / register ? = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =",Safe Email

"kornfilt : turkish jaklin kornfilt ( 1997 ) , turkish . london and new york : routledge . xxxi + 575 pp . 110 , us $ 180 . reviewed by steve seegmiller , montclair state university . jaklin kornfilt 's grammar of turkish ( hereafter referred to as turkish ) is the first new , comprehensive grammar of this language to be published in english in more than two decades . as such , its appearance is a significant event , especially since its author is a well known and respected authority on turkish . this is the latest title in the descriptive grammars series , edited by bernard comrie and published by routledge . the goals of the works in this series are different from those of most grammars : the descriptive grammars are intended for linguists rather than general users . all of the grammars in the series address the same issues in a uniform format so that a given feature may be easily compared across languages , and they contain information of a sort that is often absent from more traditional grammars . toward the end of the review i will comment briefly on the potential utility of this grammar for non-linguists , but for the most part i will focus on usefulness of the grammar for linguists . the descriptive grammars series now includes nearly 30 titles . according to the editorial preface , the series gives preference to languages for which comprehensive descriptions are not presently available ( iv ) . the aim of the series is to provide information to linguists who are interested in language typology , language universals , and comparative grammar , employing a terminology and a notation that will make the information accessible to linguists regardless of their particular specialization or orientation . authors of the grammars in the series are expected to organize their descriptions as answers to a series of questions ( originally published in lingua vol . 42 , no . 1 , 1977 ) . turkish contains over 600 pages , including the prefatory material , the table of contents , and the bibliography . the grammatical description alone amounts to just over 550 pages . it is thus roughly twice as long as lewis ( 1967 ) and about 100 pages longer than underhill ( 1976 ) . the book contains five chapters of widely varying lengths . chapter 1 ( syntax ) contains 211 pages , chapter 2 ( morphology ) 270 pages , chapter 3 ( phonology ) 32 pages , chapter 4 ideophones and interjections ) just 3 pages , and chapter 5 ( lexicon ) 16 pages . thus approximately 90 per cent of the book is devoted to morphology and syntax . furthermore , a good deal of the information in the morphology chapter deals with syntactic matters , giving the book an especially heavy bias toward syntax . . this distribution of information no doubt reflects both the interests of the author and the current emphasis of typological research . the chapters on phonology and the lexicon are both very well done and very useful ( more on this below ) , but they do not address all of the issues that might be of interest to a phonologist or a lexical semanticist . a notable feature of the book is the extensive and detailed table of contents . it is eleven pages long and , used in conjunction with the fourteen-page index , provides easy access to the an extensive body of information about turkish . how well does turkish accomplish its goals ? i think it handles syntax and morphology marvelously well , phonology and the lexicon adequately , and ideophones and interjections in a cursory fashion . the chapters on syntax and morphology provide the best , most detailed descriptions of these parts of the language available . the analyses are up to date and insightful , and kornfilt has done a superb job of bringing clarity to some of the most difficult parts of the language . in concept and terminology , the description straddles the line between generative and traditional or non-generative approaches . for instance , kornfilt uses the terms ' possessive adjective ' ( 105 ) and 'd emonstrative adjective ( 106 ) rather than the more usual ' possessive ' and 'd emonstrative . ' similarly , the descriptions are stated in terms of surface phenomena and grammatical constructions and not in any recognizable theoretical framework . this is probably the right choice , given the diverse backgrounds of the probable users of the grammar . the range of coverage is broad and thorough . kornfilt deals with sentence types , both simple and complex ; with negation and questions ; with grammatical categories and phrase types ; and with most of the other grammatical phenomena that might interest linguists . the morphology chapter contains information not just on inflection and derivation , but also on the uses of the various morphological forms . cross - referencing is extensive , making it easy for the reader to find all of the relevant information on a topic even if it is not found in the same section of the book . this approach of interrelating syntax and morphology is very useful and allows kornfilt to clarify some of the cloudy areas of turkish grammar . perhaps most notable are her treatments of the participial and nominal systems and their relation to subordination ( pp . 323-413 and at various places in chapter 1 ) . finite subordination is rare in turkish . a far more frequent pattern of subordination involves the use of a participial or nominalized verbal stem . the complexity of the system is mind-boggling to students of the language , but kornfilt 's description makes it coherent and intelligible . her treatment of other aspects of turkish morphology and syntax are equally well done . a very useful feature of turkish is the inclusion of information about what does * not * occur in the language . this is often essential information for linguists ( whether studying typology , syntax , or morphology ) and is rarely included in more traditional grammars . thus we find on page 104 the statement that postpostitions govern only one case ( with the lone exception of ' kadar ' ) . in lewis ( 1967 ) , this information can be inferred from the discussion of cases on pages 85-95 , but it is not so easy to find and not so categorically stated . there are many similar examples , especially in the syntax chapter . the chapter on phonology is short , clear , and precise , but it does not contain the amount of detail found in the syntax and morphology chapters . while the information presented will be adequate for many purposes , phonologists will no doubt wish for more elaborate discussions of issues like vowel harmony , stress assignment , and phonological ( or morphophonemic ) alternations . i found one omission in this chapter . on page 491 , the final devoicing rule is described as applying to syllable-final plosives and affricates , yet on page 487 there are examples of final devoicing of liquids as well , described as being standard but not universal . a cross-reference would have been useful here . for the most part , transcriptions in the phonology chapter follow the ipa norms . one exception , though , is the transcription of palatalized consonants by means of a comma rather than a raised j . ' while this may have been done for typographical reasons , it might confuse a casual user . chapter 4 , ideophones and interjections , is only 3 pages long and provides only the briefest commentary on these phenomena . while many linguists ( myself included ) will not mind the short shrift given to these topics , some will no doubt be disappointed that the list of ideophones occupies less than a page and a half . chapter 5 , lexicon , is a short but interesting sample of the lexicon of turkish . the chapter contains lists of words organized by semantic field . these include kinship terminology , color terms , body parts , and cooking terminology . also included is a list of just over 200 items of "" basic vocabulary , "" which seems to correspond to the so-called swadesh list . linguists interested in historical linguistics and language classification will be grateful to find this set of words conveniently collected together . setting aside some minor qualifications , as a reference work on turkish for linguists , turkish has no equal . it is more comprehensive , more up to date , and more effectively organized than any other description of the language . the method of organization , as well as the detailed table of contents and the index , make a wealth of information available almost instantaneously . it is , simply put , an admirable reference work on turkish for linguists . the same can not be said about the utility of turkish for non-linguists . there are two main reasons why the book will not be accessible to non-linguistic audiences . first , kornfilt assumes familiarity with linguistic terminology . in the very first paragraph on page 1 , for example , she uses the terms ' nominalized clause ' and ' constituent clause , ' neither of which is likely to be familiar to non-linguists . second , turkish presupposes an interest in and a knowledge of certain linguistic questions . kornfilt has little to say , for example , about questions of stylistic variation , formal versus colloquial speech , or any of a range of topics that the typical student or scholar of turkish might be interested in . this is not really a criticism , since the descriptive grammar series has a well defined audience that excludes non-linguists . nevertheless , it is unfortunate that the grammar will not be useful to a wider audience . it will supplement but will not replace lewis ( 1976 ) and underhill ( 1976 ) . i have just two complaints about turkish . first , there is a relatively large number of errors and inconsistencies . most are minor and consist of missing ' - s 's on verbs , using ' of ' for ' or , ' etc . , but some will cause confusion . on page 27 , for example , turkish is described as a 's ubject-verb - object language . ' ( it is actually s - o - v . ) a sentence on page 30 , which addresses the of question whether pied-piping of postpositions is obligatory , leaves the reader unsure of the answer . there are also some contradictions . on page 142 , the claim is made that the reflexive can never occur in subject position , but on page 305 we learn that the reflexive can occur as an honorific subject and on page 542 three references are given to works that discuss reflexive subjects in subordinate clauses . other inconsistencies are found in the bibliography , where some turkish titles are translated into english and others are not . the author is aware of some of the errors and has prepared an addendum which contains a short list of errata , but many of the errors that i found are not included . the addendum is available free of charge from the author or the publisher . my other complaint concerns the cost of turkish . at us $ 180 , the grammar is unlikely to find its way into many private libraries . this is unfortunate ; since the book is so useful , linguists interested in turkish will want to have it close at hand . references lewis , g . l .

Posted on Thu, Jul. 25, 2002Copyright Law Thwarts Open Source Confab Demo
Posted by Dan Gillmor
Bruce Perens was going to demonstrate a modified DVD player at this week's
Open Source gathering in San Diego. He'd planned to show (Infoworld) how a
DVD player with its regional coding disabled could play DVDs with
different regional codes.Perens was going to do this in violation, he believed, of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, which bans the circumvention of technological
methods to protect copyrighted material from uses the owner doesn't want.
And the possibility of legal trouble led his employer, Hewlett-Packard, to
ask him not to do the demonstration.HP funds Perens to pursue a variety of free software projects. He was
willing to take the legal risks himself, he told me today, but HP worried
that it would be ""a more juicy target,"" the kind of deep pockets that
might make the entertainment cartel drool. In that context it's
understandable why HP would be concerned, though I wish the company would
take a stand on the right side of this issue.So while Perens is going to talk about the DMCA's pernicious impact on
things like free software, he's not going to give his demonstration. A
shame, but that's how things are going these days.Hollywood is winning, folks. You are losing. And you'd better start caringhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

( 1b ) above ] . lrules ( or norms-of - language qua institutional or cultural facts ) are typically learned or acquired by experience . but some norms are so deeply rooted in human nature that their violation is more or less unnatural and requires an extra effort . ( this is one of the basic tenets of stampean natural phonology , unless i ' m mistaken . ) for example , anyone standing on two hands ( instead of two legs ) in a cocktail party would certainly violate a norm of socially correct behaviour . in this case , the ' two-leg ' constraint is almost vacuously a norm , because it would be hard to violate it . in the same vein , the lrule of which ( 2a ) is an exemplification , is almost vacuously a norm , because only a linguistic professional could violate it by producing ( 2b ) . but it is a norm , nonetheless . > and what merit is there to making such a distinction > at all ? this distinction is ( meta ) descriptive of generative grammarians ' actual practice . martti nyman , dept of general linguistics , univ of helsinki , finland",Safe Email

"anyone to fully bury global warming, they would have to bury the Greens. A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn't existed they would have had to invent it. So it is with global warming. Their fundamental opposition isn't to a warmer earth, it is to industrial civilization.The fact that the sattelites didn't match what the global warming theorists said should be there is old news. The news here is that the temperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have been validated with a different means of measurement.Rather than have to defend CO2 concentrations as not causing global warming, people who believe in CO2 need a good explanation of the ""Medieval Warm Period"". Said period was warmer than what we have now, and it obvioiusly wasn't caused by CO2.In point of fact the predicted global warming due to CO2 is not caused DIRECTLY by CO2. CO2 doesn't trap that much heat. Water vapor does, and if you can get more water vapor in the air due to CO2 then you have your warming theory.Yet it would seem that the very stability of the earth's climate over long periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback loops but one where negative feedback loops predominate.More water vapor can increase temperatuers, but that also leads to more clouds. Clouds both trap heat and reflect it, so it depends a great deal on how the cloud formation shakes out. Most climate models admit they do clouds very poorly.A good link is: http://www.techcentralstation.be/2051/wrapper.jsp?PID=2051-100&CID=2051- 060302A > -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Jim > Whitehead > Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 12:23 PM > To: Robert Harley; fork@spamassassin.taint.org > Subject: RE: Goodbye Global Warming > > > Gary Lawrence Murphy wrote: > > >and say hello to the cool: Oooo ... /this/ is going to cause > > some stir ... > > > > Of course not.

> Is it safe to conclude that avoiding any cleverness with headers is a
> good thing?Since I don't know what you did, exactly, I can't guess.  What you seemed to
show is that you did *something* clever with headers and that doing so
helped (the ""after"" numbers are better than the ""before"" numbers, right?).
Assuming that what you did was override what's now
tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers with some other routine, and didn't
call the base Tokenizer.tokenize_headers at all, then you're missing
carefully tested treatment of just a few header fields, but adding many
dozens of other header fields.  There's no question that adding more header
fields should help; tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers doesn't do so only
because my testing corpora are such that I can't add more headers without
getting major benefits for bogus reasons.Apart from all that, you said you're skipping Received.  By several
accounts, that may be the most valuable of all the header fields.  I'm
(meaning tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers) skipping them too for the
reason explained above.  Offline a week or two ago, Neil Schemenauer
reported good results from this scheme:    ip_re = re.compile(r'(\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})')    for header in msg.get_all(""received"", ()):
        for ip in ip_re.findall(header):
            parts = ip.split(""."")
            for n in range(1, 5):
                yield 'received:' + '.'.join(parts[:n])This makes a lot of sense to me; I just checked it in, but left it disabled

How to Publish Your Windows XP FTP Server to the Internet
Several of you wrote in about last week's article on installing an FTP Server. You said ""that was great, but you only told half the story"". You wanted to know two more things:How to make the FTP Server available to Internet users
How to secure the FTP ServerThere are several ways to make an FTP server on the internal network available to users on the Internet. These methods are referred to as ""Server Publishing"". You can use a Windows XP computer running Internet Connection Services (ICS) to publish a server on your internal network.Let's take a look at a common scenario. You have a Windows XP computer connected to the Internet with an always-on cable or DSL connection. You have another computer on your private network also running Windows XP. You've installed the FTP Server on this internal network computer and put files into the FTP folder. Now you want Internet users to connect to the FTP Server through the ICS computer directly connected to the Internet.You can do this with the Windows XP ICS! Here's how:Go into the Network Connections window. You can get there from the Network applet in the Control Panel.
Right click the network interface directly connected to the Internet and click Properties.
Click on the Advanced tab in the connection's Properties dialog box. Put a checkmark in the Internet Connection Firewall checkbox. Always make sure the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled when you connect a computer directly to the Internet.
Click the Settings button, then click on the Services tab in the Advanced Settings dialog box.
Now click the Add button. This brings up the Service Settings dialog box. Type in My FTP Server in the Description of service text box. In the Name or IP address text box, type in the IP address of the computer on your private network that's running the FTP server. Since you're using ICS, it'll have an IP address like 192.168.0.x, where x is different for each machine on your network. You might want to manually assign the IP address the FTP Server already has, so that it doesn't change in the future. You can find out what IP address your FTP server is using by opening a command prompt at the FTP server and typing in the command ipconfig. That will give you the IP address the FTP Server is using. Back to the Service Settings dialog box, select the TCP option button. For the External Port and the Internet port, put in the port number you assigned to the FTP server on your internal network. Read this week's How To section to see how to change the listening port number. Clic!
k OK
Click OK, and then click OK one more time! You might need to disable and enable the adapter after making the change. You can do that by right clicking the always-on interface.The procedure is very similar for dial-up connections. However, there are problems with dial-up connections (and many always-on connections) because the IP address on the external interface of the ICS computer changes over time. Next week I'll share with you a cool way you can get around this problem by using something called a ""dynamic DNS service"". I've used one for years, and it works great. Make sure to tune in next week for the details.There you have it. Is server publishing in your future? Have any questions on the method I described above? If so, let me know! There are lots of ways you can publish services. Tell me how you do it, and tricks you've learned along the way. If you're having problems with server publishing, let me know about those too! I'll be sure to include what I learn from you in upcoming newsletters.Until next week,

Allow Dial-up Connections to Synchronize Time with Internet Time Servers
Do you use a dial-up connection but can't get your machine to synchronize its clock with an Internet time server when the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled? If so, here's a tip Richard Surry sent in on how to fix the problem:Open your Network Connections window from the start menu.
Right click on your modem (or other dial-up connection) and click Properties.
Click on the Advanced tab. You already have a checkmark in the box that enables the ICF. Click on the Settings button.
Click on the Services tab, then click on the Add button in the Services tab.
That should open the Service Settings dialog box. In the Description box, put in Internet Time Service. For the Name or IP address of the computer hosting this service on your network, type in 127.0.0.1. Select the TCP  protocol option button. For both the external and internal port numbers, type 123.
If you're online, disconnect and reconnect. Now synchronize the time by double click on the clock in the system tray and going to the Internet Time tab.This is an interesting tip, and it represents an even more interesting problem. For you network geeks out there, I'll ask you this question: Why should we allow unsolicited inbound connections for the Internet Time Service? The ICF should not block responses to solicited outbound connections, so why should we have to enable reverse NAT to make this work?

How to Secure an FTP Server on Windows XP Professional
Last week we went over how to install the Windows XP FTP Server. It will work fine after going through the steps outlined last week, but several of you asked for more information on how to secure the FTP Server because you wanted to connect it to the Internet. It's a very good idea to understand how FTP security works before putting the server on the Internet. Here are some suggestions:Open the Internet Information Services console from the Administrative Tools menu. In the left pane of the console, expand your server name and then expand the FTP Sites node.
Right click on the Default FTP Site and click the Properties command.
Click on the FTP Site tab. Notice that the default TCP Port is set to 21. This is the well-known port for FTP. You can increase security a bit by changing this port to another value that's in the 1026-65534 range. This secures it from poorly motivated click-kiddies and also allows you to get around your ISP blocking incoming connections to TCP port 21. Friends who connect to your FTP server will need to change the port number on their FTP client software as well.
The Windows XP FTP server has a hard coded limit of 10 simultaneous connections. You might want to change this to a lower number to reduce the chance of a LAN party on the external interface of the FTP server.
Put a checkmark in the Enable Logging checkbox. Click the Properties button to the right of the log format drop-down list box. Click the Daily option button on the General Properties tab. On the Extended Properties tab, select all of the Extended Properties. Click OK.
Click on the Security Accounts tab. Place a checkmark in the Allow only anonymous connections checkbox. This prevents users from sending username and password credentials to the FTP server. You don't want users to send credentials because those credentials are sent in ""clear text"", which can be read by anyone who's listening on the wire.
Click the Messages tab. Enter a Welcome message, an Exit message, and a message users will see if there are no available connections.
Click on the Home Directory tab. Make sure there is a checkmark in the Read and Log Visits checkboxes. REMOVE the checkmark in the Write checkbox. Note the location in the Local Path text box. Navigate to that path in the Windows Explorer.
Right click on the FTPROOT folder and click Properties.
Click on the Security tab. Make sure that SYSTEM has Full Control. Assign the IUSR_ account READ access only. Remove all other permissions for the IUSR account. Make sure you give Adminstrators Full Control tool. This allows you, the administrator on the FTP Server computer, to add, remove and change files in the FTPROOT folder.Stop and restart the FTP Server. Now your FTP server is secure and Internet bad guys won't be able to use it to distribute porno and bootlegged software.

Cumulative Patch for Windows Media Player
I think it was a couple months ago when I wrote about some serious problems with the Windows Media Player (WMP). At that time you could download a ""cumulative"" patch that would update the Media Player with the latest security fixes. Well, it's time to download another ""cumulative"" patch! A couple other problems were found in WMP that could cause some problems. To read more about the problem head on over to:
http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709SE-WMP_PatchYou'll also find the download locations for Windows Media Player versions 6.4, 7.1 and 8.0 (XP) on that page.
Cumulative Patches for Excel and Word for Windows
If you run Microsoft Word or Excel, versions 2000 or 2002 (XP), then you need to head on over to the Microsoft site to download some security fixes. These fixes handle security glitches that could get you in trouble if you don't take care of them! Head on over to Microsoft's site where you can find individual fixes for each program. You only need download the fix that applies to your computer:

A Computer May Hang During a Heavy Load with an Ericsson HIS Modem
If your computer has a Ericsson HIS modem, you might experience a dreaded blue screen and see the message IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL. The problem is that you're downloading too much and your poor modem can't keep up! Microsoft recognizes that this isn't a problem with the modem, but with the modem driver. To download a fix visit Microsoft's site. After getting the fix, you can download as much as you like without worrying about blue screens!
http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709UP-HIS_Modem
Knowledge Base Search Center - If it is Not Broke, Do Not Break it!
It wasn't so long ago when you could search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for articles that came up in the last 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days and 6 months. It was great! But Microsoft decided to ""fix"" the Knowledge Base search page, and now it really sucks! It's hard to find things that used to come up easily, the site is often down, and searching based on age of articles just doesn't work anymore.Try this: go to:
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?ln=EN-US&pr=kbinfo&
and on the left side of the page select Windows XP in the top drop down list box. Don't put anything in the For solutions containing...(optional) text box. Leave the Any of the words entered option selected in the Using drop down list box. For Maximum Age select 3 days. For Results Limit select 150 articles. Click Search Now. Whoa! Nothing. OK, it's reasonable to see no articles related to Windows XP in the last 3 days. Try again, this time using 7 days. Whaat? Still no articles. OK, it was a holiday week in the USA last week. Let's try 14 days. Nothing again! That seems sort of strange, doesn't it? Let's give it another try with 30 days. Still no articles! What's going on here? Keep trying for 6 months and one year. You still won't find anything. It's pretty sad, because this used to work.

A Description of the Repair Option on a Local Area Network or High-Speed Internet Connection
Here's the answer to a question I've had for a long time. What the heck does that ""Repair"" option for a network connection actually do? It's not in the help file, but it's on the Microsoft Web site. Here's what it does:Sends an ipconfig /renew
Flushes the ARP cache with a arp -d
Reloads the NetBIOS name cache with a nbtstat -R
Updates its WINS server with an nbtstat -RR
Clear out the DNS client cache with an ipconfig /flushdns
Reregisters the client with a DDNS server with a ipconfig /registerdnsCheck out the original article over at:

Keyboard and Mouse Do Not Work When You Start Windows
Have you been hit with this one? You're working in Windows XP and shut down for the day. The next morning you start up your Windows XP computer and the mouse pointer is stuck! The only way to get it going again is to restart the computer, and for some reason the pointer starts moving again. What's up with that? I still haven't figured that one out, but Microsoft has a KB article that claims it's from a corrupt registry. I doubt that's the case in my situation because the problem is intermittent. But if you find that your mouse is always stuck, you might want to check out:

Lagos, Nigeria.
23rd July 2002
Attention President/C.E.O
                   
Dear Sir,REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.Firstly I must solicit your strictest confidence in this subject. This is by virtue of its nature as 
being utterly confidential and top secret. A member of the Nigeria Export Promotion Council 
(N.E.P.C.) who was part of the federal government delegation to your country during a trade 
exhibition gave your particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential operation with 
you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all the parties and 
hope that you keep it top secret because of the nature of the business.Within the ministry of petroleum resources where I work as a director of engineering and 
projects, and with the co-operation of four other very top officials, we have under our 
control as overdue contract payments, bills totaling Thirty One Million United States Dollars, 
which we want to transfer to a foreign account, with the assistance and co-operation of a 
foreign company to receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign individual 
account to receive the funds.The source of the fund is as follows: during the last military government here in Nigeria 
which lasted bout eleven months, government officials set up companies and awarded 
themselves various contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries.  The 
present civilian government is not aware of the atrocities committed by their predecessors 
and as a result, we have a lot of such over invoiced contract payment s pending which we 
have identified floating at the central bank of Nigeria ready for payment.  However by virtue 
of our position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this money in our names.  I was 
therefore delegated as a matter of urgency by my colleagues to look for an over seas 
partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of  US$31,000,000.00 (THIRTY 
ONE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) hence we are writing you this letter. the present civilian government is determined to pay foreign contractors l debts owed 
so as to maintain an amiable relationship with foreign governments and non-government 
financial agencies.  We have decided to include our bills for approval with the co-operation 
of some officials of the federal ministry of finance (F.M.F) and the central bank of Nigeria 
(C.B.N).  We are seeking your assistance in providing us with a good company account or 
any other offshore bank account into which we can remit this money by acting our main 
partner and trustee or acting as the original contractor.  This we can do by swapping of 
account information and changing of beneficiary and other pertinent information to apply for 
payment.  By this act, we would be using your company information to apply for payment, 
and prepare letters of claim and job description on behalf of your company.  This process 
would be an internal arrangement with the departments concerned.I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist 
us in this transaction, your share as compensation will be us$6.2 million (20%), us$21.7 
million (70%) for us and us$3.1 (10%) for 
taxation and miscellaneous expenses.The business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and 
confidentiality.  Also your area of specialization is not m hindrance to the successful 
execution of this transaction.  I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will 
not disappoint me. I will bring the complete picture of the transaction to your 
knowledge when I have heard from you.Thanks for your co-operation,Yours faithfully,Dr. Kataga BakoriNB: Please respond by sending a facsimile (Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1

"acceleration for SSL makes sense since PKI can slow down a transaction by as much as 1,000-fold. Per this article, XML formatting only increases doc size by about 20-fold.. I'm not sure there are enough ""powers of ten"" in there to justify hardware acceleration. Expect the next major release from DataPower to be the revolutionary new ""email chip"" - allows you to offload the sending and receiving of email messages onto dedicated hardware while you get on w/ more important things .. like listening to MP3s..Best, Paul Sholtz-----Original Message----- From: Rohit Khare To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org Sent: 8/27/02 3:00 PM Subject: DataPower announces XML-in-siliconNo analysis yet... don't know what to make of it yet. But here's the rawbits for all to peruse and check out what's really going on... Best, Rohit===========================================================DataPower delivers XML acceleration device ByÂ Scott Tyler Shafer August 27, 2002 5:46 am PTDATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, according to company officials.The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in afamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. TheDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML data.According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two businesses.""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. ""The XA35 is the first of a family.""Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size upto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best alternative.In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount importance in the world of XML.""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. Firewalls are blind to XML today.""Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the companyitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes will be mostly false. Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytesand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection ofXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device.The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an applicationco-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device.DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch inMay, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a focus on content processing and acceleration. The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in field trails at a number of other enterprises.======================================================================== =DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3â„¢), the industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.Today, XG3â„¢ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions ofproducts, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, providing an immediate return on technology investments to industry-leading customers and partners.DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.======================================================================== =DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in FundingVenrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneerin XML-Aware Networking for Web ServicesCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPowerâ€™s Board of Directors.DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing andsales of the companyâ€™s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking.Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the worldâ€™s first intelligent XML networkingÂ devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactionsat the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPowerâ€™s solutions are based on its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3â„¢) technology.""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. DataPowerâ€™s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of XML that is required to support next generation enterprise applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower Technology.""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML thatâ€™s critical to Webservices projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A singleDataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 serversâ€”breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require laser-focused scrutiny. DataPowerâ€™s patent-pending technology addresses a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with DataPowerâ€™s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering performance and security pitfalls.""""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidlygrowing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is ontheir third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML Generation Three (XG3)Â technology was quite simply the single most compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPowerâ€™s XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that relyon XML for mission critical applications.""About Venrock Associates Venrock Associates was founded as the venture capital arm of the Rockefeller Family and continues a tradition of funding entrepreneurs that now spans over seven decades.

"Paul, my apologies for being irritable on the subject.  I'll tone down
the rhetoric.Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):> Indeed - that I actually had understood prior to all this - for
> example commercial entities with trial/limited/crippled editions. 
> 
> Which is no problem - I don't see why that should be a problem for
> SuSE though - surely the more the merrrier as far as they're
> concerned.Anything either you or I have to say about their motivation is
speculation.  Bearing that disclaimer in mind, here's mine:  They make
money from selling boxed sets.  They're glad to make some versions
available for almost-unrestricted distribution (not ""for value"") via CD
duplication or the Internet that they estimate won't substitute for
boxed-set sales.For example, they _could_ have packaged what I call the ""FTP edition"" 
in ISO9660 images.  The fact that they didn't suggests to me that they
see the inconvenience of mirroring FTP Edition i386 files (which, at the
moment, are v. 8.0) as motivation for all but the really determined to
buy boxed sets, instead.  Likewise, they _could_ release a v. 8.0 (current) version of the
""evaluation"" single-disk ISO image.  Instead, they always keep it
several versions behind.  This again seems like an incentive to buy a
boxed set, after ""evaluating"" SuSE via the ISO image.Again, the above is my speculation (only) about their motivations.  All
we know of a certainty is what permissions they've granted, which are a
bit messy and complex, but nonetheless quite clear.Those permissions, as a reminder, apply to the SuSE-produced components,
YaST, YaST2, the distribution installer program, and possibly other
utilities that I don't know of.  _They_ wrote that code, and have every
right to grant or withhold permissions as suit them best.> One can suspect what one likes. What I didn't understand was that SuSE
> had proprietary extensions that it wasn't prepared to allow people to
> use under the GPL or even under  a FreeBSD style licence.Hmm, let's slow down, here:  There's a persistent misconception that
it's possible to place somebody else's work under a new licence without
his permission.  Not so.  There is nothing in copyright law that would
make that possible.The copyright _owner_ has inherent rights in his (e.g., software) work,
and is entitled to issue as many _instances_ of his code under diverse
licences as he wishes.  (If he gives you a copy with no licence
statement, there's effectively a default licence by operation of
copyright law.  To avoid going into a long digression, let me just say
that it's a proprietary licence by default.  That's why, in order to
have open source software at all, there must be an explicit licence
from the copyright holder.)No Linux distribution _ever_ entails relicensing people's software
without their explicit permission -- since no such relicensing can occur
at all. 
 
You cannot get away with taking SuSE Linux AG's work and redistributing
it under what you claim to be a BSD licence, or the GPL, or anything at
all other than what the copyright owner has specified, because you
simply lack the right to do so.  Claiming to do it would be copyright
violation.> I thought that the model for the likes of SuSE was selling support and

contributors) had intended to prohibit putting GPLed works on the same
CDs as proprietary ones, and selling the result only via retail stores
(plus mail order, etc.) in shrink-wrapped boxes, I'm 100% certain they
could and would have done so.Guess what?  They did not.  They didn't even require that anybody give
you copies of the GPLed components, ever, at all.  All they did was
require that _if_ you received GPLed software lawfully, then you had to 
be able to get matching source code for a limited period, upon request.Spirit of the GPL, you say?  I'd suggest that Stallman and company knew
exactly what they were doing, and that the degree of access to GPLed
software is exactly what they had in mind.
 
> All I want is the OS and GNU apps. I was under the impression that for

> 
> Ai-je tort?Mais si.You are indeed under a misconception, and may want to read the text of
the GPL to verify this fact.  The GPL does _not_ entitle you to a copy
of any binary software.  Section 2 provides for rights to access to
matching source code _if_ you have lawfully received a copy of a covered
binary.  That section provides three alternative mechanisms for the
distributor to provide such access.  And SuSE _do_ actually provide 
exactly that access.Or so I think to be the case.  If you believe there's some GPLed
codebase that you can lawfully receive from SuSE whose matching source
code they are not making available exactly as required, please tell us
which codebase that is.  (That would be SuSE Linux AG's headache, not
any of ours, but it might be interesting to examine.)> My understanding was that binaries or whatever could be received for

provisions of the GPL concern access to _source code_, not binaries.
(2) It kicks in _only_ for people who've lawfully received covered
binaries.  (3) _Covered_ software means instances of codebases actually
placed under the GNU GPL by their copyright owners.  The mere act of 
placing a piece of software on a CD-ROM with GPLed software doesn't GPL
it.In fact, the assertion to the contrary is a favourite FUD tactic from
enemies of Linux:  They're forever trying to convince software producers
that using GPLed software in any way with their proprietary offerings
will ""taint"" their copyrights and force them to put their property under
the GPL.  It's simply not so.> If I wanted support from SuSE, that would be a different issue, and
> one for which I would be willing to pay.That's nice, but they're not _offering_ the exact contents of the boxed
sets free of charge and lawful to duplicate & redistribute, or ""borrow"".
For one thing, as you will have noticed from my earlier listing of
components, the boxed sets' CD-ROMs include quite a lot of _third-party_
proprietary software.  SuSE Linux AG _cannot_ allow you (or your friend)
to hand out copies of that software freely, because it's not theirs in
the first place.
 
> I have a friend with 7.3 - I think that I'll end up doing that!If you mean the 3-CD core set of RH 7.3, good.  It's a quite decent
distribution.  But bear in mind that the RH 7.3 boxed sets include
some other third-party applications whose owners would be very upset to
find them being copied or ""borrowed"". > I have now realised this, thanks to your kind explanations. I can
> borrow them, but not copy them? No.Look, it's a collection of software, many elements of which may not be
lawfully just given out to multiple people:  Your friend installing it,
then _not_ erasing it but merely letting you ""borrow"" the CDs results in
the product being installed in multiple places.  That's unauthorised
copying.> And, as I've tried to explain, is not the licence terms on, say,
> trials for commercial company x to which I object, it is the way SuSE
> appears, at least to my I.T. peasant self, to have mixed up
> proprietary and open stuff.Well, if you don't like SuSE, then you probably won't like Caldera
eDesk, Xandros Desktop, Lycoris Deskop LX, Libranet, Lindows, or KRUD,
either.  Depending on your criteria, you also might not like Red Hat,
Linux-Mandrake, or Yellow Dog, since all of those have boxed-set retail
sets that include CD-ROMs that may not be publicly redistributed.
 
(I don't even use SuSE.  I'm just trying to clarify the licensing
question.)-- 
Cheers,                                             Live Faust, die Jung.

"judgment fatigue : summary , part i summary of responses to request for information on judgment fatigue ( also called syntactic satiation ) original post : linguist list : vol-6 - 974 . mon jul 17 1995 . issn : 1068-4875 . special thanks to the following respondents : kimberly barskaitiki , tim beasley , elizabeth bergman , michael bernstein , vivian cook , joseph davis , rianne doeleman , karen emmorey , suzette haden elgin , ted harding , stephen helmreich , erika l . konrad , john e . limber , bruce nevin , john robert ross , carson t schutze , linda shockey , william snyder , karin stromswold , joyce tang boyland , anyone i may have missed , and anyone who thought about responding but has n't yet . karin stromswold and william snyder have actually investigated this phenomenon . i have not read either of their papers yet , but i look forward to doing so . william snyder ( snyder @ psyche . mit . edu ) presented a poster on this topic at lsa 1994 , which was mentioned in rick hudson 's summary post of july 29 , 1994 . individual 's interested in dr . snyder 's poster should contact him directly . hudson 's post ( linguist list : vol-5 - 855 . fri 29 jul 1994 . issn : 1068-4875 . ) summarized the literature available which addresses the difference between linguists ' and non-linguists ' intuitions . hudson also mentions ( but does not cite ) four references provided by joyce tang boyland regarding satiation effects ( both syntactic and semantic ) . hudson 's original post is available from linguist list archives . joyce tang boyland 's response is included below ( in part ii of post , following ) . karin stromswold 's response ( karin @ muddle . rutgers . edu ) was my connection to snyder , hudson , and boyland . her post is most relevant to my original query and is included in its entirety below ( in part ii of post , following ) . most responses mentioned the influence of continual or repeated exposure over a period of time , either mentioning examples similar to perceptual or semantic satiation such as a word-repetition effect . ( bergman , cook , davis , doeleman , haden elgin , harding , helmreich , limber , schutze , snyder , stromswold , tang boyland ) . there are many differences , however , between the effects of semantic satiation and "" syntactic satiation "" or judgment fatigue : first , semantic satiation is the detachment of form and meaning which occurs as you continuously repeat some lexical item ( see also stromswold 's post below ) . judgment fatigue , in contrast , cannot be induced by the repeated presentation of any sentence . in fact , published experiments by nagata show that raters ' intuitions only become more stringent on repeated presentation . second , the loss of the meaning of a sentence is not an effect of judgment fatigue . the meaning of the sentence may be quite lucid to the individual reading it , but that individual 's attention is focused upon some aspect of the grammatical acceptability of the sentence , and it is the ability to judge grammatical acceptability which is lost , not the ability to make sense of the utterance . third , while the particular characteristics of the stimuli which induce judgment fatigue are not yet fully established , it appears that different types of sentences induce the effect to different degrees ( stromswold , snyder as cited in hudson 's post ) . this is not the case for semantic satiation , where the repetition of any lexical item can induce the effect . fourth , the "" scanting out "" effect as noted by haj ross points out that the loss of intuition can be triggered by one single stimuli , not necessarily the repeated presentation of numerous stimuli ( relevant quote posted below ) . conversely , subjects can rate hundreds of stimuli on the basis of grammaticality , with no fatigue effect ( beyond boredom ) , even if the stimuli contain permutation of the same lexical items , be they open or closed class items . note that point four is definitely true in the case that the stimuli are all dichotomously "" great - - grammatical "" or "" horrible - - ungrammatical "" . there is a definite influence of marginality , an effect which , to date , i believe no one has explained . fifth , semantic satiation ( as well as perceptual fatigue effects ) is often attributed to some type of neurological fatigue at the cortical level . this could not be the ( only ) reason for judgment fatigue , however , because there may not be any single word or syntactic structure which is repeated in all of the stimuli ( such as could be the case for judgment fatigue induced by the scope of negation or negative polarity items ) . for this reason , it would be quite implausible to claim that judgment fatigue is the result of some type of physiological / chemical / neurological saturation which has occurred at the cortical level . at this point , i do not believe judgment fatigue and semantic satiation have much in common as behavioral disturbances . ( incidently , while i am not an expert on semantic satiation , i have not yet been forced by the evidence to believe that semantic satiation is the result of a low-level neurological fatigue . perceptual fatigue is a neurological phenomenon , but i attribute semantic satiation to other conceptual strategies . ) many linguists ( beasley , nevin , konrad , and one anonymous ) also observed ' that the longer you stay in linguistics , the less you speak english . ' to quote from bruce nevin 's response : < < a student was once asked , in my hearing , if a certain famous linguist was a native speaker of english . the reply : ' i think he used to be . ' > > hudson 's previous summation further confirms that linguists and non-linguists do demonstrate significantly different abilities in discriminating grammatical and ungrammatical sentences . this type of long-term "" drift "" of linguists ' judgments may be of interest in its own regard , but this type of "" judgment drift "" is not identical to the temporary loss of linguistic intuition which i intended to address . as noted by beasley and konrad , it may indeed be the case that exposure to second languages , exposure to dialects different from ones native dialect , or exposure to a large number of perhaps marginal sentences which occur rarely in natural spoken or written contexts ( such as sentences demonstrating violations of theoretical principals such as "" weak crossover "" or "" island constraints "" , for example ) may actually alter an individual 's criteria for grammatical acceptability . if one understands judgments of grammatical acceptability to be metalinguistic type-categorizations , then one may expect that an individual 's discriminative ability will be altered based upon that individual 's personal experiences with exemplars of the categories . others commented that judgment fatigue does not happen if the stimuli are contextualized ( davis , nevin ) or if the referential situation is more concrete rather than abstract ( davis , doeleman , nevin ) . this is not the case . a loss of linguistic intuition of grammatical acceptability definitely can happen spontaneously , such as while one is listening to a conversation or reading texts , regardless of the concreteness of the topic , with the following qualifications : judgment fatigue is inspired only by particular types of stimuli ( which have not yet been clearly defined , but see part ii of post , following ) and by the listener 's / reader 's focus upon the grammar of the utterance or sentence . other individuals related hard-to - comprehend sentences as examples inducing judgment fatigue . some such sentences , notably sentences involving scope ambiguity , may induce confusion , but confusion is not synonymous with the loss of ones own linguistic intuitions . for ambiguous or confusing stimuli , we say , "" someone should rewrite this sentence . it is ambiguous ( or anomalous ) . "" when we have judgment fatigue , we say , "" i ' m a monoglot , but damned if i can decide whether this sentence is grammatical . i sure do n't feel like a native english speaker ! "" lastly , some responses or general expressions of empathy or encouragement , and actual examples ( barskaitiki , emmorey , shockey ) . thank you again to all who responded . if you are interested in the current proposal for my experiments , or if you would like to hear more about the results and conclusions from the experiments when i am finished running them , please contact me . please see part ii ( posted separately ) for selected quotes from respondents .",Safe Email

This is something that often annoys me. Programmers can spend hours inlining
code and relying on optimisation tools to improve performance. The best
performance improvement can be obtained by fixing the algorithm.Most function calls get made very rarely. Optimising them often makes no
sense, produces illegable code and nonsense algorithms.Inlining will help in functions that get called frequently and are small -
such as string manipulation routines. But these are a small part of most
applications.One example I frequently see is people optimising a database function call.
Most database accesses involve many abstraction layers and millions of
instruction cycles. Trying to save a few instruction cycles would be a cost
saving of, say, 5 seconds in 20 hours.But a simple hashmap cache of common data without any compiler or inline
optimisations can turn that same 20 hours into 10 minutes.- Matthew (who really should be writing code)

completely transparent. The ratings and the feedback is there for all to
see. Most importantly it relies on the individual to make the decision for
themselves rather or not to trust a buyer/seller.Contrast this with TeS which utilizes ""sooper secret"" methodologies to
determine rather or not a submitter is trusted or not and at what point
something becomes spam at some level of ""confidence.""The unfortunate thing is that in my experience Razor is an incredibly
ineffective filter at this point. The spot checking I've done indicates about
a 40% hit rate. Submissions I made a week ago still don't count as spam,
apparently because I'm not trusted enough, or enough people haven't submitted
the item, or some unknown combination thereof. Why anyone would continue to
waste their time submitting items when they aren't being accepted due to
a series of calculations which will not be shared is beyond me.Any trust model that cannot survive public scrutiny isn't worth trusting IMHO./\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
