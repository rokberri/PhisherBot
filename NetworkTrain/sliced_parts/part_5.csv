"language maintenance and loss third international conference on maintenance and loss of minority languages koningshof conference center , veldhoven , the netherlands november 26 - november 27 , 1998 call for papers and registration introduction in line with the two previous international conferences on maintenance and loss of minority languages ( noordwijkerhout , the netherlands ; 1988 and 1992 ) , the aim of this conference is to bring together recent developments from various disciplines . the ambition of this third conference is to offer a major contribution to a theoretical discussion on the determinants of language shift and language loss , supported by the exchange of new research data . while the two preceding conferences concentrated mainly on the questions ` what is lost of the language ? ' ( structural-linguistic aspects ) and ` why does shift occur ? ' ( sociological and social-psychological explanatory factors ) , the veldhoven conference will focus on two questions ; ` why does shift occur ? ' and ` how is a language lost ? ' , i . e . , what are the psycholinguistic processes involved in language loss ? emphasis will be on the interaction between the process of transferring from the first to the second language and the gradual decline of skills in the first language , at the individual and group levels . the conference takes place on two consecutive days . plenary speakers are invited to make inspiring and thought-provoking remarks on the two conference themes outlined above , as well as on the broader theoretical framework . together with the contributions of the free paper presenters , the interaction between plenary speakers and participants forms the input for workshops and a round table discussion on the development of an integrated theoretical framework . this framework can then serve as a renewed starting point for continued research into language shift and loss in the new millennium . the organizing committee is also open to contributions from disciplines that have recently entered or touched upon the field and may shed a new light on the language change processes involved . the organizing committee will determine the best manner in which the results of the conference can be published . programme the conference will consist of three sections . the first section addresses the sociological and social-psychological explanatory context in which language shift processes take place . the second section deals with language attrition from a psycholinguistic perspective , and the third is fully devoted to the building of an integrated explanatory framework for processes of language shift and loss . in memory of willem fase , one of the initiators of the first and second conference on maintenance and loss of minority languages , who died in 1997 , a new forum called the willem fase lecture has been set up . this plenary lecture forum will be granted to a promising scholar , to be selected from the abstracts submitted . thursday , november 26 , 1998 section i : language shift from a sociological and social-psychological perspective 08 . 30-09 . 30 registration at koningshof conference center , veldhoven , the netherlands tea / coffee 09 . 30-10 . 00 conference opening 10 . 00-11 . 00 plenary session : lesley milroy 11 . 00-12 . 00 plenary session : richard bourhis 12 . 00-13 . 00 lunch 13 . 00-13 . 45 parallel sessions of free papers 13 . 45-14 . 30 parallel sessions 14 . 30-15 . 15 parallel sessions 15 . 15-15 . 30 closing session of section i 15 . 30-16 . 00 tea / coffee section ii : language loss from a psycholinguistic perspective 16 . 00-17 . 00 plenary session : kees de bot 17 . 00-17 . 45 parallel sessions 17 . 45-18 . 30 parallel sessions 19 . 00-20 . 30 dinner friday , november 27 , 1998 section ii continued : language loss from a psycholinguistic perspective 08 . 30-09 . 30 plenary session : joel walters 09 . 30-10 . 15 parallel sessions 10 . 15-10 . 30 closing session of section ii 10 . 30-11 . 00 tea / coffee 11 . 00-12 . 00 plenary session : willem fase lecture 12 . 00-13 . 00 lunch section iii : towards an integrated explanatory framework for processes of language shift and loss 13 . 00-15 . 00 preparatory workshops 15 . 00-15 . 30 tea / coffee 15 . 30-17 . 00 round table chaired by michael clyne 17 . 00-17 . 30 closing session of conference general information conference secretariat tilburg university research group on language and minorities c / o heleen strating -

Date: Not suppliedThe T-Mobile Sidekick -- the first commercial implementation of the wonderful 
Danger Hiptop PDA/phone -- is now onsale and the reviews are starting to 
appear. As soon as I'm in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I 
really think I'm going to pick this up.     That's partly because it costs less than half as much as its current 
    competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same 
    spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively 
    high- speed ""GPRS"" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious 
    surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice 
    time is another story -- more on that later.)     Another reason I like the Sidekick's prospects: It was designed for, and 
    will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing 
    hybrids focus on ""enterprise"" customers -- the big businesses that are 
    supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most 
    clearly don't at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their 
    own words, ""Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to 
    34-year-old demographic."" I am that demographic! Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Steve[3]!_)[1] http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/09/30/BU202936.DTL

if you ' re a first time user and would like to start using the pro version right away , the cost is $ 99 . 90 . for more info please visit our web site at : http : / / www . gaura . com / software / sys . htm to order order by fax visa or mastercard fax : ( 425 ) 379-9722 we will give you the address to download the program or for an extra $ 10 . 00 we ' ll send your the program on cd - rom name : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ address : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ city : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ state : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ zip : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ home phone : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ work phone : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ fax : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ e - mail _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ standard version $ 49 . 95 _ _ pro version $ 99 . 90 _ _ upgrade $ 49 . 95 ( from standard to pro , if you already have the standard version ) _ _ _ send cd - rom $ 10 . 00 _ _ _ provide download address . . no charge _ _ _ _ _ total visa _ _ _ mastercard _ _ _ _ account number : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ expiration date : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ i understand that all sales are final . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ signature - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -",Phishing Email

TROUBLESHOOTING VOICE | By Tom LancasterWhen you're troubleshooting voice calls, particularly the signaling,
it's often helpful to look at the detailed output of the device, be
it a voice-enabled router, telephony server, gateway or whatever. 
This detailed output can be in the form of logs or debug output as is
the case in Cisco's IOS.  In any case, this output is likely to be
somewhat cryptic.  One of the reasons is because this output often
uses a set of standardized codes and it is simply easier to put more
information on the screen using a short number than it is to write an
essay about why some event happened.Read the entire tip at:

VoIP ENABLE YOUR TELEPHONY | By Tom LancasterOne of the reasons VoIP has been slowly gaining traction is that
large enterprises have quite a lot of legacy equipment, and migrating
to VoIP from the circuit-switched networks of yore is no easy feat.
These environments are typically complicated and the stakes are high
because so many mission-critical systems rely on telephony.Click here for the full tip:

UNDERSTANDING RELAY | By Tom LancasterEveryone knows that delay is one of the two primary causes of poor
voice quality, particularly in VoIP networks, but where does this
delay come from?  Delay is generally defined as the time it takes
from the instant you speak into the phone until the instant that
sound is regenerated on the far end. Quite a few things have to
happen to transport this sound through the system, so delay actually
has many components.Read the entire tip here:

struct/object whatever you call your binary data. I agree this is the way
things will go, as XML parsing has just too much overhead to survive in the
application layer. So why turn it into XML in the first place? Becasue it

"linguistics in science fiction content - length : 3073 the postings on linguistics in science fiction for the past couple of months have been interesting , but curiously limited to comparing two types or genres of writing as if all that is going on with linguistics in science fiction these days is that some writers who are sf novelists have been injecting a few ' neat linguistic ideas ' into their narratives and some ( distinctly other ) group of writers who are linguists read these stories for fun and like to point out the borrowed ideas to other linguists . thats not all that 's happening these days folks . it seems to me that some of the most interesting things going on with linguistics in science fiction is in the blurring of these and other genres ( a general phenomena that george steiner argued was well underway 20 years ago in his _ after babel _ ) . it does n't take much digging through my library to come up with some examples of writers who ' ply the frames ' of sf in ways that deserve to be read by linguists ' for serious ' . samuel r . delany 's novels have been mentioned on the list , but he has also published two volumes of linguistic essays , _ the jewel - hinged jaw : notes on the language of science fiction _ 1977 . new york : dragon press . and _ starboard wine : more notes on the language of science fiction _ 1984 . new york : dragon press . richard rorty , probably known by many linguists interested in the philosophy of language ( from his writing on the ' linguistic turn ' in that field ) , tells a science fiction story about a mid-twenty - first century expedition to antipodea , a planet where the natives lack the concept of mind as part of his argument about ' persons without minds ' in _ philosophy and the mirror of nature _ 1980 . suzette haden elgin is a third writer ( and a linguist ) who writes about science fiction ' for serious ' . one medium in which she does this is the linguistics & science fiction network , which publishes a newsletter ( $ 10 annual membership fee ) out of the ozark center for language studies ( p . o . box 1137 , huntsville , ar 72740 e - mail : ocls @ sibylline . com . ) . i ' m sure that there are other such ' blurred genre ' pieces at the interface between science fiction and linguistic theory . i 'd encourage other subscribers to describe them here in addition to the usual novels and short stories ( the serious stuff can be read ' just for fun ' too . . . ) . paul gracie",Safe Email

dealing with this question without
dragging in the calculus:Suppose an atmosphere to be mainly
affected by gravity, resulting in
the potential energy for a mass M
to be linear in height h: Mgh.What relative concentrations will
we have when two different packets
of air are in equilibrium?If they are at the same height, we
will have half the mass in one, and
half the mass in the other, and the
amount flowing from one to the other
balances the amount flowing in the
opposite direction.[0]If they are at differing heights,
then a greater percentage of the
higher air tends to descend than
that percentage of the lower air
which ascends.  In order for the
two flows to balance, the higher
packet must contain less air than
the lower, and the mass balance
of the flows corresponds thusly:    high percentage of thin air
    ---------------------------
    low percentage of dense airNow, rates are exponential in
energy differences[1], so that
theoretically we should expect
an exponential decay in height,
to compensate.  How does it go
in practice?-Dave[0] How well does it balance?
    Chemical equilibria seem 
    stable, as they deal with
    very large numbers over a
    very long time.  Economic
    equilibria are viewed from
    the mayfly standpoint of
    individual people, and so,
    at best, the shot noise is
    very visible.[1] That is to say, rates will
    be exponential in the free
    energy differences between
    endpoints and a transition
    state.  We can ignore that
    complication in this model.

"Xander Blakley quotes a Russian joke in his terrific book _Siberia Bound_. 
Frenchman, American, and Russian get to talking bout which country has the 
more desireable women. Frenchman says, ""Ah, when a Frenchman puts his hands 
around zee waist of his lover, his fingers form a complete circle and 
touch--not because his hands are so large, but because zee  French woman's 
waist is so slender.""
    American says ""Yep, but when an American woman gets on a horse, her heels 
reach all the way down to the ground--and it's not because American horses 
are short, but because American women have such endlessly long, sexy legs.""
    Russian says: ""Da, but when a Russian slaps his wife's ass on his way out 
of the house in the morning, it's still jiggling when he comes back after 
work--and it's not because her ass is so big, but because the Russian work 
day is so short.""Tom

"Snoring problems? Let Snore

sleep!Â Â Â Â Â Â  1r
Is snoring
keeping you up all night? No
more sleepless nights with
Snore Eliminator!!

Do you know someone with a snoring problem? Snore Eliminator will help them
and they will love you for it.
Improve your sexual performance by reducing snoring and thus increasing
oxygen to your body!!People who snore have a higher risk of developing heart attacks, high blood
pressure, or strokes!! Snoring
also causes sleep disturbances that lead to increased anxiety,
hyperirritability, and decreased memory!
Individuals who snore have a 90% chance of daytime fatigue. Nine out of every
ten victims are male!How the Snore Eliminator will help you!What Causes Snoring?Over-relaxed throat and tongue muscles due to poor throat muscle
Excessive fat on the throat
Accumulation of secretion in the back of the throat and
Throat swelling from allergies and food
Heavy snoring is often associated with apnea, or the stopping
of breathing, during sleep. As
an individuals sleeps his or her sleeping pattern is disrupted and fragmented
due to snoring, thus they are never well rested. This can be a very hazardous
problem if someone is not getting proper REM sleep. Snoring is the audible
symptom of a blocked airway during sleep.The noise is caused by a vibration in the soft palate as the lungs pull hard
to take in a weakened current of incoming air. This blockage may result
from any number of circumstances, and these offer clues to get rid of the
problem.
Snoring is also more than likely to occur among people who sleep on their
backs; the tongue falls back toward the throat and partly closes the airway.The hidden dangers of snoring?
Snoring could increase the chances of a heart attack if not treated
Hypertension and increased anxiety are associated with snoring
Snoring causes sleep apnea a serious treatable medical conditionSnoring decreases sexual performance
by half, due to lack of oxygen
to the brain which decreases sexual responsiveness.
Most people who snore have a shortage
of oxygen for a
significant portion of that person's life. In recent studies, daytime fatigue
and cardiovascular disorder are related to snoring. In a few cases, heavy
snoring is a sign of potentially life -threatening problem. Sleep apnea in which
breathing stops for a second or even minutes at a time and finally resumes with
snorting and tossing around. This pattern may be repeated hundreds of times all
night long. The result is chronic oxygen shortage, which leads to abnormal heart
rhythms, high blood pressure, and heart strain.How the Snore Eliminator works!Snore Eliminator offers a unique break through with its all natural
enzymes which metabolize the
secretions, allowing the body to absorb them into the back of the throat. The
herbs reduce tissue swelling. The result is to open the airway and smooth the
airflow. This in turn eliminates the snoring for hours at a time. It also
reduces the noise made by
breathing through the mouth while sleeping.
By simply spraying the back of the throat, tongue and uvula with our special
formula, manufactured using our patented break through process, the soft tissue
is coated. This allows the throat
a chance to relax thus a
reduced amount of snoring. In most cases snoring is eliminated. Snore Eliminator
coats the throat area with a unique patented process of all natural lubricants.TESTIMONIALS from several of our satisfied customers:Lorenzo writes...
I am having a good nights sleep, finally. I used to wake myself up during the
night which was a real bummer as I would not always go back to sleep. Sleeping
through the night is great. Thanks a lot Snore Eliminator.
PS: My girlfriend loves it as much or more than I do.
Alex writes...
My husband uses it for another reason. He has a problem with blocked nasal
passages. While he's asleep the passages close, he stops breathing and he wakes
up gasping. When he takes Snore Eliminator his nose stays clearer and he's able
to sleep more restfully.
Thank you for a product that has really helped us!
Glen writes...
In February 1995, I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea. A CPAP was the
suggested treatment for my affliction, but it did not help my condition. I heard
your advertisement and ordered a bottle of Snore Eliminator and my sleep
improved immediately. I continue to use it and my sleep has been better than it
had been in years. Thanks.

"" on this same note , stavros macrakis states : "" if the provenance [ of the e - text ] is not clear , i do n't know why you 'd want to cite the thing in the first place ! if i give you a half-dozen xerox copies without the necessary bibliographic information , you would be wise not to rely on them too much !

"sum : nonreferential np 's in english a week or two ago , i sent the following query to the folks on linguist : > my interest is in identifying nonreferential np 's in written english so > that a computer natural lg processing system would know not to set up > referents for them to serve as antecedents for subsequent anaphora > resolution . compounds ( e . g . duck-shooting season ) can i suppose be > treated superficially as single words , but what about things like ' lose > faith in ' , ' catch sight of ' . of course , some criteria will involve > larger discourse issues , but it may be that it is possible to identify > at least some nonreferential np 's "" cheaply "" , i . e . just by looking > within a clause and / or considering inherent lexical semantics . my interest is also in examples like ' john is a teacher ' , where ' a teacher ' is not used to introduce a new discourse referent , but rather to characterize one which has already been introduced . my thanks to gregory ward , marion kee , and louise mcnally for their replies and comments . to summarize my investigations to date and the comments of these people : ward , gregory , richard sproat , and gail mckoon . 1991 ` ` a pragmatic analysis of so - called anaphoric islands , ' ' in language 67 : 439-474 . - - contrary to what i was assuming about compounds , subparts may serve as antecedents for pronominal anaphora . louise mcnally noted : ' first of all , it appears that languages with article systems ( like english and other germanic lgs . , and the romance lgs . ) mark "" nonreferentiality "" by the absence of an article ( i . e . via bare singular or , more commonly , bare plural nps ) . although such nps may function syntactically just like nps with articles ( in contrast to incorporated nominals ) , semantically and pragmatically they are quite distinct . . . in english things are complicated by the fact that bare plurals also appear to denote natural kinds , but this appears to be the [ exception rather ] than the rule ( bare nominals in the other languages i ' ve looked at do not have this interpretation ) . thus , what is shared by incorporated and non-incorporated , nonreferential nps is thus ( 1 ) the absence of an article ; and ( 2 ) their semantics / pragmatics . - - i would treat bare nominals as property denoting ( alternatively , as contributing only descriptive content ) , whereas i treat nps with articles as entity denoting ( alternatively , as contributing both descriptive content and , crucially , a discourse referent ) . quantificational nps are another matter altogether . there appear to be differences between the discourse anaphoric properties of nouns in compounds ( like "" baby-sitter "" ) and bare plurals that occur as independent elements in sentences . specifically , bare nominals are much more likely to felicitously license discourse anaphora to "" token "" entities ( as opposed to kinds ) than are nouns inside compounds . i have not investigated this in detail , but i suspect that the differences involve the sorts of existential inferences you get via the use of the compounds vs . full sentences ( for example , i can truthfully describe someone as a "" tomato grower "" at time _ t _ without there being any tomatoes that the person is growing at _ t _ ; in contrast , if it is true that fred grew tomatoes at _ t _ , there must have been tomatoes at _ t _ that he grew . - - this pair does n't do justice to the complexity of the problem , but i hope it gives you an idea of the differences one finds between the conditions on the applicability of nouns as descriptions and the truth of sentences . ) ' marion kee suggested marking phrasal verbs in the lexicon , for example ' catch sight of ' , where 's ight ' is non-referential . while this is an eminently practical solution to a thorny problem , my mandate is to explore methods for automatically identifying such non-referential uses , this being ( presumably ) more general , and computationally less expensive than searching the lexicon for given collocations . i am still musing on structural cues which might be used , perhaps in combination with semantic information . finally , i have attached a brief summary of the ' backgrounded object construction ' in roviana , a w . oceanic lg , spoken in the solomon islands . i am currently working on a sketch gr for an upcoming volume on oceanic lgs . the construction i am referring to would be called an antipassive by some ( roviana has morpho-syntactic ergativity with really unusual splits ) , ' i cooked the taro ' comes out as a transitive , with ' i ' having ergative ' marking ' ( actually , zero for ergative , which is one of the unusual things ) , and there is transitive morphology on the verb . constituent order vao ' i cooked taro ' / ' i did taro-cooking ' comes out as intransitive , with ' i ' marked as absolutive , and constituent order voa . no transitive morphology on the verb , and you could say that the o has ' moved into the verb phrase ' if you were inclined to use such dynamic metaphors , and could make a case for what a verb phrase was in roviana . i call this the ' backgrounded object construction ' . it is used in subordinate clauses , which do not have morpho-syntactic ergativity , and it does n't involve the marking of a as oblique , so i am not prepared to call it an antipassive . now : you use the backgrounded object construction ( i ) ( optionally ) for pragmatically backgrounding the undergoer in discourse ( coz it is not important ) or ( ii ) ( obligatorily ) if the undergoer is non-specific . by non-specific i mean that the speaker does n't have a particular ref in mind , even if one might be said to exist , e . g . ' i did taro-cooking ' implies taro exists , but you are not focusing on any particular taro . exception : if you are asserting the non-existence of an undergoer by using a prenominal modifier ' none / nothing ' , you can use the normal transitive construction . e . g . ' i did n't kill anyone ' ( there does not exist a person such that i killed them ) = transitive ' i did n't kill anyone ' ( denying the action , not asserting the non-existence of the referent ) = backgrounded object construction . thus : the transitive construction is used if the undergoer is ( a ) asserted to not exist or ( b ) specific and not pragmatically backgrounded . the backgrounded obj construction is used if the undergoer is ( b ) non-specific and not being asserted to not exist or ( b ) specific and pragmatically backgrounded . roviana has articles that mark information statuses like definite . the np in a backgrounded obj construction however can only be a bare noun . my thanks again to those who replied . any further thoughts / comments much appreciated . simon corston",Safe Email

I apologize for not catching up to the current code in so long.Now that I have I'm trying to resolve ""breakage"" and differences.The unseen window seems to have been replaced with the sequences 
window.  While I appreciate the flexibility of the sequences 
window, the unseen window filled an important-to-me need:  It 
was tiny and could be set to show on all desktops of a virtual 
window manager without taking a lot of space.  Since my normal 
mode of operation involves two copies of exmh displaying on a 
1024x768 vnc session, screen space is at a premium.As things stand now, I have a sequences window that shows a lot
more information than I need to have handy and takes up a lot 
more room than I can ""spare"".I can see that I could like the new sequences window a lot for 
certain operations.  But I'd like a nice uncluttered, tiny 
window that _only_ shows me info on my unread mail.One possibility that occurs to me would be a button or mouse
click that ""shrinks"" the Sequences window to show only the
sequences in the ""always show"" list.  And of course a way to 
expand it back.--Hal

are relaying spam through your qmail server, it's a fair bet that
you've seriously botched your qmail config (like forgetting to create
an rcpthosts file or something).Anyway, if you insist on using razor to resolve this problem, I
would suggest tossing qmail-scanner 
and SpamAssassin  into the mix as well.
The former provides the qmail-integration framework on which the latter
does its work (including razor-check invocations).Fair warning: It'll be far more resource-intensive than simply denying
relaying privileges to everyone except the folks you trust.  To find
out how to do that, go to  (which, incidentally,
should be your first stop for all things qmail) and search for ""qmail
newbie's guide to relaying"".- Adrian

DOLLARS ONLY) IN AN ACCOUNT THAT BELONGED TO ONE OF OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WHO 
DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY ON NOVEMBER 1994 IN A GHASTLY PLANE 
CRASH. SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING 
HIS NEXT-OF-KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM HIS MONEY BECAUSE WE CANNOT 
RELEASE IT UNLESS SOMEBODY APPLIED FOR IT AS NEXT-OF-KIN, OR RELATION TO 
THE DECEASED AS INDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDELINES. UNFORTUNATELY,

ACCOUNT: 60% TO MY COLLEAGUES AND I; FOR THE ROLE YOU WILL BE EXPECTED

Bounded transactions, like an ATM, enforce consistency
  by have some play with time and value
Most people keep inconsistent data in their heads, it's
  called congnitive dissonance theory
Most businesses keep inconsistent data, documents, tationale
  and ideas to support their work activities, it's called real life.I don't think it matters so much where it's located, i.e.
decentralization. I think that decentralization is the workaround
from technical limitations.  The fallout being that the only way
inconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by 
protecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries. 
The local information when combined with the technical
troubles of providing ""just enough"" forced synchronization
to remote information provide workable data consistenty, i.e.
enforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones when
concerns are more immedidate.  Tolerating temporary, irreconcilable deviations is how
people cope, otherwise you'd be like Nick Gatsby unnecessarily
pre-occupied with a spot of shaving cream on McKee's neck
who thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that the
whole world would be a little more perfect and everything,
including his pre-occupation with Daisy, would consistently

"http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/comment/0,7493,781769,00.htmlHamza's horrid - but we must tolerate himRod Liddle
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The GuardianSheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman
to scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing
with his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney.
I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on
statutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the
way home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the
sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,
and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen
for once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and
maybe me and you, too.
But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the
Bank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded
happy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic
proto-warriors in the background.
You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily
Mail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye
covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't
mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom
we don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come
off. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the
British right) as ""Captain Hook"", in articles which usually call for his
arrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe
off to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and
thus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if
we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him
to shut up.
Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before
September 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all
thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political
persecution.
And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've
got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory
manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of
context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But
perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and
tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's
scoop.
Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier
this year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his
allegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were
meant to do stuff like that.
He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been
frozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the
media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations
and the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly
- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be
true - Hamza is not ""representative"" of British Muslims, as if British
Muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could
turn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.
The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was
revealed to be rather more ""representative"" than the list of those
government-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -
dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism
and a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.
An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an
overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.
One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US
(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought
the war against terrorism was a war against Islam.
Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the
time, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at
home and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from
the liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US
foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action
against Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.
Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't
suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,
the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful
for the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.
Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has
been wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more
inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His
ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be
happy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for
example. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly
repellent.
And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire
to be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful
appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the
ruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.
Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that
are antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.
The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing
remotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution
is simply the pungency of his views.
It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his
rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This
is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.
You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And
if British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of
unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is
not because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man
up, therefore, won't make a difference.
It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:
The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.
But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.

FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX
IKOYI-LAGOS.ATTN:,                  First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of itÂ’s nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.
(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.
(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.

( of course , the morphology of romance languages is much better known than that of the languages of s . america , which also helps ! ) so if latin would be very imperfectly reconstructed , what hope is there for native american languages ? has anyone ever attempted , as an exercise in the comparative method , reconstruction of latin from the romance languages , then compared the results with the real thing ? or reconstruction of any other attested language from its descendents ?",Safe Email

"" the move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the houston energy - trading concern in the past 10 days . enron is the nation ' s largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades . yesterday , for example , enron was involved in about $ 4 billion of deals through its enrononline unit . since early last week , enron ' s share price has plummeted 50 % . last week , it reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $ 1 . 2 billion . it also disclosed that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was replaced wednesday . the draw - down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency , fitch , put enron on review for a possible downgrade , while another , standard it takes time to sell assets , particularly in today ' s slower economy . the company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies that have damaged its credibility , particularly in connection with its dealings with mr . fastow , the former chief financial officer . internal documents related to one of the fastow partnerships disclose that enron also did as much as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official , who has since left enron . while enron disclosed its fastow - related transactions in sec filings , a computerized search of the sec ' s database of public filings produced no reference to this other employee - related entity known as chewco . chewco was established in 1997 "" with approximately $ 400 million in capital commitments "" to buy an interest in enron assets , according to one of the partnerships documents . the document didn ' t further specify what assets were purchased , and it didn ' t disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either chewco or enron . chewco was being run by michael kopper , a managing director in enron ' s global equity markets group , according to the document . enron , which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with employee - related entities were legal and properly disclosed , didn ' t have any comment regarding its dealings with chewco . mr . kopper , who enron says left the company this year to focus on helping to run the fastow - related partnerships , didn ' t return phone calls . a person at his office in houston yesterday said mr . kopper was traveling . in response to questions about chewco , an enron spokesman would say only that "" michael kopper was never an executive officer of enron . "" mr . fastow repeatedly has declined interview requests . he severed his relationships with the partnerships in july . this statement is an apparent reference to sec disclosure regulations regarding related - party transactions . under sec rule s - k , a company has to report any transaction that exceeds $ 60 , 000 and involves "" any director or executive officer . "" by contrast , mr . fastow , as cfo , would have fallen into that category , but mr . kopper , as managing director of a business unit , presumably wouldn ' t have . however , reporting guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board seems to have a broader definition , one that might include mr . kopper . according to fas statement 57 , a related - party transaction involves a "" material "" piece of business between the company and a member of management . the statement defines management as directors , top officers , vice presidents in charge of major business units and "" other persons who perform similar policy - making functions . persons without formal titles may also be members of management .

' s bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy - trading powerhouse . not for long , some bond traders say . in trading yesterday , the houston company ' s five - year bond , a $ 250 million issue due in july 2006 carrying a coupon of 6 . 4 % , was quoted at 82 cents on the dollar , down from a bid of 88 late wednesday , and representing a 16 % drop during the past two weeks . that is far less than the 50 % decline in enron ' s stock price since the oct . 16 disclosure of a $ 1 . 01 billion charge linked to soured investments , resulting in a $ 618 million third - quarter loss . but the fall in the bond ' s price translates to a yield of 7 . 7 percentage points above bellwether u . s . government bonds , which is a widening from about three percentage points two weeks ago . although enron still is an investment - grade credit , that kind of "" spread "" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single b or lower . enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound , disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than $ 1 billion on its bank credit lines to shore up its finances . yet even as enron was tapping its lifeline , investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of enron bonds . yesterday ' s 82 bid , for instance , was for a block of less than $ 2 million in bonds , a small percentage of a typical trade . fueling the uncertainty surrounding enron were fears that credit - rating concerns will lower ratings on enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles , including losses , a securities and exchange commission investigation , and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer . "" even at these levels , there ' s very little buying interest , "" said harold rivkin , a principal at distressed - debt trader h . rivkin & co . in princeton , n . j . in one sign of the ripple effects , the price investors pay to protect themselves from losses on enron debt was surging . the cost of a "" default swap "" - - in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at face value in the event of default - - rose to 10 % of the size of the credit being insured . that was up from 8 % a day earlier , and more than holders of lucent technologies inc . debt had to pay at the height of that technology company ' s troubles earlier during the year . even with its woes , enron remains an investment - grade company . most credit - rating agencies rate enron ' s senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment - grade level . yet fitch said yesterday it put enron ' s credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade , following a similar move by moody ' s investors service last week . ( standard & poor ' s , a division of mcgraw hill cos . , stopped short of putting the company on its creditwatch list , opting instead to revise its long - term ratings outlook to "" negative , "" citing concerns about the company ' s financial flexibility . ) meanwhile , the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst . "" these are investment - grade bonds that are migrating toward distressed levels , "" said glenn reynolds , an analyst at credit sights inc . , an independent fixed - income research firm in new york . "" they aren ' t distressed yet , but they are headed in that direction . "" if enron ' s credit ratings fall , it would have implications far beyond the company ' s ability to raise money . for an energy trader , a credit downgrade sends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments . enron makes markets in a variety of commodities . though it is best known for trading electricity and natural gas , the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber , metals , bandwidth capacity and steel . as a market maker matching buyers and sellers , enron handles about a quarter of all the trading in the nation ' s energy and gas markets . enron ' s credit - worthiness is hugely important . the better its credit rating , the cheaper it can hedge , or offset , its positions in all these commodities markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers . without that credit rating , the cost of this high - margin , high - volume business starts to rise . a derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to , or derived from , that of an underlying security or asset , such as a stock , bond or commodity . "" even if the company does retain its investment - grade rating , the perception that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses , "" said mr . reynolds at credit sights inc . "" any prudent risk [ manager ] at enron ' s counterparties "" - - any institution on the other end of a financial agreement with enron - - "" is going to be examining their exposure to enron , and looking for ways to minimize it or offset it , "" mr . reynolds said . to be sure , enron , despite its recent woes , remains a strong company , credit analysts said . "" i don ' t think anyone ' s seriously thinking that this is a company that would ever default , "" mr . reynolds said . "" so far , our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are sticking with them , "" said ron barone , managing director of standard & poor ' s utility energy project finance group .

"" so is this a stock to avoid , in his view ? hardly . goldman on wednesday did bump enron off its "" u . s . select list , "" which consists of a few dozen top stock picks - - but mr . fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm ' s larger but prestigious "" recommended list "" of 200 or so favored stocks , where it has been since he joined goldman in 1993 . "" just because i can ' t be specific in being able to create a simple model . . . doesn ' t mean that you write off that industry and say ` i can ' t analyze it ' or ` i can ' t figure it out , ' "" says mr . fleischer , who owns an undisclosed number of enron shares . "" if that were the case , there would be an awful lot of industries we couldn ' t follow . "" enron ' s shares have dropped about 50 % since last week .

"" it was really a trust - me story , when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that level of trust . "" true , no stock picker is immune from bad calls . and wall street analysts long have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias , particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment - banking deals to be had . but enron stands apart , precisely because so many of the analysts still recommending the stock have acknowledged that the company ' s disclosure practices are lacking . which raises the question : how can an analyst recommend that others purchase a stock when key information about the company ' s operations is so often either unavailable or indecipherable ? concerns about the way that enron runs its business aren ' t new . many of the issues now plaguing enron ' s stock were first raised more than a year ago by bearish hedge - fund managers and independent accounting experts . yet time and again , wall street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the lingering questions about the company ' s various partnership transactions . besides those partnerships , enron also has been dogged by concerns about the secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings . through it all , most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock - market darling , publicly dismissing questions about the firm ' s accounting practices and level of disclosure . as of yesterday , of the 17 analysts who following the stock , 10 had a "" strong buy "" or equivalent rating on the stock , according to thomson financial / first call . five others rated the stock a "" buy , "" though not strongly . only prudential securities , which downgraded the stock this week , has a "" sell "" rating on enron . the bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high - profile examples of wall street taking a glass half - full stance , despite what in retrospect seems to be ample warning that a less - enthusiastic approach was warranted . over the past year in the wake of the nasdaq composite index ' s general collapse , analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence - - particularly those who , like goldman ' s mr . fleischer , own shares in the companies they cover . regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromised themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment - banking fees and other revenue . enron has spread the wealth across many wall street firms . for instance , for one $ 865 million equity offering in 1999 led by ` credit suisse first boston , enron retained seven co - managers , including donaldson lufkin & jenrette , lehman brothers and merrill lynch . "" enron is a big company , and i don ' t think you ' re going to find a firm that hasn ' t been involved , "" says credit suisse first boston analyst curt launer , who still rates the stock a "" strong buy "" with a $ 40 price target . "" they pay a lot of investment - banking fees to wall street . "" he adds , "" we do our analysis every day based on the information we have . are we here strictly to defend companies ? that ' s ludicrous . we ' re here to provide information to investors . . . . yes , i have the wrong recommendation on the stock . i don ' t think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has performed . "" mr . fleischer , whose firm also has served as an investment banker to enron , calls his holding "" a meaningful investment "" that is "" not small . "" but he disputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised . mr . fleischer says his clients "" are happy to know "" he has a stake in enron , because it shows he puts his money where his mouth is . in his research note wednesday , mr . fleischer called for complete disclosures of enron ' s off - balance sheet partnerships . despite the resulting difficulty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company , he wrote that he and many other investors historically "" have given enron the benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings "" and position as an industry leader . "" there ' s not information to really model this and be able to predict accurately where revenues are going to come from and where they ' re going to make their money , but every quarter they do , "" he says . "" it ' s hard to get inside to know all the transactions , but they do deliver . "" csfb ' s mr . launer also has been a longtime defender of the company , occasionally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about enron in the financial press . on monday , he wrote that he expects questions about enron ' s partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue , but that he remains "" confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [ enron ] and an ultimate recovery in the share price . "" "" i know i ' m wrong on the stock , "" mr . launer says . but he says that at these prices , he isn ' t ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worst - case scenario - - under which he envisions enron having to issue as much as $ 2 billion worth of shares , diluting current holders - - the stock doesn ' t have much further to fall . clearly , messrs . launer and flesicher aren ' t alone . "" even in relative terms , analysts remain very bullish on this stock , "" says chuck hill , director of research at thomson financial / first call . the average rating for a stock on wall street is 2 . 2 , or slightly shy of a "" buy "" rating . enron scores a 1 . 6 . "" this may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out , "" mr . hill says . in downgrading the stock this week , prudential analyst carol coale bumped it to "" sell "" from "" buy , "" with a brief stop at "" hold . "" while she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock , she openly concedes her recent downgrades come "" too little , too late . "" ms . coale says enron has been difficult to cover for years . she says the company ' s disclosure practices fall far short of ideal , and senior executives are often evasive , even when presented with direct questions . for instance , she says three weeks ago she asked enron management if the company was under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . they said "" no , "" she says . in light of the company ' s acknowledgment this week of an sec "" inquiry , "" she asked enron about the previous denial .

"" in july , fastow exited a limited partnership , from which he had reportedly reaped large profits , after shareholders and analysts objected to his involvement . concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowledged fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confidence . but that won ' t be an easy task , given the resentment about enron ' s disinclination to explain its problems . one analyst called fastow ' s departure "" unsettling , "" noting that management had given the cfo its endorsement only the day before . sounding a note of exasperation , analysts at j . p . morgan chase , banc of america securities and prudential all downgraded the stock . and there could be more trouble to come : the securities and exchange commission has issued enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions . 4 . gold diggers it ' s understandable that investors felt panicky in september . unfortunately , some reacted by shoving their hard - earned money into gold funds . according to financial research corp . , which tracks fund flows , the specialty precious - metals category was the best - selling equity category during september , with net inflows of $ 101 million . granted , that ' s not a huge sum in the mutual fund world . by comparison , during the same month , large growth funds saw net redemptions of $ 7 . 4 billion . but the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is noteworthy , given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long . sure , under the bizarre circumstances of late , they ' ve enjoyed somewhat of a pop . according to morningstar , the average precious - metals fund is up 10 . 08 % year to date . but over the past five years , the same category lost an embarrassing 14 . 68 % . by comparison , even large - cap growth funds - - everybody ' s favorite whipping boy - - managed to post a positive return . in the same period , they were up 7 . 13 % . moreover , circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades - - a combination of attacks on the u . s . government and war - - still don ' t seem to have boosted gold prices significantly . despite an initial surge in prices after the terrorist attacks , they ' re again approaching their pre - sept . 11 levels . it ' s too early to say , but it ' s likely the gold bugs will confront disappointment once again . 5 . amazon amazes once again amazon ( amzn : nasdaq - news - commentary ) still maintains it will become profitable by the fourth quarter . well , at least it will post a pro forma operating profit . ok , so maybe that wouldn ' t include amazon ' s service on $ 2 . 17 billion in long - term debt or extraordinary charges . in fact , a pro forma operating profit is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy , meaningless aura of minor triumph . the company still hasn ' t said when it will turn an economic profit . for that matter , even the fourth - quarter prediction is iffy . after announcing the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit , cfo warren jenson added the humble qualifier , "" there are no guarantees .

( creole : collection of reusable objects for language engineering . currently creole supports only algortihmic objects , but will be extended to data objects . ) a common model of language data resources would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs . at the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources ( e . g . lexicons are about words ) ; at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources . programmatic access would be available at all levels , allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an exciting element of the work could be to provide algorithms to dynamically merge common resources what we ' re suggesting initially is not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to existing resources . this is not a new standards initiative , but a way to build on previous initiatives . of course , the production of a common model that fully expressed all the subtleties of all resources would be a large undertaking , but we believe that it can be done incrementally , with useful results at each stage . early versions will stop decomposing the object structure of resources at a fairly high level , leaving the developer to handle the data structures native to the resources at the leaves of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucures . program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilks hamish cunningham wim peters remi zajac roberta catizone paola velardi maria teresa pazienza roberto basili bran boguraev sergei nirenburg james pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum",Safe Email
"listing of possible recruits here is a revised summary of the 13 candidates i sent to tony vasut . i believe he has made initial contact with each of them . if you decide you would like to talk to them , please don ' t mention my name , as some of them are former clients of mine , used to work with me , or still work with my husband ( i think you get the picture - i ' ve been gone from pwc less than a month ) . however , i would be pleased to talk to you about any of the people mentioned below . i have categorized them into 5 categories - senior level , it / risk , mid level , junior level , and admin assistants . i have not spoken to the majority of these people about giving our recruiting department their name ( see note above ) , with the exception of mark smith , dave simpson , and connie shugart . all of these people have indicated great interest in coming to enron . again , please call me with any questions , or need of further info . my extension is 39123 . best regards shona senior level risk people andy dunn until 3 weeks ago he was a director in the pwc risk management practice . due to a falling out between andy and the partners ( not client related ) , he left the firm . he is extremely well respected by both the audit and the non - audit personnel , and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise . i have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend him to enron . the downside to andy is that he lives in denver , is used to travelling a lot , but , at the last time we spoke ( a few months ago ) , is not interested in leaving denver . his cell phone ( if still in use ) is 303 807 0040 . mark ( allan ) smith mark is in the pwc energy risk management practice in houston . we worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for coral energy and equiva trading . prior to working at pwc , mark was at bp for 15 years where he had many different roles ( he worked as a crude trader , products trader , he worked in the risk management department , in the refinery itself as an engineer ) . mark was excellent to work with . clients are extremely impressed with his knowledge and background . i would highly recommend him for a leadership role at enron . i spoke to him and he is interested in pursuing opportunities at enron . his direct number is 713 356 4233 . his cell phone number is 713 412 3890 . it / risk people shawn lafferty , alan beaton , & carolyn johnson these people are all senior managers in kpmg ' s information risk management department and are all looking for opportunities outside kpmg . they all have 8 + years work experience in the it field . kpmg ' s main number is 713 319 2000 . mid level risk people marilyn chee she currently works for equiva trading , manager in - charge of accounting for derivatives . her role has expanded to encompass fas 133 and all mtm accounting entries . she liases with all book heads ( crude and all products ) . in the past , she worked in the texaco internal audit department . she was my main contact at equiva when i was their auditor . she is extremely diligent and very professional . i enjoyed working with her greatly and have to say she was one of the best people i have worked with in the capacity of a client / professional relationship . marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at the alliance and is extremely well respected . she has had a difficult year as she is doing a job that should be done by 3 + people . she has mentioned to me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase , and has even mentioned finding another job . however , due to the fact that she is so well respected where she is , she may be difficult to recruit ( 713 277 6280 ) . if you contact her i would not want my name associated with it due to the pwc / alliance relationship . scott barnes scott is an audit manager at pwc . he has worked in energy for his career , which he spent in houston and moscow and new york . he has worked as an audit manager , a special projects manager for the managing partner of the houston office , a manager in the capital markets group ( the group responsible for helping non - us companies prepare to register and list with the sec ) , and the transaction support group ( the group that is resposnible for performing due diligence procedures for pwc clients ) . he is looking for opportunities outside pwc . the pwc general line is 713 356 4000 . keith considine he is currently a senior accountant at pwc . he is the best senior pwc houston has , as well as probably one of the best people i have ever worked with ( the top of his class ) . although he only has 4 years of work experience ( all at pwc ) , he performs in a manager capacity . he worked for me on the coral energy audit engagement and received an excellent evaluation from both myself and the partners ( we all agreed that he is one of the best people any of us have seen or worked with ) . he is currently working on a project at one of pwc ' s clients to standardize their mid office processes . he definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of pwc , but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to manager . i actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at july 1 this year , but due to capacity issues , i don ' t expect that the promotion will be approved . his number is 713 356 5617 . junior level risk people robin manspeaker currently works as a scheduler at equiva trading . she has been there about a year and a half . before that , she worked at novarco in white plains ( a subsidiary of marc rich ) . she was there about 3 years . i do not know where she was before that . i have worked with her during my audits of marc rich . she seemed very well versed in her knowledge of her job and processes surrounding it . i do not have her number , but you can call shell information at 713 241 6161 and they will transfer you . dave simpson analyst at koch energy in houston , has a degree in accounting and has work experience of about 2 years . he is very interested in leaving koch . i know him on a person basis , but have not worked with him . he is a good guy and very likeable . his phone number is 713 544 7649 robert hernandez is someone who may be able to fill an open position at enron south america . last year , robert worked for me at ( pwc ) on the external audit of coral energy . he was a great worker and very good at his job . he speaks fluent spanish as well as fluent english . before working at pwc , robert worked in the gas trading industry in the mid / back office . i ' m not sure of all of his responsibilities , but i do know he was involved in gas actualizations . in total , i think he has about 4 years of work experience . he left pwc in march to take a position with heins in their internal audit department . i have not spoken to him since he left , but do know he paid a recruiter to find him this position . i do not know if he is happy at his current company or not . i do not know his number , but he can surely be found by using the general line . i looked it up for you and came up with two - 713 785 1494 , 713 225 0565 . admin assistants connie shugart she is currently working at pwc as an administrative assistant . she is also involved in recruiting experienced personnel for pwc ' s audit and internal audit service lines . she is very interested in enron and has asked me a few times to get her a contact here . i have not worked directly with her but due to her close proximity to my office i talked to her a number of times and was very impressed . ( 713 356 4000 - general pwc number ) . i have spoken to her about giving her name to tony and she is very excited about coming over and interviewing . she really wants to work for enron ! ellen robertson she is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave pwc . i have never worked with her , but she did come to ask me my opinion on how she should go about finding other work .

"re : regrouping of enw budget discussions wes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in each . the outline that i sent you with the changes for the remainder of this week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around people availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set . the schedule that we have been working with that wes provided did not allocate two hours for the friday meeting . if you had set aside two hours , that had not been communicated to us . there were only two one - hour meeting slots on that schedule . one for enw from 1 - 2 and one for research from 3 - 4 . i have a major conflict on friday - i committed months ago to attend a meeting that ken lay asked to be involved in that is in the woodlands that runs through the evening hours . . only because beth perlman is out on thursday for a religious holiday , i decided to "" skip out "" from this meeting to be here on friday afternoon to discuss the operations and it development budgets together . in order to minimize my time away from the woodlands meeting , i orchestrated the time swap with vince kaminiski so that we could have our enw meeting at 3 : 00 . i will talk with you later today and fill you in on the commitment for ken lay . maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution that works for both of us . i would appreciate your help on that , louise . scheduling issues aside , wes suggested that we also review with you the ees budget that enw has prepared . our approach so far has been to determine the appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all of the services that enw provides to support the ees business . we have done this without regard to who will cover which expenses - ees or ea . that is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provided and our best estimate at costs . we are prepared , however , with a suggested split on the costs for discussion purposes . i have assumed that the decision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of the chair for ees and enw . if you would like to cover all of enw ' s budgets together , both for ees and ea , then it would make more sense to set a longer block of time ( maybe 3 hours ? ) . i will bring my schedule to our meeting at 11 : 00 today to cover the canadian budget and we can work out a schedule that works for both of us . we will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction , but will hold that until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the components of costs and the detail of capital projects . our review of costs and projects in effect will serve as our "" scope of engagement "" discussion . a service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had been reached on the scope of the engagement . we will have a straw man for discussion on that . - - sally - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kitchen , louise sent : wednesday , september 26 , 2001 8 : 23 am to : beck , sally cc : piper , greg ; pickering , mark ; colwell , wes ; killen , faith ; roper , kerry ; schoppe , tammie ; valdez , christina subject : re : regrouping of enw budget discussions i am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in separation . i had allocated two hours on friday to do this from lpm until 3 pm . are you not intending an all in cost ( per transaction ) of it and operations ?

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+That's on a week like this that you realize that lots of porters are
European (and managed to free themselves for YAPC::Europe.) Or were they,
on the contrary, too busy in the big blue room ? On the other hand, the
number of bug reports stayed at its habitual average level.This story continues at:

[2]Perl Mongers web site, you'll see that it's just got a good deal
shorter. Over the last month or so, I've been making strenuous efforts to
contact all of the groups we had listed to see which ones were still
active. What you see is the result of this exercise. Almost half of the
groups have been removed because they haven't responded to my emails.If your local group still exists but is no longer listed, then that means
that I don't have an update to date contact for your group. Please [3]let
me know if that's the case.""Discuss this story at:

"re : 6 . 1049 , sum : e - mail citation on occasion i have heard or read papers , usually on discourse , that use as data excerpts from the conversation or interview books by studs terkel ( such as _ working _ or _ the good war _ ) . as a resident of chicago , i have the opportunity to hear studs terkel 's daily radio program broadcast on wfmt . once in a while , i have happened to read a passage in one of the books within a few days of hearing the same interview in a broadcast , and i have noticed that the published version does not correspond exactly to what is on the tape . that is , studs terkel edits the material for style before it goes into print . i had the opportunity to confirm this in a brief conversation with studs terkel on saturday afternoon , 29 july 1995 .

"Why am I so passionate about decentralization? Because I believe some of 
todayâ€™s most profound problems with networked applications are caused by 
centralization.Generically, a centralized political or economic system permits only one 
answer to a question, while decentralization permits many separate 
agents to hold different opinions of the same matter. In the specific 
context of software, centralized variables can only contain one valid 
value at a time. That limits us to only representing information A) 
according to the beliefs of a single agency, and B) that changes more 
slowly than it takes to propagate. Nevertheless, centralization is the 
basis for todayâ€™s most popular architectural style for developing 
network applications: client-server interaction using request-response 
communication protocols.I believe these are profound limitations, which we are already 
encountering in practice. Spam, for example, is in the eye of the 
beholder, yet our email protocols and tools do not acknowledge the 
separate interests of senders and receivers. Slamming, for another, 
unfairly advantages the bidder with the lowest-latency connection to a 
centralized auction server. Sharing ad-hoc wireless networks is yet a 
third example of decentralized resource allocation. Furthermore, as 
abstract as centralization-induced failures might seem today, these 
limits will _not_ improve as the cost of computing, storage, and 
communication bandwidth continue to plummet. Instead, the speed of light 
and human independence constitute _fundamental_ limits to centralized 
information representation, and hence centralized software architecture.

"small cap stox can sizzle the contact center industry few people today know exactly what a contact center does . its predecessor , the call center , brings to mind large telemarketing operations with people calling your house during dinner time . but the fact is that the contact center is much more than that . we see 800 numbers everywhere - the back of our credit cards , the fast food drive - thru window , i ' ll bet even your bottle of water has a phone number to call with questions . the fact is that wherever there is an 800 number , there is a person answering the call . not just a person , but millions of people in north america alone , across a staggering 76 , 000 + contact centers . it used to be the contact center only handled inbound customer service calls and outbound sales calls . that was before the proliferation of the internet - now these same customer service reps are waiting for our phone calls , our faxes , our emails and our web chats . we can call from our offices , home phones , cell phones - even from our computers - americans generate hundreds of millions of transactions each year for contact centers and the industry has grown by leaps and bounds . so aggressive is the growth that today , we are as likely to get someone in california to answer our call as we are to get someone in india . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * contact centers in north america handle millions of transactions each year . for each type of transaction there is a technology that supports it . automatic call distributors for inbound calls , interactive voice response systems ( the dreaded "" press 1 "" ) for self service , email and web servers . in the midst of all of this disparate technology , contact centers began to lose track of a very important piece of their puzzle : information . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the contact center industry is one of the most data intensive industries . think about it - even if you order a pair of shoes , the contact center has your name , phone number , mailing address , billing address , credit card information , etc . the contact center also has information on each and every one of their employees and all of their activity . every call they received , how long they talked , how long they placed people on hold , how many calls were transferred . until now , no single piece of technology can track information on all people regarding all activities , for one simple reason . the activities are all generated and tracked by different technologies . human science systems , inc . ( hmns ) company overview : human science systems , inc . ( pink sheets : hmns ) is a contact center software development firm . its flagship product , central authorityt serves one main purpose : to be a single point of contact for all data generated in the contact center . central authorityt can track and disseminate all data generated in the contact center , regardless of the technology where the data originated . central authorityt is a contact center resource management ( ccrmt ) product . ccrm is the act of managing data regarding all human , physical and technical resources within the contact center . contact center resources can all be categorized under four distinct umbrellas : employees , technology , capacity , and clients . it may be hard to believe , but the reality is that all functions within the contact center fall under one of those four categories , and our company has come up with a method and a technology that allows departments to easily exchange and leverage valuable data on a real - time basis . "" * why hmns should be on your radar : 1 . datamonitor states that the us contact center market reached a volume of 76 , 000 contact centers in 2001 and that by the end of 2006 that number will exceed 79 , 600 contact centers . 2 . contact center reporting and data tracking has always been burdensome , more so with the incorporation of the various technologies required to successfully compete in the industry . 3 . today ' s contact center requires a responsiveness that can only be achieved with timely and accurate insight into business conditions , but this is not easily accomplished in the absence of methods and technology to easily collect data from numerous disparate sources . 4 . contact centers are looking to replace manual or semi - automated methods of data collection and dissemination because they are not only burdensome , but highly inaccurate and complex . 5 . hmns principals have an established track record as industry experts going back over 15 years and have high level contacts in all of the top tier contact centers . top tier contact centers generate over $ 100 million per year within the north american market . 6 . hmns has patentable methods and technologies and recently retained a well known technology patent attorney to process its applications for the protection of its intellectual property . 7 . a recent report by empire research associates stated that the company could achieve rapid market share penetration in the contact center industry market segment and that a 5 % market share level in five years would be plausible . with a mere 5 % market share , a 40 % sales margin ( fully taxed ) would imply $ 10 million of net income in 2010 . in that event , the report noted that on the present 17 . 6 million shares , earnings would exceed $ 0 . 50 per share . the report concluded that "" the target market is large and enticing to hmns and we believe the company ' s product has a good chance of hitting it ! "" 8 . the company is negotiating distributorships through software distributors that currently generate billions of dollars in revenue from the center industry . 9 . hmns will generate revenue not only from software sales , but from application service provider ( asp ) services ( from customers that "" subscribe "" to the technology and access it by the internet ) , from installation ( billable at 12 % of the total software sale ) , and recurring maintenance ( recurring annual revenue billable at 18 % of the value of the software ) . 10 . datamonitor recently estimated the global market for call center component technologies at $ 4 . 1 billion , and predicts an increase to $ 5 . 5 billion by 2007 , growing at a 6 . 0 % compounded annual growth rate . 11 . gartner also reports positive and stable growth for software distributors , stating that end user spending was to exceed $ 76 . 1 billion by the end of 2005 . 12 . last year alone , u . s . banks were forecasted to spend $ 1 . 9 billion on contact center technology . * management and other comments : lou mandic , hmns ceo & president : "" this technology was born out of years worth of research . we are well engrained in this industry and are keenly aware of its needs . we are without a doubt delivering the most mission critical software in the industry today . we anticipate rapid growth , which is not uncommon in our industry . by its fourth year of operation , blue pumpkin - a company that provides only a portion of what central authority offers - had already captured a 7 % market share . a far lesser market share will have our company earning better than $ 10 million annually . "" company philosophy : "" if you can measure it you can manage it . "" * things to consider : according to empire research , the company has a competitively superior product , a large enough market to support sustained rapid growth , and a proprietary market position that can provide handsome profit returns . hmns is in the process of establishing distributorships with companies that annually sell billions of dollars worth of software to contact centers . hmns has buy - out appeal and has already been approached by far larger players that may later be interested in acquiring the company and / or its intellectual property . how the technology works central authorityt is a software product that fills the role of a central repository of data . through meta data tables , the software is able to "" read "" all other technologies , and act as a central point of contact for the enterprise . the software also collects data inherently ( this is data entered directly into central authorityt , not collected from other systems ) on employees , recruiting sources and performance , enabling the organization to better manage its human resource processes and reducing its turnover , which can be as high as 200 % in the contact center industry . * conclusion : the problem with inter - departmental communications is not exclusive to the contact center industry . it is a problem for corporate america as a whole . companies like human science systems are delivering the next mission critical piece of software - one that can normalize all data , across all technologies , and act as a single , central point of contact for the enterprise .",Phishing Email

Visa International, et al. in 1999, alleging it was harmed by Paul Guthrie, then a vice president with Visa. ZixIt alleged in its suit that Guthrie posted more than 400 anonymous messages, many of them negative, about ZixIt on the Yahoo Finance ZixIt Internet message board, causing ZixIt's stock price to drop.The suit also alleged that the postings destroyed the company's ability to market its ZixCharge Internet transaction authorization system, which allows consumers to make purchases without revealing their credit card numbers to merchants. Visa has a similar Internet payment system.ZixIt alleged that the postings caused its stock price to plummet. Had the product been successful, the company believed it would have been worth more than $1 billion, according to lawyers involved in the case.On July 31, a jury in Judge Merrill Hartman's 192nd District Court found that ZixIt's product was not harmed by the postings.Neal Manne and Kenneth McNeil, lawyers from Houston's Susman Godfrey who represented ZixIt at trial, did not return calls for comment by press time.""The company hasn't made any decision about an appeal,"" says Cindy Lawrence, a ZixIt spokeswoman. ""The outcome of the lawsuit doesn't have any effect on our future products and services in e-messaging.""GETTING GRADEDVisa's lawyers alleged that Guthrie acted on his own and had a right to free speech, and that Guthrie's Internet postings had no effect on ZixIt's stock. Guthrie has since left Visa, lawyers for the company say. Guthrie was not a defendant in the case. However, his interests in the case were represented by Todd Noonan, an attorney in Sacramento, Calif.'s Stevens & O'Connell. Noonan was recovering from surgery last week and was unavailable for comment.""I think people believe whether you succeed or fail [is] because of what you do and not what other people do to you. Internet companies didn't succeed for all sorts of reasons,"" says Jeff Tillotson, a partner in Dallas' Lynn, Tillotson & Pinker, who defended Visa at trial.ZixIt's case was a hard sell to the jury, especially with the reality of the economy, Tillotson says.""Everyone knows that the stock market has fallen and the trouble with Internet companies. I think the jury took that into account,"" Tillotson says.There were lessons to be learned from the Internet defamation trial, says Mike Lynn, who also represented Visa at trial. Even though message boards are considered a protected form of free speech, that freedom won't prevent a company from being dragged into court if its employee blasts another company on the Internet, Lynn says.""A company can be responsible for what an employee posts on a message board,"" Lynn says. ""The courts have said you're entitled to go to a jury to determine whether there are damages as a result of that. The law is very odd, not mature, [and] damage theories are not mature.""The nature of the case also added an interesting twist to the trial, Tillotson says. Many of those who posted messages on the board attended the trial and posted comments about the daily proceedings throughout the three-week trial, he says.""It was apparent to everyone that many of the people who posted on these message boards were watching the trial,"" Tillotson says. ""It really was wild. The lawyers felt like they were being graded.""-- --- end forwarded text -- ----------------- R. A.

ZDNet AnchorDesk NewsletterTUESDAY, JULY 16, 2002
Why we're changing our publishing schedule
Dear Reader,As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every FridayWhy are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.  Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works. I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.Sincerely,
David Coursey
Executive Editor

"re : 5 . 1462 comparative method a couple of remarks on recent exchange on comparative method : 1 ) as far as importance of morphology is concerned i believe that alexis is right ( sorry , karl ! ) . it is important , but i think that it would be impossible to insist that only morphological prallels like latin est , sunt and german ist , sind cited by karl teeter can prove relationship . old church slavic has the parallel forms iest # and so ~ t # , perfectly agreeing with karl teeter 's latin and german . however , in modern russian the present of copula dissapeared ( we can still recognize forms like iest ' and sut ' , but they sound bitterly archaic ) : on student ( he [ is ] student ) , oni studenty ( they [ are ] stu - dents ) . let us imagine the situation when the only surviving slavic language is russian and we just do not have old church slavonic materials . does the lack of the paradigm make russian less "" indoeuropean "" than latin or german , or does it make impossible the proof of its ie nature ? i think that the answer is in the negative . second , alexis is certainly right when he says that a refusal to admit lexical evidence will make impossible to prove that mandarin is related to cantonese or that vietnamese is related to khasi . even worse , we won't be able to state that beijing mandarin is related to xi ' an mandarin , or that hanoi vietnamese is related to saigon vietnamese , as nothing resembling est , sunt / ist , sind can be found in these closely related dialects . moreover , we would have to dismantle the families of north and north east asia as well , since their agglutinative morphology also does not exhibit anything of the kind ie does . therefore , continuing this claim logically to its end , we will have to state that there are around 50 unrelated languages in japan alone , because we have no possibility to prove the genetic relationship of various japanese dialects and subdialects , since they do not have a grammar like ie . there are cases when proof of genetic relationship is based mostly on grammar , but there are cases when it rests solely on lexical items , as well as there are lucky cases like ie when one can demonstrate the relatedness on the basis of both grammar and lexicon . absolutization of any of this cases may lead us to dismissal of pretty well established language families . the cases like "" proto _ english - french "" can actually be easily controlled by using basic voca - bulary in lexical comparisons : no matter how many romance words were borrowed b yenglish , its basic vocabulary is still germanic , which can be easily demon - strated , contrary to those who try to label the very idea of basic vocabulary as "" semantic primitive "" . 2 ) geoffrey pullum writes : ) i wonder if it would not be a good idea to hear something - - from the defenders of wide-ranging and large-time - depth comparison , prefererably - - concerning what would count as evidence against a genetic relationship ? the same things as in case of lower-level comparisons : either lack of regular phonetic correspondences , or lack of enough number of cognates , representing basic vocabulary items and / or basic morphological markers , established on the basis of these regular correspondences . this is why i , not being amerindianist myself , cannot believe in amerind : greenberg did not present any correspondences at all , and his whole method of "" mass comparisons "" is in direct violation of traditional and conservative comparative methodology . therefore , i would side with greenberg opponents on this matter . but i believe that it is absolutely unfair to put illich - svitych in one company with greenberg and ruhlen , as geoffrey pullum does in his posting . illich - svitych work starts with charts of phonetic correspondences , which do work regularly throughout his 3 - volume work , and is , therefore , in sharp contrast with greenberg 's "" mass comparisons "" . the whole work , at least in the areas i can judge of ( altaic and uralic ) is done with painstaiking care and accuracy , reflecting the state of the art , contemporary to the time when his work was done ( sixties ) . may be the opponents of long-range compa - rison should at last familiarize themselves with works of illich - svitych , dolgopol 's kii and others , which as i believe represent a successful long-range comparative work ( though it does not necessarily mean that i agree with all illich - svitych 's proposals : many things remain to be done ) , rather then to repeat the groundless allegations in illich - svitych address , and come forward with some concrete arguments against his work , rather than general statements that illich - svitych 's work is like greenberg 's or that there is a ceiling to the comparative method . sincerely , sasha vovin avvovin @ miamiu . acs . muohio . edu",Safe Email

Hi all,I have 3 or 4 email addresses (which get used for different
reasons), and I'd prefer not to mix them up. So I was wondering
if anyone knows of a way that I can have mail (apart from list
mail, which I have already sorted) which arrives to a certain
e-mail address have the From: header in the reply automatically
set to the address it came to.For example, say I have a company, and sales@company.com,
info@company.com and tech@company.com arrive in the same mailbox.
I don't want to reply to sales@company.com mails with the From:
set to dave@company.com, I would like the mail to come from
sales@company.com.Is there any way to do this? Bearing in mind that mail can arrive
with my email in the To or Cc fields (and Bcc?), and it might be
buried in a couple of dozen other recipients...Cheers,
Dave.--

						--Robert VamosiSenior Associate EditorCNET Software and Internet Services
Â Dear Readers,
So far, 2002 has been a year marked with variations on earlier
worms. If you update your antivirus software on a regular basis,
these new versions of Frethem and Yaha shouldn't be a nuisance.
But if you haven't updated in a while, these variants--plus the
continuing threat of Klez.h--should motivate you. In security
news, a flaw in certain versions of PGP encryption could affect
Outlook users. Read on to learn whether you're vulnerable.
 
						Â 
Frethem.k worm wants to give you a password
 An e-mail message that promises to reveal secret information with
a password is yet another variant from the pesky Frethem worm
family. Frethem.k, technically known as w32.frethem.k@mm, also
called Frethem.l by some vendors, uses its own SMTP engine to

much less elsewhere.  Population estimates vary wildly and about all
your average skeptic can do is take geometric means to get ballpark
figures.  While Central America may have had 20 or 30 million, vast
areas of South America were uninhabited and other places very
sparsely e.g., the plains Indians in what is now the U.S. may have
been 2 million or so.There are those who claim that the Mexican population declined from
20 something million to circa 8 or 10 million in the 16th century,
certainly, in part due to infectious diseases new and old, and other
factors, and was probably in decline before contact.  Others claim it
declined from 80-ish million to 3 or 4 million and somehow deduce 95%
mortality from imported diseases, and have a pretty clear agenda which
makes me (for one) take their claims with a large grain of salt.About all that is certain is that anyone alive in 1500 was dead in 1600,

"" enron has consistently said that it believes its dealings with the fastow - related partnerships were proper and properly disclosed . the company has said it put billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnership - related transactions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions . the sec inquiry came from the agency ' s fort worth , texas , regional office . according to a person familiar with the matter , this would indicate that the inquiry comes from the sec ' s enforcement arm , as opposed to its corporate - finance section . the participation of the enforcement branch would indicate that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of securities law . however , enforcement - branch inquiries often don ' t produce any allegations of wrongdoing . it also appears that the sec hasn ' t yet taken the step of launching a formal investigation , which would be a sign that the agency believes securities laws might have been violated . the sec declined to comment . certainly , there have been questions and concerns about those partnership transactions , which contributed to a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last week as part of enron ' s efforts to unwind the deals . mr . fastow , who has declined repeated interview requests , resigned from the partnerships , known as ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , in late july in the face of rising conflict - of - interest concerns by wall street analysts and major company investors . since then , internal partnership documents have shown that mr . fastow and perhaps a handful of enron associates made millions of dollars last year in fees and capital increases as general partner of the ljm 2 , the larger of the two partnerships . mr . fastow ' s partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside enron , according to people familiar with the matter . for instance , these people say , sometime after the creation of the partnerships in 1999 , enron treasurer jeffrey mcmahon went to company president jeffrey skilling and complained about potential conflicts of interest posed by mr . fastow ' s activities . mr . skilling didn ' t share mr . mcmahon ' s concern , these people say , and mr . mcmahon requested and received reassignment to another post . mr . skilling resigned as enron president and chief executive in mid - august , citing personal reasons and the fall in enron ' s stock price , which peaked at about $ 90 a share last year . mr . mcmahon and mr . skilling haven ' t responded to repeated interview requests . investors are also concerned about potential problems arising in enron ' s dealings with other related entities . in some cases , enron could be required to issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if certain so - called double trigger provisions occur . for example , last july enron helped create the marlin water trust ii , which sold $ 915 million in notes that are due july 15 , 2003 . however , enron can be considered in default , in advance of that date , if its stock price falls below $ 34 . 13 for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to below investment grade by either moody ' s investors service or standard & poor ' s . currently , enron debt is still investment - grade at both ratings agencies and would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment grade category . last week , moody ' s put enron on review for a possible downgrade . however , observers believe that even if moody ' s lowers enron ' s rating , the company will still be investment - grade . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . october 23 , 2001 where did the value go at enron ? by floyd norris new york times what really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen ? wall street has been puzzling over that since enron ( news / quote senior columnist thestreet . com 10 / 22 / 2001 07 : 15 am edt url : enron is trying to improve disclosure to investors , but its decision to reduce equity by $ 1 . 2 billion in the third quarter has created dismay and confusion in the market . the action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner . more important , investors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect enron ' s balance sheet , profits and earnings guidance . enron didn ' t provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction . enron doesn ' t include a balance sheet in its earnings release , so the equity decrease couldn ' t be spotted in numbers supplied tuesday . and even though enron did break out $ 1 billion in earnings charges in its release , the company didn ' t feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in the text . instead , the public first heard about it on a tuesday conference call . ceo kenneth lay said enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a so - called "" structured finance arrangement . "" the wall street journal later reported that enron ' s counter - party in this transaction was an investment partnership called ljm 2 co - investment , which has set up and run by enron ' s finance chief , andrew fastow . this is what lay said on the tuesday call about the equity move : "" in connection with the early termination , shareholders ' equity will be reduced approximately $ 1 . 2 billion , with a corresponding significant reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding . "" according to the journal , lay then said wednesday on another call that enron had repurchased 55 million shares . enron ' s supporters count lay ' s mention of a reduction in the share count as bullish , because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future . but there are two possible problems with this theory . first , enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to make $ 2 . 15 per share in operating earnings next year . critically , the company did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the 55 million shares or not . if the forecast does assume the exclusion of the 55 million shares , the company should have upped its 2002 per - share earnings forecast by around 6 % , since that ' s the amount by which the share count will be reduced . enron needs to say what share count it ' s using in its guidance . second , it ' s almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever recorded , casting a certain amount of doubt on lay ' s assertion that the share count will come down . why question the ceo ? well , in its 2000 annual report , enron included some disclosure of the 55 million shares connected with ljm 2 . it reads : "" at december 31 , 2000 , enron had derivative instruments . . . on 54 . 8 million shares of enron common stock . "" the derivative instruments appear to be types of options , or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stock at agreed prices . but these derivatives - linked shares don ' t show up where they should in the annual report : in the table that breaks out the difference between the basic and diluted share counts . the line item in this table that shows options - related shares totals only 43 million shares , which is close to the amount of employee pay options that qualified for inclusion . therefore , that number almost certainly doesn ' t include the 55 million ljm 2 - related shares . the fact is , at least some of the 55 million derivatives - linked shares should be included if the derivatives were like normal options . that ' s because the ljm 2 derivatives appear to have been "" in the money "" , or profitable for the holders . typically , all in - the - money options - based stock has to be included in the diluted share count . and these ljm 2 derivatives did appear to have that status at the end of 2000 . back then , enron stock was trading around $ 80 , way above the average $ 68 level at which these derivatives made money for ljm 2 . maybe these weren ' t simple options and had other conditions attached that excluded them from the diluted share count . that ' s what disclosure elsewhere in the annual report appears to imply . alternatively , the options were embedded somewhere else in the share count table or equity disclosure , though it ' s hard think where . presumably , investors will get a full explanation in enron ' s quarterly financial results filing with the securities and exchange commission , due by the middle of november .",Safe Email

I _think_ you need to install postgreql-odbc and its' dependencies. Then
probably a bit of configuration to open a port to the network. But
Matthias is right, this is not the right place for this question.To bring things back on topic, I was practicing my ""rpmbuild'n skillz""
and made an rpm with some simple software tools to drive my DVD+RW
burner. No GUI frontend, but it works just fine from the command line. I
even used it to burn a bootable DVD version of Red Hat 7.3.ftp://people.redhat.com/ckloiber/dvd+rw-tools-0.1.src.rpm--

My body is very strong and doing really well. My blood pressure is great. Heart rate is great. Cholesterol needs work and I have to lose a bunch of weight, and of course I can't smoke. Now the bad news. I have to be a saint for the rest of my life. I knew this day was coming. As I start to feel better, I want to relax. That ain't going to happen. Oy. Here's my old theme song. ""Don't ask me to be Mister Clean, cause baby I don't know how."" I need a new song. Oh mama. Â 
Ed Cone's got the blogging bug: ""I filed my N&R column about the bad proposed corporate hacking bill. It will run on Sunday -- it's an early deadline no matter what, but after blogging for a few months it's almost painful to wait so long. I feel like just posting it now, or scooping myself with the best parts....but patience is a virtue."" Hehe.Â 
Historian Stephen Ambrose, who is interviewed on the PBS News Hour today: ""You can do whatever the hell you want. Who's going to criticize you? And if they do, what the hell do you care?"" Â

Reuters: ""Stocks briefly extended their losses in late morning trading on Tuesday, biting into Monday's monster rally.""Â 
Thanks to Glenn Reynolds for the link to metsonline.net. As a Mets fan since 1962, I think it's great that sites like this exist and are flourishing. Like Bryan Hoch, the webmaster, I also run websites as a labor of love, and know there isn't generally a whole lot of money left over after you pay for bandwidth. I totally believe Hoch, a college student, when he says he isn't making money. The site clearly disclaims that it is not representative of the Mets or Major League Baseball. If you go deeper you see that Hoch contributed his time for free to help the Mets improve their own site, before all sites were taken over by MLB in 2001 (what a bad idea, why can't teams differentiate themselves based on the quality of their community sites). Now of course there's another side to it, so let's keep an open mind. But to the owners of the Mets, please remember, it's the fans that make it work, and it's pretty clear that this website is from the fans, for the fans and the team, and that's a good thing.Â 
Postscript: I've been emailing with Bryan, and asked if the local NY press has taken up his cause. He says: ""Not yet. You can help by calling any one of the major metro papers (Post, Daily News, Times, Newsday)."" More.. Ernie the Attorney is looking into this. ""LSU Law School is suing one of its students for trademark infringement over a website that he maintains. The site is called lsulaw.com, and it includes a school calendar, law-related links and comments by Douglas Dorhauer, some of them critical of the law school.""Â 
Bret Fausett, yesterday: ""It's hard to imagine a more complete win than what ICANN Director Karl Auerbach received today from Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs.""Â 
James Jarrett wonders where is his blog flow?Â 
Mark Crane writes: ""Woke up early the other morning, and started listening to a BBC special on the Silicon Valley. Suddenly I heard the voice of Dave Winer, and he sounded like this mellow California hippy-geek. You should do a DaveNet that is just a stream of you reading the essay.  Hearing the Dave voice totally changed my perceptions of the Dave Winer experience."" It's true, I have a pretty soft voice. I laugh a lot too. Many people are surprised. Â 
OSCON, last week, has done its job and stirred the embers of the Great Open Source Debate of the 1990s. I found myself writing in an email yesterday: ""Very little really usable software has come from people who are willing to work for $0. (I chose my words carefully, infrastructure is another matter entirely.)  Further, it's weird to say, as Richard Stallman does, that by coercing programmers to work for $0 that that's freedom. To me it seems obvious that that's slavery."" Â 
Washington Post: ""Operated for years by Internet addressing giant VeriSign Inc., dot-org is slated to get a new landlord in October when VeriSign relinquishes its hold on the domain.""Â 
Two years ago on this day: ""The best standard is the one with the most users.""Â

                               life-long pursuits         On July 17th, 2001, DMITRY SKLYAROV, coder for the Russian
         software house ELCOMSOFT, was arrested while visiting the
         US. His crime: writing code that exposed flaws in Adobe's
         e-book security, in contravention of the USA's exciting new
         DMCA. In the next year, thanks to widespread protests, Adobe
         withdrew their call to prosecute the Russian hacker and
         Dmitry was freed. Elcomsoft is still in the dock for
         breaching Adobe's copy restriction routines. If the aim of
         the prosecution was to cow them into keeping quiet about
         security problems, it doesn't appear to have worked. On July
         12th, 2002, ELCOMSOFT posted to Bugtraq a flaw in Adobe's
         e-book security. Namely, that in Adobe's ""lending library""
         web app for the Adobe Content Server, you can borrow a book
         for over twenty years (instead of three days) just by
         changing a hidden Web form value. The library site is just a
         demonstration app, so it's not a serious problem, but it
         does give Elcomsoft room for a catty little addendum. ""Some
         time ago"", they write ""we have found much more serious
         problem with another Adobe software and reported it to the
         vendor; however, there was no response at all, and so we
         decided not to waste our time reporting this one (about the
         library) to Adobe"". How much reaction do they want?
         Salt sown in the soil of Moscow and the Volga canal aflame?

         Ageless Corporations Who Have Retained Counsel Living Where
         Their Glowing Eyesockets Used To Be. Just days before we
         read on Slashdot that zombie company FORGENT is demanding
         patent license fees for users of JPEG, we're contacted by
         someone who has received a similiarly threatening letter -
         this time, from the rather more established Lucent
         Technologies. The message reads: ""After some market research
         it has come to our attention that some of your company's
         products may employ the JBIG/JPEG Standard. Therefore,
         Lucent Technologies GRL LLC, Lucent's licensing agent, is
         contacting your company regarding your interest in obtaining
         a license for patents."" What follows is the usual demand for
         fees, dire threats if compliance is thwarted, requests that
         the guards seize the criminals and throw them in Patent
         Dungeon, etc. Now, Lucent's patents don't seem to be
         breached by a JPEG implementaton (although it's known that
         JBIG is patent-encumbered; hence JBIG-2). So why does Lucent
         bring up JPEG at all? A curious wording for sure, and we'd
         be interested to see if anyone else has been contacted in
         these terms. Mail us at tips@spesh.com if you have.

         the site explains, ""sharpness is, above all, an attitude"". Now
         the dictionary says it's also ""having a bitter taste"", and
         ""harshness of manner"", and given that Hank, the Angry
         Drunken Dwarf is both unlisted and dead, we think Brooker's

         Kickbacks from the democratically selected venues? Or valuable

         Micro Fauntleroys"" will be permitted, says last year's
         judge, Matt Westcott. More weakness is shown by permitting
         Atari 2600s, which have 2K cartridges, to enter (you must
         fill the last 1K with zeros), and also the TI99/4A which as
         everyone knows has sixteen bits. We do hope this doesn't end

GET WINDOWS XP TIPS: Months after the release of Windows XP Professional and Home editions, people are still learning the nuances of Microsoft's newest operating system. Whether you've been using it for a while or are planning to upgrade to the new OS soon, this ebook is right up your alley. 
GET YOUR COPY 
of Lockergnome's Top 50 Windows XP tips now!    This is of course belated, as I'm sending it on the 18th, but Happy Birthday to Lori!One thing about MacWorld should excite mp3 junkies -- the iPod just got 
even bigger, with a 20GB version and Apple officially endorses Windows 
compatibility. Actually, the good news is, the 5GB and 10GB versions 
came down in price. Hearing that the only ""officially"" functional 
Windows player is MusicMatch Jukebox Plus is a serious downer, in my 
opinion. Sure, MusicMatch is a decent player, but with plenty of great 
free players on the market, why do we want to purchase a software 
player in addition to the $299+ hardware unit?At first glance, it looks like Apple is only paying lipservice to true 
Windows compatibility. I've seen no mention of any additional 
functionality, besides song management via one media playing utility. Mediafour's 
XPlay remains a 
better option, in my opinion. In addition to allowing you to use an 
iPod with almost any media player made for Windows, it assists with 
contact management, via Outlook vCards, in addition to making the 
iPod an additional drive on your PC. At a mere $10 more than MusicMatch 
Jukebox Plus, XPlay blows the doors off Apple's officially endorsed player.Lori and I made the five and a half hour drive to St. Louis for this year's 
SIC without a hitch. I just missed a 
face-to-face introduction to John Lal, of 
winferno.com, although I'm sure 
we'll meet tomorrow. John's the guy behind the 
free copy of Research-Desk 
for all Gnomedex attendees. Shortly after arrival, I enjoyed dinner with 
the eSellerate gang, with a 
discussion about GnomeTomes and 
what the future holds.Every time I travel, I'm reminded just how slow dialup really is. Fortunately, my 
Crosspaths.net connection allows me 
to send mail via my Lockergnome account, unlike most of the national dialup 
services. Crosspaths is technically an Iowa ISP, although the have points of 
presence in almost every major city in the country. If you're a dialup user, 
you may want to take a look at their offerings, regardless of where you live. Lori 
has used their DSL service for two years now, and they've been nothing short of 
outstanding in dealing with customer service queries.

Unknown artists across a variety of genres offer free mp3 downloads of 
selected tracks, with an option to purchase songs on CD for the price 
of shipping and handling. All CDs are professionally mastered works, 
so you're getting label quality releases, without the jacked-up retail 
price tag. The mp3s let you decide if the album is worth you $4.95. 
The only thing I find odd about this site is their proclamation of 
paying artists 50% of distribution profits, which I have to assume is 
50% of zero, since the CDs are free. The artist selection contains 
some solid releases by talented artists, regardless.

Click for DetailsWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (NR) 1966
Adapted Play - 131min
Reviewer's Tilt (10)
 Before directing Catch-22 and The Graduate, Mike Nichols made his big screen debut directing this adroit adaptation of Edward Albee's play ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?""  Nominated for thirteen, and winner of five, Academy Awards, this dark tale centers on history professor George (Richard Burton), and his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), daughter of the college president.  At first George and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-adjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love.  George and Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty cocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs.  Just as quickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology professor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic exchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise.  Soon Nick and Honey find themselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange.  Throughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely choreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead, alternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step.  Thankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost unadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and impeccable timing.  At one point George proposes ""Now that we're through with Humiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how about a little round of Get the Guests?""  This provides some idea of the precarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to finish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is Taylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold.  Ok, I will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not have been much of a stretch.  Both actors, however, deliver their lines with the chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying slaying.  Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax or look away.   Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is not a ""feel good"" movie. ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is, however, a memorable film that will stick with you for years to come.

"language resources & evaluation workshop workshop announcement and call for papers linguistic coreference workshop 26 may 1998 , morning session held in conjunction with the first international conference on language resources and evaluation granada , spain ( 28-30 may 1998 ) workshop aims it is essential , for a natural language processing system , to instantiate each object , process , attribute , and property correctly , so that all references to the same item be recognized as such and an inventory of all distinct items be accurate at all times . this problem is far from being resolved . there are both linguistic and computational reasons for this deficiency . first , there is no satisfactory microtheory of linguistic coreference . secondly and consequently , there is no satisfactory application of such a microtheory to nlp . a microtheory of coreference in natural language includes in its scope all the phenomena that satisfy the following condition : an object / entity , an event , an attribute , a property or its value , an attitude , or any combination of the above is referred to more than once in a natural-language text , and the understanding of the text depends on the correct interpretation of the two or more referring expressions as designating the same object , event , etc . a linguistic microtheory of coreference for a language consists of the following elements : - a complete range of covered phenomena in the language ; - a taxonomy of the range ; - a typology of the range ; - a list of rules forming the various types of coreference ; - a list of rules interpreting the various types of coreference . there has been a considerable amount of work on a few selected types of coreference , focusing almost exclusively on object coreference . thus , significant work has been done in theoretical linguistics on anaphora and cataphora , subsuming , for the large part , earlier work on deixis . a small minority of authors have tried to extend their studies of anaphora beyond mere syntax . in the cognitive-linguistics and philosophy-of - language traditions , interesting work has been done relating anaphora and deixis to ambiguity resolution and discourse structure . at the same time , an effort in comparative-contrastive linguistics has led some writers to examining the data of more than one language at a time , still emphasizing entity or object reference . in computational linguistics , the problem of coreference took early on the form of pronoun antecedent resolution , and this particular task , somewhat broadened to include a few other types of anaphora , still remains in the center of the problem . the most sustained effort in the computational treatment of coreference has been mounted within the tipster / muc - 6 initiative . while it has been recognized since quite early in the game that coreference resolution is based in large part on world knowledge , most of the work done on the matter computationally and theoretically ignores and avoids world knowledge . the muc - 6 initiative makes such an orientation quite explicit : the work should be based on such simpler resources as part-of - speech tagging , simple noun phrase recognition , basic semantic category information like , gender , number , and [ to a limited extent ] full parse trees . such an approach - - trying to explore and maximize everything that can be done simply and cheaply towards the resolution of a complex program - - is perfectly legitimate as long as it is realized that a considerable part of the problem remains unsolved , and it is indeed realized fully well within the muc - 6 initiative . one persistent problem throughout the existing computational ventures into coreference has been the lack of a consistent theoretical approach to it . the result is that coreference phenomena are treated as self-obvious , and most of them are overlooked , especially if they are not explicit pronoun-antecedent or other equally evident anaphora cases . what is needed for a full , accurate , and reliable approach to coreference can be summarized , somewhat schematically , as involving the following steps : 1 . understanding fully the range of the phenomenon and of the rules that govern it ( theory ) ; 2 . determining the extent of machine-tractable information in the rules ; 3 . taking stock of all the rules that can be computed ; 4 . developing the appropriate heuristics for the computable rules ; 5 . computing the rules . workshop agenda the workshop will be held during the morning session of 26 may 1998 and will include a joint address by the organizing committee ( listed above ) , followed by 5 - 8 individual presentations in two 90-120 - minute blocks , with a break provided midway through . call for papers the workshop solicits papers addressing any one or more of the points addressed above as well as any other pertinent issues . papers based on a diversity of languages are encouraged , both one language at a time and , especially , comparative / contrastive studies . also strongly encouraged are papers which extend the study of coreference beyond entity / object reference , across document boundaries , and / or into non-text media . format for submission paper submissions should consist of an extended abstract of approximately 800 words , along with a brief description of the proposed presentation structure ( e . g . , paper , paper plus demo , etc . ) . each submission should include a separate title page , providing the following information : the title to be printed in the conference program ; names and affiliations of all authors ; the full address of the primary author ( or alternate contact person ) , including phone , fax , email ; and required audio-visual equipment . papers may be submitted by sending three hardcopies or one softcopy ( in tex , ascii , or post-script format ) to the appropriate address as listed below : dr . victor raskin chair , interdepartmental program in linguistics heavilon hall purdue university west lafayette , in 47907 usa vraskin @ purdue . edu submissions must be received no later than 1 march 1998 for a 15 march notification of paper acceptance .

"new books on pragmatics john benjamins publishing would like to call your attention to the following new title in the field of pragmatics : function and structure in honor of susumo kuno akio kamio & ken - ichi takami ( eds . ) this collection of papers on functional syntax shows the development of a specific stream of functional linguistics initiated by susumu kuno of harvard university . inspired by prague school linguists such as jan firbas and vilem mathesius , kuno developed a more comprehensive and theory-oriented approach and lined it with the american formalist approach of generative grammar . his approach is thus a unique combination of functionalism and formalism that constantly urges the promotions of interactions between these two major trends in linguistics . the papers in this collection coherently deal with functional aspects of linguistics from a wide variety of perspectives such as theoretical , applicational , experimental and diachronic aspects incorporating the functional concept advocated by kuno . < br > contributions by : noriko akatsuka ; jacqueline guillemin - flescher ; akio kamio and margaret thomas ; becky kennedy ; kiri lee ; use men et . al . ; ken - ichi takami ; etsuko tomoda ; aiko utsugi ; gregory ward ; john whitman . 1998 . ca 360 pp . pragmatics and beyond new series 59 . us / canada : hb : 1 55619 822 1 price : usd 89 . 00 rest of the world : hb : 90 272 5073 1 price : nlg 178 , bernadette martinez - keck publicity / marketing tel : ( 215 ) 836-1200 fax : ( 215 ) 836-1204 e-mail : bernie @ benjamins . com john benjamins north america po box 27519 philadelphia pa 19118-0519 check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com /",Safe Email

"charity sees the need not the cost . . . dear friend , as you read this , i don ' t want you to feel sorry for me , because , i believe everyone will die someday . my name is mr . reza abdulla , a merchant in safat , in ( kuwait ) i was married with two children . my wife and two children died in a car accident six years a go . i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer . it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and right now i have only about a few months to live , according to medical experts . i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but my business . though i am very rich , i was never generous , i was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing i cared for . but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world . i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life a different way from how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends . i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so , i have decided to give alms to charity organizations , as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e , algeria and malaysia . now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself anymore . i once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which i have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan , they refused and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seem not to be contended with what i have left for them . the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of ten million seven hundred thousand american dollars ( u . s . $ 10 . 700 , 000 ) that i have with a finance / security company abroad . i will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations . i have set aside only 20 % for you and for your time and also 5 % as miscellaneous expenses . reply me at your earliest convenience for more directives to my private email address : reza _ abdulla @ walla . com god be with you . regards , mr . reza abdulla",Phishing Email

"NEW PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENTFrom: OUTSOURCE ENG.& MFG. INC.
Sir/Madam;This note is to inform you of new watchdog board technology for maintaining
continuous unattended operation of PC/Servers etc. that we have released for
distribution.
  
We are proud to announce Watchdog Control Center featuring MAM (Multiple
Applications Monitor) capability.
The key feature of this application enables you to monitor as many
applications as you
have resident on any computer as well as the operating system for
continuous unattended operation.  The Watchdog Control Center featuring
MAM capability expands third party application ""control"" of a Watchdog as
access to the application's
source code is no longer needed.Here is how it all works:
Upon installation of the application and Watchdog, the user may select
many configuration options, based on their model of Watchdog, to fit their
operational needs.  If the MAM feature is enabled, the user may select any
executable program that they wish for monitoring.A lock up of the operating system or if any one of the selected
applications is not running, the MAM feature, in
conjunction with the Watchdog, will reset the system allowing for
continuous operation.It's that simple!Watchdog Control Center is supported on most Microsoft Windows platforms
(Win9x/WinNT/Win2k) and includes a Linux version for PCI Programmable
Watchdogs.Watchdog Control Center Features:
- Automated installation
- Controls all Outsource Engineering Watchdogs
- User selectable Watchdog timeout period
- User selectable Watchdog stroke interval
- Multiple Application MonitoringIncluded on the Installation CD:
- Watchdog Control Center
- Watchdog Drivers
- DocumentationFor more information, please visit out website at

"all, I posted the below question to this list so I thought I'd update you all. Thanks for your suggestions.Well, I'd decided to bite the bullet and spend big on a new case and CPU fan.I bought a lian-li aluminum case. It was expensive as cases go (stgÂ£133.86) but I decided, it's a good basis to build any future PC on. It has 4 x 51/4"" drive bays and 6 x 3Â½"" drive bays so I should be ok for future upgrades etc. I have to say it was worth it. Its a pleasure to work on. It has a slide out tray to mount the Mother Board on, both sides come off, the drive bays come out...all without using a screwdriver (thumb screws). Even the edges inside the case are smooth so no banging your hands off shape edges etc. There are 4 fans inside the case, which can be set to 3 different speeds. There are 4 usb ports on the front of the box too. The box is big and has loads of room inside. Oh... and it looks very cool :-)However there are 2 things to look out for. On the Maplins website it says* Up to three 80mm case fans can be fitted! * ATX Power supply sold separatelyIn fact the case came with 4 fans and a power supply, which is great but I ordered 2 fans and a power supply separately. Also the case was a slightly different model to one advertised, as I got the USB model. It does say (Product may vary in design and specification from that show) but I missed that :-)I also bought a Flower Cooler Kit which is completely silent. Very nice. (thanks Mike)So now I can code-in-peace...Justin > -----Original Message----- > From: ilug-admin@linux.ie [mailto:ilug-admin@linux.ie]On Behalf Of > Justin MacCarthy > Sent: Monday, August 12, 2002 12:56 PM > To: Ilug@Linux.Ie > Subject: [ILUG] PC Cases > > > Hi all, I have a Linux box at home that makes a god awful amount of noise. > Its a Athlon XP 1900+ with a CoolerMaster fan.

"think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with Bureaucracy. Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) Canada. It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own ""Permit Rajs"" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars. They finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?-Ian. On Tuesday, August 20, 2002, at 12:09 PM, John Hall wrote:The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else -- by Hernando De Soto Is something I'm reading now.My impression is that France is not anywhere near the ""Permit Raj"" nightmare that India is (and became). Nor has its market been closed like India's has.But De Soto's work is perhaps just as important or more so. He hasn't dealt specifically with India, but I recall examples from Peru, Philippines, and Egypt. In Lima, his team took over a year (I think it was 2) working 8 hr days to legally register a 1 person company. In the Philippines, getting legal title can take 20 years. In Egypt, about 80% of the population in Cairo lives in places where they are officially illegal.India hasn't been helped by its socialism. Socialism has certainly helped strangle the country in permits. But perhaps De Soto is right that the real crippling thing is keeping most of the people out of the legal, official property system.Putting most of the people in the property system was something the west only finished about 100 years ago, or Japan did 50 years ago. It wasn't easy, but we live in a society that doesn't even remember we did it. -----Original Message----- From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Robert Harley Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2002 11:24 AM To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org Subject: Re: The Curse of India's SocialismRAH quoted: Indians are not poor because there are too many of them; they are poor because there are too many regulations and too much government intervention -- even today, a decade after reforms were begun. India's greatest problems arise from a political culture guided by socialist instincts on the one hand and an imbedded legal obligation on the other hand.Nice theory and all, but s/India/France/g and the statements hold just as true, yet France is #12 in the UN's HDI ranking, not #124. Since all parties must stand for socialism, no party espouses classical liberalismI'm not convinced that that classical liberalism is a good solution for countries in real difficulty. See Joseph Stiglitz (Nobel for Economics) on the FMI's failed remedies. Of course googling on ""Stiglitz FMI"" only brings up links in Spanish and French.

to preview your travels, or figure out where you are,
would be very valuable.Online gaming continues to grow. Screw ""Britannia"", 
real-life Britain would be a fun world to wander/
conquer/explore virtually, in role-playing or real-
time-strategy games.And of course, as James Rogers points out, it's an
ideal display substrate for all sorts of other 
overlaid data. Maps are great, photrealistic 3-D
maps of everywhere which can have many other static 
and dynamic datasets overlaid are spectacular. (Combining those last two thoughts: consider the
static world map, in faded colors, with patches
here-and-there covered by live webcams, stitched
over the static info in bright colors... it'd be
like the ""fog of war"" view in games like Warcraft,
over the real world.)- Gordon

"Dear Sir,I am Stanley Woodwork, the secetary of Africa White farmers
co-operation (AWFC) OF Zimbabwe. After the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president Mr. Robert Mugabe won the presidential election, the
government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme. This programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white African farmers for redistribution to black africans. This programme has attracted worldwide
condemnation from world leaders including British prime minister,mr Tony Blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of
victimization and physical abuse.
   Two weeks ago, our headquartes in Harare was attacked and
looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building. Fortunately,they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which
belong to the co-operation. This cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government.
   Now I have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe. The cash in question is US$46Million dollars.
   Once I can get your commitment and sincerity of investing
this funds on our behalf then I would proceed to get the funds freighted to Europe, where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us.
   You do not have anything to worry about as I would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe, and the business proposal is 100% legal and risk free.
   You would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe.
Please get back to me if you can be of assistance and I would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government.
   I expect 100% confidentiality and your prompt response to
this mail so as to proceed.you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork@email.com
Kind regards,Stanley Woodwork.

' ' the unraveling of enron , which is saddled with $ 15 billion in publicly held debt , began in october . shareholders ' equity was reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of the way the company accounted for outside partnerships it created . the announcement prompted lawsuits and an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission . nymex tells members enron trades must be approved ( update 2 ) 2001 - 11 - 29 15 : 16 ( new york ) nymex tells members enron trades must be approved ( update 2 ) ( adds analyst quote in fourth paragraph , enron share price in sixth paragraph . ) new york , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - new york mercantile exchange president j . robert collins told brokers on the largest energy exchange ' s trading floor that they could not accept orders from enron corp . unless they receive written authorization from an exchange clearing member . the order is effective immediately and will ` ` remain in effect until further notice from the exchange , ' ' according to a fax collins sent today to member firms . a copy of the fax was obtained by bloomberg news . exchange officials did not immediately return phone calls . enron ' s worsening financial condition has made many clearing members , which back trades on the exchange for a fee , wary of taking on additional business from enron . the nymex order aims to alert independent floor brokers that clearing members who once freely accepted enron trades may no longer be so willing , analysts said . nymex is ` ` reminding everyone that it ' s not business as usual when it comes to enron , ' ' said tim evans , senior energy analyst at ifr pegasus in new york , a unit of thomson corp . ` ` for enron , it mean slower order execution - - as if they don ' t have enough handicaps already . ' ' enron may be forced to file for bankruptcy to liquidate assets to pay off some of its $ 15 billion in publicly held debt , analyst said . enron shares fell 24 cents to 37 cents in afternoon trading . that ' s down from about $ 80 at the beginning of this year . covering enron debts under exchange rules , clearing members would be forced to cover enron ' s obligations if the firm defaulted on its positions . many energy traders , including rivals mirant corp . and aquila inc . , already have reduced the number of trades they ' re doing with enron in the over - the - counter markets , which involve direct trades between companies that don ' t carry the financial guarantees of regulated commodity exchanges . the new york exchange yesterday said it will raise margins on its natural gas and crude oil futures contracts at the close of trading today . margins are deposits traders must make with the exchange when buying or selling futures contracts to ensure obligations will be met . while the exchange gave no reason for the increase , the decision followed a day of wide changes in natural gas prices . the swings began after dynegy inc . abandoned plans to purchase enron , once the biggest gas trader . dynegy ceo says he ' d rather have enron pipeline than $ 1 . 5 bln 2001 - 11 - 29 14 : 56 ( new york ) dynegy ceo says he ' d rather have enron pipeline than $ 1 . 5 bln houston , nov . 29 , ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . chairman chuck watson said he would rather take over an enron pipeline than get back the $ 1 . 5 billion investment that entitles dynegy to the line . watson said dynegy expects to take over operation of the 16 , 500 - mile northern natural pipeline system by dec . 19 . chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26 percent of dynegy , gave enron $ 1 . 5 billion to help the cash - strapped company stay in business . the investment , part of dynegy ' s plan to buy enron , was backed by the northern natural system . dynegy backed out of the merger yesterday , and said it would exercise its right to take over the line . watson said he hopes that northern natural employees will continue to operate the pipeline after dynegy takes ownership . italian banks fall on concern about enron exposure ( update 2 ) 2001 - 11 - 29 14 : 20 ( new york ) italian banks fall on concern about enron exposure ( update 2 ) ( closes shares in second paragraph ; adds analyst comment from eighth , estimates of exposure in 10 th . ) milan , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - intesabci spa and unicredito italiano spa shares fell on investors ' concern that italian banks may not recoup money lent to units of enron corp . if the largest u . s . energy trader goes bankrupt . intesabci , italy ' s biggest bank , fell 2 . 4 percent to 2 . 75 euros while unicredito , the no . 2 lender , lost 1 . 9 percent to 4 . 24 euros . banca nazionale del lavoro spa , the nation ' s sixth - largest bank , dropped 1 . 4 percent to 2 . 55 . ` ` the theme of the day is to sell banks because they are exposed to enron , ' ' said daniele savare , who helps manage 120 million euros ( $ 106 million ) at bipielle asset management . ` ` in some cases , the reaction may be a bit overdone . ' ' dynegy inc . yesterday abandoned its proposed merger with enron , leaving the houston - based company burdened with debt and the likelihood of insolvency . some analysts said bankruptcy is inevitable and may come as early as today . a bankruptcy filing by enron , which reported more than $ 61 billion in assets , would be the biggest chapter 11 reorganization in history . ` ` i ' ve heard intesa is the most exposed , to the tune of between 400 billion and 500 billion lire ( $ 183 million - $ 229 million ) , ' ' said gianluca ferrari , who helps manage 260 million euros in stocks at banca valsabbina in brescia . gabrio gelmi , an intesa spokesman , confirmed enron is a client of the bank , though he declined to comment on the size of its exposure . luigi ferrari , a spokesman at san paolo - imi spa , said the exposure of italy ' s no . 3 bank was ` ` limited and under control . ' ' he declined to give an amount . diversified officials at unicredito , banca nazionale del lavoro and banca di roma spa were not immediately available for comment . ` ` it doesn ' t make sense to attribute the declines today purely to the enron exposure , ' ' said luca comi , head of research at eptasim . ` ` if it ' s just one company that ' s in trouble , banks are sufficiently diversified that the impact is very limited . ' ' comi said san paolo had told him enron had borrowed 80 million euros as part of a 120 million - euro credit line . of the loan , 50 million euros is guaranteed by enron assets , the analyst said . san paolo shares fell 1 percent to 12 . 41 euros . other banks have higher exposure to enron , such as 168 million euros for intesa , banca nazionale del lavoro ' s 142 million euros and 122 million euros at unicredito , investors said , citing analysts ' reports . argentine analysts , perez companc comment on tgs after enron 2001 - 11 - 29 15 : 55 ( new york ) buenos aires , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - eugenia benitez , an energy analyst at allaria ledesma & cia , esteban marx , an analyst at banco comafi , gustavo neffa , an analyst at bbva banco frances sa and mario grandinetti , head of perez companc ' s institutional relations , comment on the future of gas distributor transportadora de gas del sur sa . enron corp . , which together with perez companc owns 70 percent of tgs , may file for bankruptcy protection in the biggest bankruptcy reorganization in history . the move may force the largest u . s . energy trader to liquidate assets to pay some of its $ 15 billion in publicly held debt . eugenia benitez : ` ` the natural buyer is perez companc . there ' s definitely the possibility of reaching a deal that would make perez the only controlling shareholder of tgs . ` ` we would need to see how much tgs debt perez has . its debt profile is relevant . ` ` the acquisition would be another step in perez ' strategy of integrating all its operations in one holding . ' ' esteban marx : ` ` perez is the natural candidate , but i ' m not sure now is the right time for perez to pour money into tgs , unless it can get it really cheap . ' ' gustavo neffa : ` ` the only company that could make the sort of investment to by the tgs stake is perez companc , but its a huge investment given that tgs ' assets are worth about $ 1 billion . ` ` but it would definitely be the likely buyer . ' ' grandinetti : ` ` we ' re not permitted to buy enron ' s stake in tgs because of rules that prevent us having a majority stake . ` ` if the law is modified , then yes we would consider it . but there are also economic issues to consider .

' ' enron is poised to file the largest bankruptcy reorganization in history . the company is saddled with more than $ 15 billion in debt and had less than $ 2 billion in cash as of last week . it must pay $ 690 million to lenders by mid - december and is responsible for another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt owed by affiliated partnerships . the company ' s credit - rating was downgraded to junk status yesterday . ` ` considering enron ' s size and clout , there are very few companies in the energy business or electric utility companies that have not done business with them , ' ' said jon cartwright , a fixed - income analyst at raymond & james associates . ` ` i don ' t believe that everyone could have gotten out of their exposure . ' ' limited payments enron said yesterday it will continue payments necessary to maintain its trading and other core energy businesses , while suspending all others . it also resumed limited trading on its enrononline internet market , after shutting down most of yesterday . the new york mercantile exchange , the largest energy market , tightened trading restrictions on enron in a move that members said was made to limit the risk from any new business with the company . shares of enron fell 25 cents to 36 cents , compared with $ 70 a year ago . if enron is unable to pay all it owes , duke and williams said they would lose no more than $ 100 million each . duke , the largest u . s . utility owner , didn ' t stop trading with enron until yesterday , and warned that its earnings may be affected . ` ` we are closely monitoring this unfortunate situation to determine if a provision against earnings is appropriate , ' ' richard j . osborne , duke ' s executive vice president and chief risk officer , said in a statement today ` reassure investors ' energy companies that did business with enron are trying ` ` to reassure investors that they ' re not going to go belly up as a result of enron ' s demise , ' ' said gordon howald , an analyst at credit lyonnais securities inc . ` ` investors still need to be cautious about this industry , because there are a lot of unanswered questions . ' ' reliant resources inc . said it faces $ 80 million in losses from transactions with enron involving electricity and natural gas sales . dynegy said it faces $ 75 million in losses , though it plans to exercise its option under the buyout agreement to take the northern natural gas system in exchange for a $ 1 . 5 billion investment in enron . mirant corp . , an atlanta - based energy trader , said it would lose no more than $ 60 million . aquila inc . , american electric power co . and el paso corp . said each estimated their exposure to enron at $ 50 million . more losses centrica , the dominant u . k . natural - gas supplier , may write off contracts worth $ 43 million if enron fails , the company said in a statement . exelon corp . , owner of utilities in chicago and philadelphia , said its exposure is less than $ 20 million . dominion resources inc . , a power and gas utility said its exposure for past sales is $ 11 million . rwe , europe ' s fourth - biggest utility owner , said its open trading positions with enron are ` ` much less ' ' than $ 8 . 9 million . st . mary land and exploration co . , a denver - based natural - gas producer , said it has hedged $ 4 . 17 million of production with enron through 2003 . western gas resources inc . said it faces $ 2 . 6 million in possible losses . nrg energy inc . announced a potential liability of $ 10 million through its energy trading with enron , and plains resources inc . said its exposure through to the end of next year was about $ 630 , 000 . companies that did business with enron ` ` relied for the most part on the rating agencies ' ' to determine if enron was financially sound , credit lyonnais ' howald said . enron ` ` was investment grade , and they were solidly investment grade for some time . i don ' t think you can fault these companies for doing business with a company that represented 20 percent ' ' of the market . some companies , such as calpine corp . , said they had no exposure to enron . j . p . morgan has a $ 400 million loan secured by enron ' s transwestern and northern natural gas pipelines , the bank said . enron ' s problems aren ' t industry problems , felsinger tells cnbc 2001 - 11 - 29 16 : 33 ( new york ) san diego , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s problems are particular to the company and should not reflect on the energy industry , sempra energy group president donald felsinger said in an interview with financial news network cnbc . ` ` i ' ve really been surprised and impressed in how well the energy industry has responded with enron ' s problems , ' ' he said . ` ` the past month the energy players have stepped up and taken over positions that enron had , and the energy market today is working very well . ' ' felsinger said $ 15 million in business with enron isn ' t ` ` material ' ' and will not affect sempra energy ' s earnings this year or next year . california ' s senator dunn comments on possible enron bankruptcy 2001 - 11 - 29 17 : 03 ( new york ) sacramento , california , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - california state senator joseph dunn , chairman of a committee investigating possible price manipulation in the state ' s wholesale power market , comments on how an enron corp . bankruptcy would affect the probe : ` ` if we assume enron files for bankruptcy , either through liquidation or reorganization , our ability to deal with the corporate entity to get documents and access to witnesses will be overseen by a bankruptcy court , which means we have to jump through additional hoops and ladders to get the information we may require . ` ` substantively , it doesn ' t affect our investigation at all because the senate ' s investigation is not out to get anybody . we are tying to get a very thorough understanding of why we got into the mess we are in and whether any concrete legislative fixes in the wholesale market need to be taken . ` ` enron was a critical player in setting up the market that ultimately gave rise to the market power , which in my view is the ultimate cause of the energy crisis . ` ` there are some pluses and there are some minuses if we assume that enron disappeared from the energy trading market . it would create a void that would have to be filled by other players in the wholesale market . ` ` if those other players that fill that void do not currently posses market power , that ' s a good thing because the diffusion of market share , most economists will tell you , is one of the best ways to eliminate already existing market power . ` ` if enron goes into reorganization bankruptcy rather than liquidation , and they are purchased by one of the big players that currently possesses market power , then we are only going to complicate the crisis that we currently find ourselves in .

' ' bernstein said individual investors ought to consider putting their retirement savings into a combination of low - cost mutual funds that track indexes for u . s . stocks and bonds and international stocks . ` ` the average person has as much business managing their own retirement as they do taking out their own appendix , ' ' said bernstein , a neurologist by profession . in addition , average 401 ( k ) plan expenses of 3 . 5 percent of assets exceed the projected annual returns of 3 percent from stocks in coming years after adjusting for inflation , meaning investors are facing zero long - term real gains , bernstein said . expenses are lower with traditional corporate pension plans , known as defined benefit plans because they guarantee a certain level of retirement benefits based on pay and years of service . ` ` the way defined contribution plans are currently set up there is not adequate controls on expenses . what you ' re really getting is an enormous transfer of wealth from plan participants to the financial services industry . this is an enormous social experiment that ' s been foisted upon us and it ' s going to be a failure , ' ' said bernstein . enron corp . has fourth - busiest day for a u . s . stock : table 2001 - 11 - 29 17 : 17 ( new york ) enron corp . has fourth - busiest day for a u . s . stock : table new york , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . had the fourth most - active day for a u . s . stock , with 264 . 9 million shares trading , according to preliminary figures from the new york stock exchange . enron fell 25 cents , or 41 percent , to 36 cents a share . yesterday , the stock set an all - time volume record after dynegy inc . abandoned a takeover bid , leaving the company that was once the largest energy trader without enough cash to pay its $ 15 billion in debt . the following is a list of stocks with the 10 highest one - day trading volumes in u . s . market history , according to data from the nyse and the nasdaq stock market . * t stock date volume ( in millions ) enron corp . nov . 28 , 2001 345 . 7 intel corp . sept . 22 , 2000 308 . 7 cisco systems inc . feb . 7 , 2001 281 . 6 enron nov . 29 , 2001 264 . 9 oracle corp . march 2 , 2001 224 . 0 cisco systems jan . 10 , 2001 213 . 0 jds uniphase corp . july 26 , 2000 200 . 4 cisco systems oct . 3 , 2001 196 . 5 worldcom inc . nov . 1 , 2000 195 . 5 exodus communications sept . 25 , 2001 193 . 1 * t enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy ( update 3 ) 2001 - 11 - 29 17 : 30 ( new york ) enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy ( update 3 ) ( adds investor comment in eighth paragraph . ) washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . is poised to file the largest bankruptcy reorganization in history after dynegy inc . scuttled plans to acquire the energy trader that is saddled with more than $ 15 billion in debt . enron , with less than $ 2 billion in cash as of last week , must pay $ 690 million to lenders by mid - december and is responsible for another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt owed by affiliated partnerships . the company ' s credit - rating was downgraded to junk status yesterday . houston - based enron ' s collapse was underscored by new restrictions on its operations . the new york mercantile exchange barred floor members from accepting orders from enron without special written authorization , and the company ' s internet trading was reduced from about 30 commodities to just natural gas , electricity and metals . a bankruptcy filing by enron , which investors said may come within a matter of days , would top texaco inc . ' s record $ 35 . 9 billion case in 1987 . creditors would be lining up to claim what ' s left of the company ' s more than $ 61 billion in assets . ` ` it ' s a black hole , ' ' said gary hindes , managing director of deltec asset management llc , which has no investment in enron . ` ` until the forensic accountants can get in there and sort things out , you just don ' t know what enron ' s worth . ' ' duke energy corp . , j . p . morgan chase & co . , williams cos . and a dozen other companies say they may lose more than $ 1 billion combined from enron ' s collapse . electricity and natural gas companies said enron owed them almost $ 600 million as of yesterday . european administrator in london , was appointed administrator of enron ' s european holding company and some of its operating companies , a step other companies have taken before filing chapter 11 papers in the u . s . ` ` if i were a betting man , enron going into chapter 11 in the next week is a bet i ' d make , ' ' said glen hilton , who helps manage $ 125 million , including dynegy shares , for montgomery asset management . enron shares have lost more than $ 26 billion in market value in the last seven weeks . they fell 25 cents , or 41 percent , to 36 cents . the shares traded at $ 54 . 54 on june 4 . enron bonds were bid at 23 cents on the dollar in late trading , little changed from yesterday , traders said . the debt had been near full value as recently as last month . quarterly dividend the company said this morning it was evaluating whether it will pay a scheduled 12 . 5 - cent quarterly dividend on dec . 20 . enron hired the law firm weil gotshal & manges llp , which has the nation ' s largest bankruptcy practice , and the blackstone group lp investment banking firm . arthur newman , head of restructuring at blackstone , said his firm was retained and declined to comment further . chapter 11 would let enron officials continue to control the company while negotiating a recovery plan with creditors . a provision of u . s . bankruptcy law automatically blocks debt - collection efforts , lawsuits and other actions against the company . ` ` a chapter 11 filing can be a great thing for a cash - starved company being attacked from all sides , ' ' said nancy rapoport , dean of the university of houston law center . thousands affected an enron bankruptcy would affect thousands of people , including the company ' s 21 , 000 employees , its customers , suppliers , investors and other creditors . the court - supervised recovery process would give enron a chance to change strategies and fix mistakes . it might take years to complete and may end in the company ' s liquidation . in addition to its energy trading operation , enron operates a nationwide gas pipeline system spanning 25 , 000 miles . it also owns portland general electric , which generates and distributes power to about 725 , 000 customers in the pacific northwest . the company ' s enron broadband services is building a global fiber - optic communications network . chapter 11 reorganization lets companies abandon onerous contracts and unprofitable leases . ` ` every bad business deal enron got into they ' ll walk away from , ' ' said peter chapman , a distressed - debt investor who also publishes newsletters on high - profile bankruptcy reorganizations . recovery the goal in chapter 11 is a recovery plan that allows a company to pay creditors and come out of bankruptcy . a plan typically must be approved by a majority of creditors representing two - thirds of a company ' s debts . then a company would ask a bankruptcy judge for final approval . the recovery plan divides a company ' s value among various classes of creditors . under a hierarchy set by the u . s . bankruptcy code , secured creditors - - those with collateral backing their claims - - are paid ahead of unsecured creditors , such as bondholders and suppliers . financial advisers to creditors and companies in large bankruptcies say a chapter 11 recovery plan for enron would be particularly difficult to produce . ` ` you have a host of intangible assets combined with a morass of contingent liabilities creating a potential witches ' brew of a bankruptcy , ' ' said jeff werbalowsky of houlihan lokey howard & zukin , an investment banking firm that has been contacted for advice by enron bondholders . shareholders enron ' s shareholders are likely to lose all of their investment in chapter 11 because they would be last in line to get paid . some recovery for enron creditors in a bankruptcy case may come from lawsuits , said russell a . belinsky , an investment banker with chanin capital partners , which also has been approached for advice by enron bondholders . ` ` there ' s a lot of juicy legal issues , ' ' said belinsky . potential targets include enron ' s accounting firm and its officers and directors . ` ` disentangling all the pieces in a reorganization is going to be a painstaking job . ' ' liability dynegy might face some liability for cancelling its purchase of enron . dynegy invoked terms of the buyout agreement that gave it the right to purchase an enron natural gas pipeline if the takeover fell apart . dynegy received the right to the pipeline in exchange for a $ 1 . 5 billion investment in enron by chevrontexaco corp . , which owns one - fourth of dynegy . enron might use bankruptcy to prevent dynegy from walking away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the pipeline . the dynegy acquisition , valued at $ 23 billion when it was proposed on nov . 9 , collapsed as bankers failed to raise the $ 1 . 5 billion enron needed to operate until the deal was completed . the lack of funds and a credit downgrade contributed to dynegy ' s decision . bankers led by j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james b . lee tried for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed . investors turned them down because of heightened concern enron wouldn ' t be able to pay its debts . unraveling enron ' s unraveling began in october after it said shareholders ' equity was reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of the way the company accounted for outside partnerships it created . the announcement prompted lawsuits and an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission , and enron ended up restating earnings for almost five years . as shares plunged , enron ' s trading partners lost confidence the company would have the cash to pay bills . trading partners such as mirant corp . either demanded more collateral to trade or restricted trading with the company . ` ` the situation is dire , ' ' said deltec ' s hindes . ` ` no one ' s going to trade with enron right now because you could wind up being an unsecured creditor tomorrow .

Union Bank of Nigeria,
 
Lagos-Nigeria.
 
 
 
ATTN: THE PRESIDENT/C.E.O
 
STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 
 
 
Dear Sir,
 
I am Mr. Kenneth Uba, the manager bills and exchange
at the Foreign Remittance Department of the Union Bank of Nigeria Plc. 
 
I am writing this letter to ask for your support and
cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. 
 
We discovered an abandoned sum of $31,000,000.00 (Thirty One million United States Dollars only) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family of a wife and two children in November 1997 in a Plane crash.
  
Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as
the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative has ever appeared to claim the said fund. 
 
Upon this discovery, I and other officials in my department have agreed to make business with you and release the total amount into your account as the heir of the fund since no one came for it or discovered he maintained account with our bank, otherwise the fund will be returned to the bank's treasury as unclaimed fund.
 
We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus; 
20 % for you as foreign partner, 75 % for us the officials in my department and 5 % for the settlement of all local and foreign expenses incurred by us and you during the course of this business.
 Upon the successful completion of this transfer, I and one of my colleagues will come to your country and mind our share. It is from our 75 % we intend to import Agricultural machineries into my country as a way of recycling the fund.  To commence this transaction, we require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return e-mail and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number full name and address and your designated
bank coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer can be made.Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because of its nature. 
 
I look forward to receiving your prompt response.
 
 
 
Mr. Kenneth Uba
 
Union Bank of Nigeria.

"sum : more discussion of human and non-human language content - length : 18462 there 's been a fair amount of discussion about language among non-humans , both publicly on linguist and privately with me , since my previous summa - ry in linguist 6-28 . i have already posted to linguist a bibliographical list , broadcast in linguist 6-195 ; here follows a summary of some of the main points that have come up in discussion . first of all , i 'd like to thank the following people who posted messages to me personally : dan alford , a . k . a . moonhawk ( dalford @ s1 . csuhayward . edu ) celso alvarez - caccamo ( lxalvarz @ udc . es ) rachel lagunoff ( ihw1009 @ mvs . oac . ucla . edu ) dorothy hinshaw patent ( doropatent @ aol . com ) john e . limber ( jel @ christa . unh . edu ) alex schwartz ( alex _ schwartz @ sagepub . com ) andrew spencer ( spena @ essex . ac . uk ) mike tomasello ( tomas @ fs1 . psy . emory . edu ) bill turkel ( bill @ hivnet . ubc . ca ) george williams ( gww @ navisoft . com ) in addition to these individuals , the following people have posted items on the subject of language among nonhumans to linguist since 6-28 . i ' m going to focus less on these in the following summary , on the assumption that most of you have already read what they had to say . lloyd anderson ( ecoling @ applelink . apple . com ) sherri l . condon ( slc6859 @ usl . edu ) jane a . edwards ( edwards @ cogsci . berkeley . edu ) larry gorbet ( lgorbet @ mail . unm . edu ) jacques guy ( j . guy @ trl . oz . au ) gilbert harman ( ghh @ princeton . edu ) marion kee ( marion . kee @ a . nl . cs . cmu . edu ) bob krovetz ( krovetz @ cs . umass . edu ) roger lass ( roger @ beattie . uct . ac . za ) david pesetsky ( pesetsk @ mit . edu ) benji wald ( ibeneawj @ mvs . oac . ucla . edu ) sherman wilcox ( wilcox @ alcor . unm . edu ) one major issue that came up in discussion was the methodological and ethical justification of evaluating the linguistic ability of non-humans by confronting them with the task of mastering a language belonging to homo sapiens , instead of by investigating the means by which they inter - act amongst themselves . in linguist , benji wald pointed out that chomsky himself , in a paper pub - lished in the sebeok / sebeok vol . mentioned in my bibliography in linguist 6-195 , carefully drew the distinction between ' human language ' , the cog - nitive system built into the * human * brain that enables us to master the various human languages that are the raw data of our studies , and ' lan - guage ' ( which i shall in this posting capitalize - - not to be confused with lsa 's journal ) , the set of all possible similar systems , in whatever species ( or machine ) they may manifest themselves . this phase of the dis - cussion began with the question of the relation between an ability to re - cognize one 's image in a mirror and an ability to handle pronouns of vari - ous sorts , including reflexives . ( briefly , dogs and cats are able to re - cognize their reflections as members of their own species but consistently treat them as ' others ' , behaving toward them as they would to strangers of their own species ; roger lass has suggested that the ability to re - cognize the reflection as 's elf ' may not be evolutionarily advantageous to such predatory animals . the anthropoid apes , however , manage after a few minutes to realize that the reflection is 's elf ' , at which point they switch from the 's ocial ' behaviours they would normally use to make the acquaintance of strangers of their own species to using the mirror as a tool for self-inspection . but there has been no evidence presented , to my knowledge or that of anyone else on the list , that chimps , gorillas , etc . have any ability to handle anaphoric reference the way human apes do . sherri condon referred us to the work of her colleague at the univer - sity of southwestern louisiana , daniel j . povinelli , on this subject . ) but ultimately this discussion came back to a fundamental issue raised in my previous summary : even were it possible , through ingenious programme design and / or arduous effort , to teach a real human language to a chimp or a gorilla , the mere fact that the system in question would have to be ' force-fed ' , as it were , is evidence in itself that there is a serious difference between the cognitive systems of the two species ( human and non-human ) in question , since humans pick the stuff up with almost no training whatsoever . since much of our research programme is dedicated , more or less directly , to investigating the ability of humans to learn individual human languages ' naturally ' ( i . e . , with a minimum of effort ) - - at least in childhood - - this unredoubted fact places the linguistic abilities of non-humans at a significant distance from our discipline 's focus area . whether the field of linguistics ought to broaden its focus area to include non-human quasi-linguistic semiotic / communicative systems is another question , of course , that was raised in private discussion with me . speaking for myself , i am very sympathetic to the notion of embedding ( to use a very professional word ) linguistics as we now under - stand it within a broader programme of research into language , including the semiotic / communicative systems of non-human animals . supposing that such animals could accomplish the task of mastering a hu - man language ( which has so far not happened ) , this would certainly prove that the difference in species is not relevant to the nature of the lan - guage in question , much less language in general . but failure to accom - plish the task is not as probative , since it can be interpreted in either of at least two ways : ( 1 ) the animals in question are no more than ' protolinguistic ' ( to use bickerton 's term ) , unable to master a system of the complexity of human language - - a quantitative evaluation . ( 2 ) the animals in question are already in possession of an equivalent system of comparable complexity but of incompatible organization ( which ipso facto interferes catastrophically with the proposed task ) - - a qua - litative evaluation . which of these alternatives is correct will require a completely diffe - rent set of experiments , carefully studying the communicative behaviours natural to these animals as we linguists study the communicative beha - viours natural to humans . one of my correspondents said , ' why is all this effort devoted towards teaching apes a modified version of english ? a complex and highly social species such as this has an extremely sophisticated natural communication system of its own , yet we know very little about this . . . surely , before embarking on experimental meddling of dubious methodological validity , it would be more prudent to construct a research program aimed at mapping out the cognitive abilities of the various species and more particularly , their home-grown communication systems . presumably , it 's only against the background of how apes communicate with each other in the wild that we will really be able to interpret the kinds of artificial experiments pio - neered by the gardners and others . . . when you provide the reference list it would be extremely interesting ( though a lot of hard work ) to compare the amount of research effort expended on teaching apes 2 - year old english , compared to the number of studies devoted to ethological study of ape communication . ' a further , related issue was the epistemological question of how to reco - gnize behaviour in another species that is equivalent to language in hu - mans . i remarked myself at one point , ' human language is not purely a communication system , and its structure is not based solely on its commu - nicative function . i use language for a variety of functions . . . it does not strike me as logically self-evident that all of these functions should be served by the same system . i can imagine a species that en - gaged in all of these behaviours but used a radically different system for each . would we be able to recognize all these different systems ? and would all of them properly fall into the field of inquiry we call ' lin - guistics ' ? larry gorbet , in his linguist posting , touched very well on a further as - pect of this problem , addressing in particular one of the criticisms that has been made of the results achieved by the gardners et al . ' any formal element whose meaning includes displacement ( or more generally , * any * fairly abstract meaning ) will be intrinsically difficult to recognize as such , simply because the "" search space "" ( for the observable behavior that points to meaning ) is so large . the result is an * intrinsic * sample bias in semantic analysis : concrete meanings are more likely to be * disco - vered * than are more abstract ones , relative to their actual frequency of occurrence . in addition to abstract meanings in the more obvious sense , meanings which concern internal states ( e . g . "" emotions "" ) can be difficult to discern if one does n't experience those states or similar ones . ' a couple of references to the science fiction literature are relevant here , science fiction being often very useful for such ' thought-experi - ments ' in the einsteinian sense . h . beam piper , who while definitely not pc was brilliant , wrote a story called ' naudsonce ' ( pp . 57-112 in the col - lection federation , published 1981 by ace . piper suicided in 1964 , and i have no idea whether ' naudsonce ' was published anywhere during his life - time ) , in which an exploration party from earth discovers an extrasolar planet inhabited by an obviously sapient species which the explorers la - bel ' svants ' . these people are living at roughly a neolithic cultural / technological level , and there 's no question that they communicate by means of deliberately modulated sound waves transmitted through the air , so the humans immediately jump to the conclusion that they have something akin to what we call ' language ' , and the professional linguist they ' ve brought along for just such eventualities gets to work trying to analyse the svants ' ' language ' and establish inter-species communication . no go . turns out that although both svants and humans communicate by means of deliberately modulated , etc . , the resemblance ends there . our auditory systems ( by which i mean both the auditory centers of our brains and the neurosensory systems in our ears that serve as their input ) are designed to convert auditory impulses into a distinct sensory experience that we call ' hearing ' . the svants ' neurosensory systems are designed to convert such impulses into something more closely approximating the sensory expe - rience that tells us about our internal states ( e . g . , feelings of hunger , thirst , satiation , heartburn , etc . ) . thus , when a human reports a feel - ing of pain or pleasure , another human apprehends the message intellectu - ally ; when a svant reports such a feeling , an equivalent feeling is di - rectly induced in the body of another svant . in order to have any hope of inter-species communication , the human explorers have to rely on two peculiar individuals : a young male svant who is as a result of a birth defect 'd eaf ' , but is otherwise quite intelligent and shows promise of being able to master an ideographic writing system , and his mother , who is ' normal ' but sticks with her son out of maternal affection , and can interpret for him to the rest of the svant community . my point in giving this rather lengthy summary is that recognition of the fundamental diffe - rence between the human and svant communicative systems constitutes a ma - jor , and very challenging , cognitive leap for the human explorers ; can we be confident that a similar cognitive leap would not be necessary for us in evaluating the cognitive behaviours of non-human apes , cetaceans , etc . ? ( piper , speaking through some of his characters , expresses scepticism that a species whose principal communication system so thoroughly bypas - ses the ' higher / rational ' cognitive centers can develop very far in the way of civilization . i personally do n't share his scepticism . several of us during discussion have considered that cetaceans use sound both as their principal means of exploring the world around them , via sonar , and apparently to communicate . this suggests that a cetacean mode of commu - nication might involve ' projecting ' a sonar ' image ' of what one is talk - ing about into the listener 's brain . such projection may involve vocali - zation skill levels outside the abilities of cetaceans ; but assuming they could do it , i do n't think such 'd irect ' communicative methods preclude a high level of civilization . i ' m not sure they ' re all that different from the ability of the chinese , or of fluent signers , to communicate highly abstract concepts by means of what is essentially visual imagery . ) those of you who have read suzette hayden elgin 's intriguing though dif - fuse novel native tongue may remember that in that novel , humans , having over the course of several decades established contact with a variety of alien species and managed to negotiate profitable trade deals with seve - ral of them in spite of the obvious language barriers ( the only reason the generally despised profession of ' linguist ' is allowed to survive in this crypto-fascist state ) , encounters a species that is obviously sapi - ent and obviously endowed with something in the way of a language ( if i remember correctly , it 's not made clear exactly how this is recognized ) , but that ' language ' is so radically different from human language in its structural organization that no human seems to be able to get the hang of it ( several people die trying ) . in both cases , we are left with the big question : what , exactly , consti - tutes language , or a ' language ' ? and how do we recognize one if it exists ? on the subject of the cognitive organization of the brains of non-human primates , steven pinker , on p . 350 of his recent book the language ins - tinct : how the mind creates language , discusses their equivalents of broca 's and wernicke 's areas : ' the neuroanatomists al galaburda and terrence deacon have discovered areas in monkey brains that correspond in location , input-output cabling , and cellular composition to the human language areas . for example , there are homologues to wernicke 's and broca 's areas and a band of fibers connecting the two , just as in humans . the regions are not involved in producing the monkeys ' calls , nor are they involved in producing their gestures . the monkey seems to use the regions corresponding to wernicke 's area and its neighbors to recognize sound sequences and to discriminate the calls of other monkeys from its own calls . the broca 's homologues are involved in control over the mus - cles of the face , mouth , tongue , and larynx , and various subregions of these homologues receive inputs from the parts of the brain dedicated to hearing , the sense of touch in the mouth , tongue , and larynx , and areas in which streams of information from all the senses converge . ' for those of you who are interested , the relevant references are : deacon , t . w . 1988 . ' evolution of human language circuits ' in h . jerison & i . jerison , eds . , intelligence and evolutionary biology . new york : springer . - - - - . 1989 . ' the neural circuitry underlying primate calls and human language ' human evolution 4 : 367-401 . galaburda , a . m . & d . n . pandya . 1982 . ' role of architectonics and con - nections in the study of primate brain evolution ' in e . armstrong & d . falk , eds . , primate brain evolution . new york : plenum . beyond this , there is the fact that the integration of even complex so - cial systems is not enough to account for the complexity of human lan - guage . a large number of human social situations seem to be manageable by just a few dozen different utterances ; yet we have a natural linguis - tic ability vastly in excess of that . i suspect that our ancestors may have developed that ability through some nonce mutation , and then over the subsequent millenia have gradually developed uses for it .

identical copy of the same CD with propably millions of working keys.  Each 
download can be unique with a small preparation delay.  The key generator is 
a problem only if multiple keys are usable.  If the end users are teenagers, 
you'll face a huge wall when asking to be 100% of the time online but if we 
think of something like a health care system that keep track of patients 
personnal information, the end user will be willing to take every possible 
steps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly.I agree with all of you that mass production CDs will not be safe from piracy 
in a near futur.  That can be seen as a collateral of mass market 
penetration.BTW thanks for all of you who provided interestiong insight.  I'm playing with

"More than a dozen jokes - thanks guys and girls!
(plus some anti-French abuse from the usual suspect).Well my brain doesn't hurt so much any more, and it was well worth it.
I've now got an even faster method for elliptic-curve point counting,
both pratically and asymptotically.It lifts a curve over a field of degree n in time O(n^(2+1/2+eps)),
or O(n^(2+eps)) with precomputation.  Before the best methods took
O(n^(3+eps)) without precomputation, or O(n^(2+1/2+eps)) with it.
The precomputation is done once per field, not per curve, and takes
time O(n^(3+eps)).  Here eps is an arbitrarily small number, hiding
some logarithmic factors.After lifting, you compute a norm in time O(n^(2+1/3+eps)) to get the
number of points on the curve.Here's an example over a 1009-bit field, without precomputation, using
a 1 GHz Pentium III:------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Robert Harley:
>It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly, 
>precisely identical between males and females.Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations.
But that obscures the different modes of
promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for
money or power or companionship and the person
who uses money and power and companionship to
get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense
of the word. But their motives and behavior are
quite different.Langur monkeys were the example in the cited
article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that
are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey
.. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But
cozying up to the current dominant male isn't
the best strategy for female langurs, because
""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every
27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many
extra-group males as possible, female langurs
ensure their offspring against infanticide,""
by the male who is likely next to rule the
roost.Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a
picture of carefree females engaged in joyously
promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who
is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a
better picture of that. ;-)_________________________________________________________________

there's not much need to be wireless based on up-to-the-minute data.
I expect most geologists travel with a laptop perfectly capable of DVD
playback, and I also expect the most interesting geology is in regions
where the wireless ain't going to go ;)I don't mean to nit-pick, it's just that I'm curious as to (a) the
need for this product that justifies the extreme cost and (b) how we'd
justify the ubiquitous next-generation wireless network that this

"california 6 / 13 executive summary - cpuc rules that socal must pay 15 % of debt to qfs ( approximately $ 50 million ) - ruling heightens likelihood of voluntary bankruptcy filing by socal - voluntary filing further heightened by successful ring - fencing by eix parent - bankruptcy judge firm in support for qfs report 1 . socal loses cpuc ruling , but retains appeal option as you may have seen , bloomberg reported that the cpuc voted 5 - 0 to force socal to make 15 % of its payments owed to alternative energy producers in california . cpuc rules allow 30 days to appeal its rulings , leaving a window open for socal to buy more time . 2 . voluntary filing in ? with regard to a socal bankruptcy filing , the key now is how socal ' s board feels about progress rather than deadlines with creditors . in other words , sources believe that a voluntary filing is more likely than an involuntary filing . a continuing lack of progress on a bailout and an increase in the number of liens filed against socal is more likely to make the socal board want to file for bankrutpcy voluntarily . the recent ring - fencing by edison international reflects their need to pay off cross - default risk and to cut ties in their bank facility between the parent company and lines of credit helds by socal . in and of outself , it does not necessarily signal an imminent filing . 3 . involuntary out ? sources indicate that the unsecured financial creditors are not considering a filing against socal . this is because the financial creditors believe that they would still be worse off in bankruptcy . sources report that in creditor discussions , there has not been talk of the debt holders not being paid . "" people have talked about screwing the generators and everyone else , but not the debt holders , "" a source commented . the qfs are unlikely to file against socal because they have fairly good contracts in place . also , they receive high capacity fees in the summer ( these fees vary seasonally and are distinct from generating fees ) . these capacity fees are calculated on a rolling , 4 - year basis and will be re - calculated next year . the qfs want this summer included in the recalculation , incentivizing them to keep their contracts in place . 4 . montali supporting qfs judge montali , by his recent rulings , is sending a signal that he is concerned for the qfs and is sensitive to their hardships . he is trying to help them through his rulings . for example , as long as qfs remain on line , those who petition can receive additional payments from pg & e . over a 4 - month period , these payments equal 20 % of the qfs ' pre - petition claims . this provides the qfs incentive to remain connected to pg & e . 5 . ge looking to restructure generating capacity financing general electric is reportedly "" deeply concerned "" about the stability of financing generating capacity in the us . ( ge has over 70 % of the gas turbine market . ) ge is reportedly trying to keep its margins down and is not raising its prices due to concerns about instability . sources believe that a very significant percentage of generating capacity financing will have to be restrucured in five years .",Safe Email

"URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/08.html#in_praise_of_evolvable_formats
Date: 2002-10-08T12:28:10-05:00_Clay Shirky_: In Praise of Evolvable Systems[1]. This entire article could be 
rewritten to explain RSS. In fact, let's do that. If it were April Fool's Day, the Net's only official holiday, and you wanted to 
design a â€œnovelty formatâ€ to slip by the W3C as a joke, it might 
look something like RSS 0.9x/2.0: - It would specify limits on data values, then remove them, then specify 
required elements, then make them optional, thus silently breaking an unknown 
number of parsers around the world. 
- It would encourage use of entity-encoded HTML in its most important element, 
thus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user. 
- It would ignore years of standards work in other fields, committing such 
egregious sins as defining a guid element that wasn't a GUID, and using an 
obsolete date format that couldn't easily be sorted by date. 
- Its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core 
namespace without telling anyone or documenting them, thus making it wholely 
resistant to DTD, schema, or validation of any kind. 
- After years of worldwide deployment, it would completely reverse its 
add-whatever-you-want extensibility rules in favor of namespaces, which the 
spec would neither define nor elaborate on. 
- After adopting namespaces, it would fail to deprecate any existing elements 
semantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use. It would also 
fail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the 
same thing in two different ways, thus ensuring mass confusion among producers 
and inconsistent behavior across consumers. RSS 0.9x and 2.0 are the Whoopee Cushion and Joy Buzzer of syndication formats. 
For anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata, it's 
pretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication 
format, we have the worst one possible. Except, of course, for all the others. The problem with that list of RSS deficiencies is that it is also a list of 
necessitiesâ€”RSS has flourished in a way that no other syndication format 
has, not despite many of these qualities but because of them. The very 
weaknesses that make RSS so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it 
possible in the first place. - Removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened 
up RSS to a whole new category of producer: the weblogger. 
- Allowing encoded HTML in description let publishers reuse both their existing 
content and the existing RSS infrastructure, without requiring them to produce 
valid XHTML (which could be embedded directly into an XML document). Social 
mores, rather than technical rules, prevent producers from intentionally 
introducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable 
display through unclosed HTML elements. 
- Few publishing tools can produce real conforming GUIDs, and it doesn't 
matter, because virtually all RSS parsers are written in high level languages 
where handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes 
and handling bytecodes. As for dates, by convention an RSS document is laid out 
in reverse chronological order, and no one seems to be clamoring for more 
flexibility. Furthermore, its almost babyish XML syntax, so far from any serious 
computational framework (Where are the namespaces? Where is the Document Type 
Description? Why is the aggregators' enforcement of conformity so lax?), made 
it possible for anyone wanting an RSS feed to write one. The effects of this 
ease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts 
over the years to â€œdo RSS rightâ€â€”most notably RSS 1.0 in the 
year 2000. RSS 1.0 had three main benefits: - Backward compatible with RSS 0.90, which was never widely deployed, and which 
fell into obscurity as soon as (the much simpler) RSS 0.91 was introduced. 
- Based on RDF (specifically a serialization called RDF/XML), a spec which, at 
the time and to this day, continues to change or threaten to change. Two years 
later, there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with 
parsers to consume RDF, although many (Perl, Python, .NET) have third-party RDF 
parsers in various states of development and conformance. (The release version 
is generally out of date; CVS access is recommended. You get the idea.) 
Meanwhile, RDF/XML production tools are so inconsistent that even RDF experts 
recommend not using RDF tools to produce an RSS 1.0 feed if you want it to 
actually be read by any major RSS aggregator. Despite the two-year-old promise 
of better tools[2], it is now the year 2002, and I built my RSS 1.0 
feedâ€”in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the 
worldâ€”by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets 
into a TEXTAREA of an HTML form. 
- Extensible through namespaces, which, as mentioned above, have been 
haphazardly and poorly incorporated into RSS 2.0, where they appear to be 
flourishing. Evolvable formatsâ€”those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a 
thousand small waysâ€”have three main characteristics that are germane to 
their eventual victories over strong, centrally designed formats. - Only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed. 
My RSS feed is an XML document produced by a template that I built in a 
TEXTAREA, and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know 
nothing of XML and hack apart my feed with regular expressions. The world is 
littered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools. 
If everyone in the world had a perfect RDF parser at their disposal, it would 
be trivial to produce and consume all the world's metadata in RDF. Without such 
perfect tools, both production and consumption instantly become nightmares. 
There is no middle ground. 
- What is, is wrong. Because evolvable formats have always been adapted to 
earlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions, 
they are always behind the times. RSS was being stretched with long 
descriptions, optional titles, and entity-encoded HTML even before such 
practices were codified in the spec, and long before all consumers could handle 
them. No evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it 
faces. 
- Finally, Orgel's Rule, named for the evolutionary biologist Leslie 
Orgelâ€”â€œEvolution is cleverer than you areâ€. As with the list 
of RSS's obvious deficiencies above, it is easy to point out what is wrong with 
any evolvable system at any point in its life. No one seeing RSS 1.0 and RSS 
0.91 side-by-side could doubt that RSS 1.0 had the superior technology, that it 
â€œdid things rightâ€. However, the ability to understand what is 
missing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central 
group can design a better system in the long haul. Designed formats start out strong and improve logarithmically. Evolvable 
formats start out weak and improve exponentially. RSS 2.0 is not the perfect 
syndication format, just the best one that's also currently practical. 
Infrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete, 
partially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition.[1] http://www.shirky.com/writings/evolve.html

If you're running spamc as some other user though (eg. root, mail, nobody, cyrus, etc.) then you can still use this flag. The solution is to set DROPPRIVS=yes in /etc/procmailrc, just before running spamc. From the procmailrc man page: DROPPRIVS If set to `yes' procmail will drop all privileges it might have had (suid or sgid). This is only useful if you want to guarantee that the bottom half of the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on behalf of the recipient. I hope that helps, and I also hope it's right!St- | -----Original Message----- | From: spamassassin-talk-admin@example.sourceforge.net | [mailto:spamassassin-talk-admin@lists.sourceforge.net]On Behalf Of | Cheryl L.

"query : writing and phonology are there many languages with contrastive vowel length which dont represent vowel length in the writing system ? this does happen when someone with a poor understanding of the language devises a writing system for it from outside , or when a vowel length language adopts a writing system from a non-vowel - length language , but i would be interested to hear of cases of indigenous writing systems that ignore such an important aspect of phonology . the reason for my interest is korean . it is often said to have contrastive vowel length , at least in certain word-pairs , and yet it does not show it in the script . the fact it doesnt - coupled with the fact that native speakers have difficulty picking which word has the long vowel - seems to me like an argument for treating the distinction as one of accent or stress rather than vowel length . but the argument depends on how common it is for writing systems to ignore vowel length . what do people think ? reply to me and i ' ll make a summary of responses if there are several . thanks helen _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ hfraser @ metz . une . edu . au ( 129 . 180 . 4 . 1 ) helen fraser ( dr ) dept of linguistics university of new england armidale nsw 2351 australia phone 067 73 2128 / 3189 fax 067 73 3735",Safe Email

  It's been about 20 years since a new Atari 400 or Commodore Vic
20 could be had for less than $200. Even then, those relics were
well on their way from bargain bins to the dust bin of PC history.
  Since then, few if any new computers have sold for less than
$200. Any that did were seriously outdated or inoperable.
  Now, in a challenge to established tech giants, several upstarts
have banded together to create a PC that retails for $199.86.
  It doesn't do Windows. In fact, it doesn't do a lot of things.
  The Microtel SYSMAR710, sold only at Wal-Mart's online store,
runs on a Linux operating system variant called Lindows, which has
been hyped as a new choice for consumers who want to break away
from the Microsoft monopoly....     - http://finance.lycos.com/home/news/story.asp?story=28928829

solicited commercial email?I know I've registered for many commercial lists that send material that
really reads like spam.  Moreover, spammers will be able to circumvent
SA if they make spam look like this SCE.  This kind of convergence of the
two.... well, it stinks.  We can kill SCE, or we can cripple
identification of UCE.Obviously an interim solution is to whitelist, but long term is probably
harder.  What kind of SCE, like MSDN newsletters, product updates, etc
is in the corpus for the GA?  Maybe seeding the corpus with a bigger set
of these type of mails will have some interesting/useful results.Ross Vandegrift

Shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship. If
shouting down public speakers is 'protected' it is only a matter of time
before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against
them -every single time they open their mouth-. The tactic is stupid and
non-productive and if generally used, will only result in chaos.  The tactic
is just stupid ego-bation at best, unless the goal is to generate chaos.
And humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society
should be locked up (provided you can accurately identify them, which is not
really possible anyway, but hey, this is my rant :-). IMHO.Bill

Rohit===========================================================DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
ByÂ Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PTDATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a 
family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The 
DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up 
to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company 
itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, 
while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes 
and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of 
XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application 
co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in 
May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.=========================================================================DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3â„¢), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.Today, XG3â„¢ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of 
products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, 
drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.=========================================================================DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in FundingVenrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer 
in XML-Aware Networking for Web ServicesCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed 
Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, 
and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPowerâ€™s Board of

at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPowerâ€™s solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3â„¢) technology.""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPowerâ€™s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML thatâ€™s critical to Web 
services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single 
DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
serversâ€”breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPowerâ€™s patent-pending technology addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPowerâ€™s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls.""""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly 
growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on 
their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3)Â technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPowerâ€™s 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely 
on XML for mission critical applications.""About Venrock Associates

"Welcome to 2002.  Companies that have taken on way too much debt can
screw their shareholders and even some of their debt-holders by
declaring bankruptcy, as Enron and Worldcom have done; meanwhile,
it becomes more difficult for individuals who have similarly taken on
too much debt, to dig their way out of their own holes...In my next life, I'm coming back as a corporation.  They get all the
perks. :)
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/27/business/27BANK.htmlA Sudden Rush to Declare Bankruptcy Is Expected
By PHILIP SHENONWASHINGTON, July 26 The compromise bill, which was approved on Thursday
by Congressional negotiators and is expected to be adopted in both the
House and Senate by the end of next week, will make it much harder for
Americans to wipe out their debts when they declare bankruptcy.After the agreement, lawyers around the country said that they had begun
to receive calls and visits from debtors worried that they needed to
file bankruptcy before the old rules lapse next year.""I've had plenty of calls this morning,"" said Gary F. Weltmann, a
consumer bankruptcy lawyer in Washington. ""And I'm telling people that
they need to take action now.""Marty K. Courson, a bankruptcy lawyer in San Francisco, said he was
""getting ready for the onslaught.""""I do think there will be a lot of people trying to use the old rules,""
he said.The White House announced today that President Bush would sign the bill,
which was scheduled for a final vote in the House late tonight and in
the Senate next week. ""The president looks forward to signing that,"" said Ari Fleischer, the
White House spokesman. ""That bill enjoys widespread bipartisan support
for good reasons."" The bill, which had been stalled until this week in a House-Senate
conference committee, passed both chambers by overwhelming margins more
than a year ago. The conference committee approved the bill Thursday
after agreeing on an abortion-rights provision that had been the final
obstacle to passage; the provision will bar anti-abortion protesters
from using the bankruptcy laws to avoid paying court judgments as a
result of clinic protests.The bill has long been the top legislative priority of the credit card
and banking industries, which say that many people now abuse the
bankruptcy system by writing off debts that they should be able to
pay. There were 1.45 million bankruptcy filings last year, a record, up
19 percent from 2000.""This legislation restores integrity and accountability to our
bankruptcy system by offering a fresh start to those who deserve one
while cracking down on those who don't,"" said Representative F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee.Critics, including top consumer-rights groups, described the bill as a
gift to lenders in exchange for a recent, drastic increase in campaign
contributions to members of Congress. They also said that it would do
harm to millions of Americans in financial distress as a result of lost
jobs, poor health or divorce.The bill's opponents have also questioned the timing of its passage,
which comes in the midst of a Congressional crackdown on abusive
accounting practices by many of the largest companies, including some of
the same financial services companies that have lobbied strenuously for
the bankruptcy bill.""The timing couldn't be worse,"" said Travis B. Plunkett, the legislative
director of the Consumer Federation of America. ""It takes a lot of gall
for Congress to make a move like this when so many Americans are
concerned about corporate abuses, and when the economy is so shaky."" Senator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat who is a leading critic of
the bill, said today that ""it boggles the mind that at a time when
Americans are more economically vulnerable, when they are most in need
of protection from financial disaster, we would eviscerate the major
financial safety net in our society for the middle class.""Bankruptcy lawyers said that the bill would do harm to low- and
middle-income clients who would be saddled with debts that would take
them years to pay back. The new law will end the debt-free ""fresh start""
that many of those debtors had been permitted under the current law.Recent studies have shown that the average American filing for
bankruptcy has a median household income well below the national average
of about $42,000 in 2000. A study cited in Congressional testimony last
year showed that the average person filing for bankruptcy had a car that
was six to nine years old, and that a quarter of those people had
medical debts exceeding $1,000.""I won't deny that there are people who abuse the bankruptcy system,""
said Mr. Weltmann, the Washington lawyer whose firm calls itself the
Bankruptcy Center. ""But there are honest, hard-working folks who are
really going to be affected by these changes.""The bill would impose a means test on debtors, based on median incomes
in their home states, for bankruptcy filings under Charter 7 of the
federal bankruptcy law, which permits debtors to erase most of their
unsecured debts, like credit card bills.Debtors with an income above the state median would be barred from
filing under Chapter 7 and would instead be required to file instead
under Chapter 13, which requires that a portion of the unsecured debt be
repaid over time under the court-administered plan.Mr. Courson, the San Francisco lawyer, said that the changes would ""hurt
a lot of consumer debtors who really, rightfully belong in Chapter 7.""""My clients, for the most part, are honest and unfortunate people, and
they've just got heavy debt,"" he said. ""You can always find some
circumstance where a person really went to town with a credit card and
got themselves in trouble. But I have people who are just plain old
poor. My experience is something wildly different than the story that
the credit card companies make to Congress.""

At its peak, there were more than 100 peer-to-peer start-ups. There now
remain, at most, a couple of dozen companies concentrated in a few
niches. The main activity of companies venturing into peer to peer is
file sharing. But the dozens of overoptimistic forays into alternative
economic systems, hyper-sophisticated technologies, and recording
industry collaboration turned out to be dead ends.  Peer-to-peer
auctions, peer-to-peer supply chain management, and peer-to-peer e-mail
may have failed because they were ahead of their time. It's more likely
they failed because they were just ahead of themselves.  Clearly, the
public's appetite for file sharing has increased, and the state of the
art has improved dramatically. But companies have still not yet found
satisfactory business models, thus leaving file sharing's last chapter
unwritten.

XML proxies are add-ons to firewall and network environments that have
the ability to monitor XML traffic and apply business rules and IT
policies such as security, routing, performance, management,
transformation, and connection provisioning.  Current firewalls aren't
able to peek in the envelope and decipher XML traffic, said report
author Ronald Schmelzer, ZapThink senior analyst.  XML proxies are not
only able to understand network protocols, but also the XML-based
content traveling on top of those protocols, Schmelzer said.  ZapThink
identifies a slew of new vendors with XML-ready security solutions,
including Flamenco Networks, Forum Systems, Reactivity, Vordel, and
Westbridge Technology, among others... ZapThink estimates that XML
represents just 2 percent of network traffic today, but that will
increase to almost 25 percent by 2006.

"> I may be dense, but why would anyone want to utilize Habeus?  To
> me, it looks like a potential backdoor to anyone's defenses against spam.You're not dense. I'm going to zero the habeas scores on my copy of
SpamAssassin. I think they were added to SA quite prematurely. To me it's
simple:1. People who send me legitimate email have absolutely no motivation to use
Habeas, at least until it gets lots more press, and even then only
bulk-mailing companies like Amazon or eBay are going to bother, and I
already whitelist them. Individuals won't bother.2. Spammers have lots of motivation to forge the Habeas headers, and a good
percentage of them are completely out of the legal reach of Habeas.I think it should be subjected to the same testing and scrutiny as any other
potential new rule. When I test against my corpus here's what I get:OVERALL     SPAM  NONSPAM     S/O   SCORE  NAME
  13851     8919     4932    0.64    0.00  (all messages)
      0        0        0    0.00   -1.00  HABEAS_SWEThe score of -1.0 is pretty harmless right now, but it still looks like a
useless rule so far.--

"> Who loses in this case? Why? Neither party is inaccurate in their

on some website that gives me free access to a large compilation of data, 
and in so doing have subscribed myself to their mailing list. The mailing 
includes a list of new articles and books and so forth as well as a few 
links to their book store.This is consistently flagged as spam, even though I *agreed* to see it, 
and I *want* to see what new articles there are, since some of them might 
be interesting. Thus, since it is certifiably *not* spam (it even 
includes a link to terminate your account), I revoke it. Even so, the 
next mail is still flagged as spam.Who is losing a trust rating here? If it is not unsolicited commercial e-
mail, it should not be reported by Razor as spam -- correct?--Will

">>>>> ""S"" == Stephen D Williams  writes:    S> A) Which religion is it that can claim no foul actions in its
    S> past?  Certainly not Christianity, Islam, etc.Rastafari.That is, if you concede that of the two founding branches, only the
one founded by the Nyabingi were legit and the others were
thinly-veneered anti-colonial hooligans.  There is also Vietnamese Buddhism, unless you count setting fire to
oneself as a ""foul action"".    S> C) Many splinter Christianity religions have 'clean hands' but
    S> they also aren't 'found in the wild'.You'd have to explain ""found in the wild"".  For example, I know of
no violence perpetrated by the South Pacific ""Cargo Cults"" outside
of a pretty darn /mean/ game of cricket.    S> D) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud, recently
    S> more or less concluded, is not completely unlike this kind of
    S> friction generated by splitting society too much along
    S> religious lines.  One Post article pointed out that the problem
    S> basically stemmed from the vertical integration of areas along
    S> religious lines all the way to schools, government, political
    S> party, etc.  (Of course both cases have a heritage of British
    S> conquest, but who doesn't?)When we launched the Native Net in 1989, one of the first things we
noticed on networking aboriginal groups around the world is that the
British Army, with the US Army as a proxy by extension, were the
common thread.  Where neither was present (physically or through
influence) there /tended/ to be less violence.The issue in Ireland is complex, but rest assured that religious
aspects are only a co-incidence of the invader/colonials being
predominantly members of the Royal-headed Anglicans and the aboriginal
population being predominantly members of the Pope-headed Catholics.
The conflict itself has nothing to do with ideology or practice, since
the Anglican Church is a near-identical clone of Catholicism.(now I bet that's going to attract some healthy debate ;)    S> .. most Protestants are unionists who want the
    S> province to remain part of Britain.Mebst. Mebst.  It's the other way around.  Most Unionists are protestants.
It's their _Unionism_ that is the source of the conflict, not their
sacriments.    S> ... Police records and historians agree that the most lethal
    S> group by far was the IRA, fighting on the Catholic side with a
    S> goal of a united IrelandAnd which side of the colonial fence do you suppose the Police and
Historians sit?  If the Russians had invaded the USA as feared in
episodes such as the Bay of Pigs, would the Americans have organized
to become a ""lethal force"", or would they have just said, ""Oh well,
there goes /that/ democracy!"" and settle in under communist rule?Just wondering.    >> 2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.It is interesting to me that the Canadian media is trying to paint
Chretien as some sort of buffoon for saying that 3rd-world poverty was
a major contributor to 9-11.  If they'd /watch/ his now-infamous
interview, they'd see that it's still us-against-hooligans, but his
point is that the hooligans would not be able to find friendly states
so easily if those states were not so bled-dry by the west.The same is true of street-gangs: When people are disenfranchised,
it's easier to offer them the Triad as a new family.  You get
cellphones, cars, a dry place to live.  Triad, biker gangs, mafia, the
IRA, Al Queda ... we've been fighting the War on Terrorism for as long
as there's been commerce, so you'd think we'd /realize/ that
escalation of violence is not a solution.--

"review : torrego , the dependencies of objects . torrego , esther , ( 1998 ) , the dependencies of objects . linguistic inquiry monograph 34 . cambridge , massachusetts : the mit press . 197 pages . reviewed by alex alsina , universitat pompeu fabra ( barcelona ) . this book is a study of overtly case-marked objects in spanish that pays attention to similar phenomena in other languages , particularly other romance languages . it is well-known that direct objects , or accusative objects , in spanish , when expressed as full nps , or dps ( to use the author 's term ) , alternate between two forms depending on various semantic and syntactic properties : dps withouth any overt case morphology , and overtly case-marked dps . the overt case marker in question is the preposition "" a "" , which also marks dative objects . the study adopts the minimalist program , outlined by chomsky ( 1992 , 1994 , 1995 ) , as a framework for developing an analysis for the various phenomena under investigation . synopsis chapter 1 outlines the theoretical framework of the book and sketches the content of the subsequent chapters . chapter 2 presents the various generalizations that characterize spanish accusative objects marked by the dative preposition . among these generalizations are correlations between overt case-marking and specificity , between overt case-marking and telicity , between overt case-marking and an interpretation of the subject as an agent or a cause , etc . the common element in the explanation of all of these generalizations is the idea that the marked accusative object raises overtly to a position outside vp , to the specifier position of the functional category v , which takes the vp as its complement . for example , the two following facts are observed : marked accusative requires ( or may require ) a telic interpretation of the event which is absent with unmarked accusative objects , and an affected interpretation of the ( animate ) object requires overt case-marking on the object . it is suggested that objects moved outside the vp have a delimiting role for their predicates and , at the same time , the position to which objects moved , the spec of vp , is the locus of affectedness . thus , two different properties of overt case-marking would be made to follow from the idea that overtly case-marked objects in spanish undergo overt movement to spec of vp . likewise , the observation that overt case-marking on the object requires the subject to be interpreted as an agent or as a cause is linked to the idea that an overtly case-marked object is in spec-v p and to the hypothesis that the causative or agent role is assigned to the v - vp configuration . torrego proposes that there are two types of marked accusatives , one with structural case and the other with inherent case . marked accusative is inherent with causative and agentive verbs and those with affected objects , and is structural with other verbs . this theoretical difference is appealed to in order to account for an asymmetry with respect to extraction out of marked accusative objects : such extractions are ill-formed with the former class of verbs , but not with the latter . the presence of the extra structure created by the inherent case marker is a crucial element in the explanation of this contrast . chapter 3 examines variation in causative structures in spanish and argues that this variation is largely conditioned by case assignment . much of the discussion is based on a causative structure in which the causee appears between the causative verb "" hacer "" ' make ' and the infinitive . one of the goals of the chapter is to explain the restrictions on the "" faire-par "" causative in several spanish dialects . in these dialects , the "" faire-par "" causative is only fully acceptable in the following situations : ( 1 ) when an object clitic is present , or ( 2 ) when a reflexive clitic is present , and that , otherwise they are best with verbs identified as "" constructive accomplishments "" such as ' build ' or with case-marked objects . chapter 4 analyzes constructions with dative objects , both with ditransitive verbs and with unaccusatives . restrictions regarding constructions with two objects with identical case-marking are examined . the chapter also deals with contrasts between the presence and absence of doubling clitics . a comparison is made with the double object constructions in english . an analysis is presented of the contrast in raising constructions with 's eem ' between those without the dative argument ( acceptable ) and those with it ( unacceptable ) . conclusions are briefly summarized at the end . critical discussion this book is a mine of linguistic puzzles concerning objects , causative constructions , clitics , and related phenomena in spanish . it is of interest to anyone concerned with these matters , regardless of what analysis and what theoretical framework one may wish to adopt . this book is also of interest to linguists who want to find out how the minimalist program can be applied to a particular empirical domain . the author has done a great job of synthesizing the data and presenting generalizations that need to be explained . despite these positive aspects of the book , i experienced serious frustrations while reading it having to do with the data and with the analysis . data the problem with the data , which is a minor one compared to the other one , has to do with the fact that many of the data presented are alien to the varieties of spanish that i speak or am familiar with . naturally , i cannot claim to know all varieties of spanish , so i should not be surprised to discover data that do not belong to the spanish that i know . some examples follow . torrego presents a contrast in pp . 58-59 between "" a quienes ( les ) vieron ? "" and "" a quienes ( * los ) vieron ? "" , but both forms are equally ill-formed for me when the clitic ( the form in parentheses ) is included . the example "" la guerra los hizo subir "" in page 101 is claimed to allow only an animate reading for the clitic "" los "" , although for me it also allows an inanimate reading , but then this fact is claimed to hold only in spanish dialects where the pre-infinitival causee with "" hacer "" and an intransitive verb is attested , and i find this causative structure highly marginal ( examples such as "" la maestra hizo a los alumnos subir "" ) . and the construction exemplified by sentences such as "" me hizo pedir yo , "" which is analyzed in this book , is also alien to me . the main problem with these numerous discrepancies about the data is that it makes it hard to evaluate when a difference in the interpretation of the data is due to a difference in the data ( that may not be obvious ) or to a possible misanalysis of what actually is the same data . to illustrate this , consider the argument given in support of the claim that the structure embedded under "" hacer "" in a sentence like "" la guerra hizo subir los precios "" is a single unit ( p . 102 ) . torrego claims that standard constituency tests indicate that the sequence "" subir los precios "" in this sentence is a constituent and provides examples such as the following in support of this claim : ( 38 ) a . lo que la guerra hizo es subir los precios . what the war caused is to rise the prices d . que ha hecho la guerra sino subir los precios ? what has the war caused except rising the prices ? for me the translation of these sentences is not as indicated in the glosses , but rather as "" what the war did is to raise the prices . "" and "" what has the war done but raise the prices ? "" for ( 38a ) and ( 38d ) respectively . i would tend to believe that torrego is playing on the polysemy of "" hacer "" and "" subir "" . "" hacer "" can be either the causative verb meaning ' cause ' or ' make ' or the generic transitive verb translatable as 'd o ' , and "" subir "" can be either intransitive , equivalent to ' rise ' , or transitive , equivalent to ' raise ' . for the examples in ( 38 ) to be relevant to torrego 's claim , "" hacer "" must be causative and "" subir "" intransitive . what makes these exemples acceptable ( even though not perfect ) for me is that "" subir "" can be taken to be a transtive verb , whose unexpressed subject is coreferential with "" la guerra "" . but , under this interpretation , "" hacer "" would not be functioning as the causative verb , but as the counterpart of 'd o ' . what shows conclusively that , in my variety of spanish , this interpretation is right is that , if , instead of "" subir "" , we use a verb that only has an intransitive use , we get an unacceptable result . "" caer "" ' fall ' is such a verb : even though the sequence "" caer los precios "" can appear following the causative verb "" hacer "" , as in "" la guerra hizo caer los precios , "" it cannot appear as a focused or topicalized constituent of this verb , as we see in ( i ) . ( i ) a . * lo que la guerra hizo es caer los precios . what the war did / caused is to fall the prices b . * que ha hecho la guerra sino caer los precios ? what has the war done / caused except falling the prices ? > from this i would conclude that torrego 's data in ( 38 ) do not provide any evidence for the claim that a sequence such as "" subir los precios "" in a causative construction is a constituent , because those examples do not include the causative verb "" hacer "" . of course , i can only reach this conclusion for the variety of spanish that i am familiar with , where ( i ) is ungrammatical . but , for all i know , the examples in ( i ) could be grammatical in the variety of spanish analyzed by torrego , in which case my conclusion would not apply and the examples in ( 38 ) would constitute relevant evidence for the claim under investigation . analysis my second difficulty with this book is in the analysis ( or analyses ) provided . i have trouble understanding many of the analyses given : in many cases , i fail to derive the predictions that should follow from the analysis , i cannot tell what would constitute a counterexample to the analysis , i cannot figure out what role a given assumption plays in the analysis , etc . this could well be due to a deficiency on my part , but other readers might experience the same difficulties . next , i will point out some problem cases . 1 . chapter 2 of the book starts out with a list of six generalizations about marked accusative ( pp . 14-16 ) : ( 1 ) marked accusative can cooccur with doubling clitics in some dialects ( it is a necessary condition for clitic doubling ) , ( 2 ) marked accusative objects are interpreted as specific , ( 3 ) telicity requires marked accusative ( with animate objects ) , ( 4 ) the subject in a clause with a marked accusative object is an agent or a cause , ( 5 ) marked accusative is restricted to animates , and ( 6 ) affected animate objects require marked accusative . the indications given all along are that these generalizations will follow from a unified analysis . the main idea underlying this analysis is that an object with marked accusative raises to the specifier position of the functional category v , which takes a vp as its complement . ideally , an overt movement operation of this kind should have some testable effects on word order and all of the properties of the construction should follow straightforwardly from this operation . however , as torrego notes , there is no visible effect of object raising on word order , so that the motivation for the analysis rests entirely on how well it explains the generalizations listed above . and these generalizations are explained by attributing the various properties that correlate with overt case-marking to the spec of v - vp position on a one-by - one basis . for example , it is proposed that the spec of v - vp has a specific interpretation , that the presence of an object in spec of v - vp may shift the aspect of the predicate to a telic situation , that the presence of an object in spec of v - vp gives an agentive interpretation to the subject , etc . one wonders why this analysis should be preferable to one that attributes all of these properties directly to overt case-marking : in both cases , a one-by - one stipulation of those properties is required . it is not clear what the advantage is in attributing these properties to a special phrase structure position for which very weak evidence is given . 2 . in pp . 23 ff , torrego claims that there are two types of marked accusative : marked accusative of non-affected objects is structural case , whereas marked acusative of affected objects is inherent case . however , this claim is faced with a major problem that torrego notes , but then simply disregards . inherent ( or quirky ) case has the generally accepted property that it is preserved under passivization : an argument with inherent case does n't lose or change its case marking when its clause is passivized . genitive and dative case in icelandic are a good example of this , and dative case in spanish is also a good example of case marking that does not change from active to passive . however , the marked accusative case of affected objects in spanish is not preserved ( see relevant examples in p . 28 ) . torrego notes that , in contrast with spanish , some hindi dialects preserve the accusative "" - ko "" marking in passives , citing mohanan 1990 . torrego then goes on to say ( p . 29 ) : "" if the marked accusative of "" affected "" objects were inherent , overt marking in passivization could be preserved ( just as the marking of datives and genitives is preserved in icelandic passives ) . it remains to be seen whether relevant data from the dialects of hindi confirm this expectation . "" but the relevant data from the dialects of hindi does confirm this expectation , as the examples from mohanan 1990 ( also mohanan 1994 ) show . if we agree that we identify inherent case because its case marking is preserved under passivization , then we must conclude that marked accusative case is inherent in some dialects of hindi , because its case marking does not change under passivization , but is structural in the other dialects of hindi , where it does change under passivization . and we are forced to conclude that it is structural in spanish because it is not preserved under passivization . to ignore this evidence and still conclude that marked accusative case can be inherent case in spanish is to devoid the distinction between structural case and inherent case of the conceptual and empirical substance that it is standardly asociated with . and torrego does not explicitly reject this association . 3 . the agentivity effect of clauses with marked accusative is explained as follows : following a suggestion of chomsky 's ( 1995 ) , the causative or the agent role can be understood as the interpretation assigned to the v - vp configuration ; since marked accusative is assigned to objects that raise to spec of vp , the presence of marked accusative implies the existence of the v - vp configuration . therefore , whenever there is marked accusative , there must be an agentive or causative interpretation . but what happens with verbs that allow an alternation between marked and unmarked accusative on the object ? this should mean that such verbs should alternate between a v - vp configuration and some other configuration , but this second option is not spelled out . also , we have no way of knowing what consequences the presence or absence of the v - vp configuration has other than on overt case marking and on the corelation between overt case marking and other properties such as agentivity . 4 . in pp . 34 ff . , torrego tries to relate the idea that marked accusative on affected objects is lexical quirky case to grimshaw 's ( 1990 ) theory of quirky case - marking . in grimshaw 's theory , arguments at argument structure are ranked by prominence in two tiers : the aspectual tier and the thematic tier . adopting this theory , torrego proposes ( p . 36 ) that "" an argument ( subject or object ) can be lexically or quirky marked when it has thematic or aspectual prominence relative to the other argument . "" it is unclear how one is to interpret this proposal . prominence is a comparative property : a is more or less prominent than b . to say that a has prominence relative to b is either meaningless or would be true of any pair of arguments in an argument structure : it is necessarily true of any pair of arguments a and b of an argument structure that a is in a prominence relation to b . torrego goes on to state : "" the two arguments of an agentive telic transitive verb are both aspectually prominent . "" but this should be true of all transitive verbs . torrego goes on to conclude : "" this approach covers the fact that the object of only agentive and caustive verbs can or must be lexically or quirky case - marked , and also covers the fact that the overall phenomenon of marked accusative case happens with verbs that have agentive subjects . "" i fail to see how these predictions are derived . 5 . regarding the animacy restriction on overtly case - marked objects , torrego proposes that the term "" actor "" is more appropriate to characterize the class of nominals that appear in marked accusative than the term "" animate "" . the motivation for this terminological change is found in the existence of some expressions denoting inanimate entities that can take overt case - marking , as in the following example ( p . 55 ) : ( 45 ) el acido afecta ( a ) los metales . ' acid affects metals . ' ( i suspect that the presence of marked accusative in this example has more to do with the verb than with the semantics of the object . ) torrego does not propose a definition of "" actor "" , but refers the reader to jackendoff 's ( 1983 ) characterization of "" actor "" as the character in an action-type event that performs the action . given this characterization , it is hard to see how "" los metales "" ' the metals ' in example ( 45 ) can be interpreted as the argument that performs the action of the event ; what would "" el acido "" ' the acid ' be , then ? torrego goes on to say : "" the distinction between "" animates "" ( or "" actor "" - like nominals ) and "" inanimates "" does not appear to be semantic in nature . "" this is an odd claim to make , given that the notion of "" actor , "" which is proposed to replace "" animate , "" is given a semantic characterization . the motivation for this claim , however , is found in the fact that certain expressions , specifically proper names of humans , can be used to refer to anything , from a boat to a magazine to a can of beer , and always require overt case morphology , as in the following example : ( 46 ) esconde * ( a ) barbara . ' hide barbara . ' it is suggested that a purely morphological property underlies overt case - marking , although no indication is given as to what this morphological property might be . possibly the most robust generalization about overt case - marking of objects in spanish is that it is restricted to "" animates "" , even though there are problem cases such as example ( 45 ) and "" personified "" expressions such as ( 46 ) . because of these problems , torrego gives no explanation for the correlation between case - marking and animate interpretation and between absence of case - marking and inanimate interpretation that we see in pairs such as ( ii ) and ( iii ) : ( ii ) a . esconde a este . ( ' hide this one ( male animate entity ) . ' ) b . esconde este . ( ' hide this one ( inanimate entity ) . ' ) ( iii ) a . veremos a otra . ( ' we shall see another one ( female animate entity ) . ' ) a . veremos otra . ( ' we shall see another one ( inanimate entity ) . ' ) general remarks torrego often appeals to intuition in the exposition of the analysis and does not work out the details of the analysis . the following remark , very reminiscent of chomsky 's style , illustrates this point ( p . 139 , end of 3rd par . ) : "" whatever the details of this intuitive account are , the general approach seems quite plausible . "" if one does not work out the details of an account , it is not possible to derive predictions from it , and therefore the theory is unfalsifiable . this work by torrego is part of a move towards deriving explanations from very general and simple principles that interact in complex ways with each other . this move is a welcome one , but we should be careful that it does not land us in vagueness and imprecision . there is a style of explanation in which appeal is made to principles , often unstated or imprecisely stated principles , from which predictions are claimed to follow , but in which the derivation of predictions ( the logical steps from which predictions follow ) is not worked out and it is not possible to know what a prediction of the theory really is and what a counterexample to the theory might be . there is a danger that a reader of torrego 's "" the dependencies of objects "" might have the impression that the explanations in this book are of this style . to prevent this impression , torrego should have made a greater effort in terms of exposition ( even if it means leading the reader by the hand ) to show how the various predictions are derived . for that , it is necessary to state the crucial principles explicitly , as numbered items so the reader can refer to them easily , to make the assumptions about representations also explicit , and to give step-by - step derivations of the various predictions . references chomsky , noam . 1992 . a minimalist program for linguistic theory . mit working papers in linguistics , no . 1 . chomsky , noam . 1994 . bare phrase structure . mit occasional papers in linguistics , no . 5 . chomsky , noam . 1995 . the minimalist program . mit press . grimshaw , jane . 1990 . argument structure . mit press . jackendoff , ray . 1983 . semantics and cognition . mit press . mohanan , tara . 1990 . arguments in hindi . ph . d . dissertation , stanford university . mohanan , tara . 1994 . argument structure in hindi . stanford : csli publications . reviewer : alex alsina , professor titular d ' universitat , faculty of translation and interpretation , universitat pompeu fabra , barcelona , spain . ph . d . , stanford university , 1993 . research interests include syntax , morphology , morphosyntax , argument structure , linguistic theory . reviewer 's address : alex alsina facultat de traduccio i interpretacio universitat pompeu fabra la rambla , 30-32 08002 barcelona spain alex . alsina @ trad . upf . es",Safe Email

"http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/scripts/editorial2.cgi?cid=news&aid=481620Close encounter of burnt kindIT came from outer space Â­ or did it? Teenager Siobhan Cowton is convinced
the object which struck her as she climbed into the family car at her home
in Northallerton is extra-terrestrial.
But while her claims are being treated with a certain amount of studied
academic scepticism by experts in these matters, the 14-year-old schoolgirl
is adamant she was hit on the foot by a meteorite.
Siobhan initially thought there was a more prosaic explanation Â­ that the
odd-looking stone had been thrown at her by a child,.
But on closer inspection, she discovered all was not as it seemed Â­ because
it was hot when she picked it up. It hit her on a foot but caused no injury.
""I looked at it again and it had a black and grey colour with a shiny bubble
surface,"" she said.
After closer inspection by her father Niel, and comparison with pictures on
the Internet, Siobhan plans to ask scientists at Durham University to check
the object for authenticity.
If it is from outer space, Siobhan says she will consider putting it up for
auction.
She added: ""If it isn't worth anything then I suppose I will keep it myself
for sentimental value. It is not every day that you are hit by a meteorite.""
But Dr Ben Horton, a lecturer in physical geography, was the acme of
academic caution.
""Meteors have features that can be used to establish whether it is a piece
of extraterrestrial rock,"" he said.
""They have a very smooth surface but sometimes they have shallow depressions
and cavities. If they are hot, they should have a black ash like crust burnt
around the edge.
""Most are between five and 60 centimetres but five centimetres is the
smallest that they usually appear.""
To establish the provenance of Siobhan's suspected meteorite it would have
to be subject to a mineral breakdown but Dr Horton thinks the chances of it
being extra-terrestrial are slim.
""Around 50,000 a year strike the Earth's surface and, considering the size
of the Earth, it is very unlikely to be a meteorite.
""However, there is a possibility and there is no reason it couldn't happen,""
he added. ------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

"intelligent industrial automation ( iia ' 99 ) third international icsc symposia on intelligent industrial automation ( iia ' 99 ) http : / / www . icsc . ab . ca / iia99 . htm and soft computing ( soco ' 99 ) http : / / www . icsc . ab . ca / soco99 . htm june 1 - 4 , 1999 at the palazzo ducale in genova , italy introduction the international symposia on intelligent industrial automation ( iia ' 99 ) and soft computing ( soco ' 99 ) intend to encompass short-to - long-term effects of advanced information technology , soft computing and other related ' intelligent technolgies ' in application fields such as industrial automation , control , diagnostics , computer vision , robotics , speech recognition and machine translation . the general aim of the symposia is to address and underline the existing and emerging relationships between automation , manufacturing and intelligent technolgies , with particular emphasis on soft computing . contributions are sought on intelligent automation and manufacturing with emphasis on current and potential applications , with a broad interest in all the engineering disciplines , computer science and related technology fields . following the success of iia / soco ' 96 ( reading , england ) and iia / soco ' 97 ( nmes , france ) , the third symposium will be held in genova , italy . the iia / soco series have established themselves as a platform for scientists and practitioners from academic , governmental and industrial institutions to discuss new developments and results in the field of intelligent technologies . a further follow-up conference has already been scheduled for the year 2001 in paisley , scotland . purpose of iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 advances in soft computing and related techniques : theory and applications . ait ( advanced information technology ) is one of the major technological drivers in the advancement of modern society . nowadays any major achievement , related to any field of research , is strongly supported by proper ait based tools . very often , such achievements have only been possible after a proper ait approach has been designed and implemented . it is widely known that ait has a very strong impact on society itself , radically changing the skills and competencies required in order to contribute to the everyday human environment . given that nowadays the major effort in ait development is spent in the so called ' soft - computing ' arena and that some of the major and indeed , surprising , achievements in industrial applications come from the application of soft-computing techniques , the two symposia ( iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 ) will have many common areas of interest , namely : - neural networks - fuzzy logic - genetic algorithms - chaos theory - ai and expert systems - machine learning - pattern recognition and image understanding the programs of the two conferences will , however , reflect different themes : - iia ' 99 will be directed toward the medium-to - short term , application driven , research area in intelligent technologies . - soco ' 99 is directed toward the long term research in area of soft computing in order to try to overcome the usual borderline existing between theory and application , the two symposia are run jointly , organized in a way to have partial overlap with some joint sessions and some common plenary sessions . aim of iia ' 99 / soco ' 99 1 . to give both a wide and a deep view of advances in ait advancement offered by soft-computing technologies . 2 . to give both the industrial and academic researcher the opportunity to discuss together real problems and opportunities . 3 . to collect ' best practice ' and information on how to perform experiments , tests and design products and processes embedding and / or using soft-computing technologies . 4 . to explicitly and actively function as a ' technology broker ' , giving the opportunity for people to become aware of new problems and possible solutions and giving the possibility of finding technological partners for joint research and / or future application programs . topics of iia ' 99 iia ' 99 will include contributions in the research area of soft computing application and , more in general , related to medium-to - short term and application driven developments advanced information technology and industrial intelligent technology . particular emphasis will be laid on industrial realization , experimental application , application methodology development and / or formalization , quantitative and qualitative problem modeling . contributions are sought mainly in the areas based on the list below : a ) industrial area - industry - energy - transportation - services - consumer - etc . b ) high - tech area - innovative control and diagnostics - computer vision - robotics and remote sensing - speech recognition and machine translation - etc . c ) green - tech area - intelligent resource management - intelligent pollutant management - user behavior modeling - intelligent traffic control - etc . topics of soco ' 99 soco ' 99 will include contributions on long term research ( theory development , enhanced approaches , formal methods comparisons , applications , etc . ) in the area of soft-computing . contributions are sought in areas based on the list below , which is indicative only . - neural networks - fuzzy logic - rough sets - genetic algorithms and evolutionary computing - chaos theory - ai and expert systems - probabilistic reasoning - machine learning - learning algorithms and intelligent control - pattern recognition and image understanding - distributed intelligence - self - organizing systems - fuzzy databases and information retrieval - educational aspects of soft computing special session a special session on ' intelligent systems in control and process optimization ' including a plenary lecture is sponsored by the ifs network and organized by alberto servida , italy . contributions are welcome . conference location the symposia will be held at the palazzo ducale , a beautiful historic building in the city centre of genova , italy sponsors iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 are sponsored by : -

"fw : pma ' s bill , the following is a message that heather sent to me after we talked about this deal and she did some additional research . a synopsis of this deal : geir entered the deal on 4 - 24 - 01 . buy $ 320 , sell $ 30 , creating a $ 290 . 00 per mw charge to your books you went back on 4 - 27 - 01 and corrected the sel price to $ 300 , changing the $ 290 . 00 charge to your books to a $ 20 per mw charge to your book . since this is an intra - month change , portland risk should recognize this when the compare it to their liqrec report and they should recognize a $ 108 , 000 credit back in your pma ' s .

Venture Capitalists Are Taking the Gloves Off
By LYNNLEY BROWNINGThe venture capital world is looking less like a genteel club and more like
a brawling barroom.Venture capitalists are offering the companies they bankroll increasingly
hard-knuckled deals that leave little wealth for a start-up's managers or
original backers. The moves are leading some entrepreneurs, desperate for
money, to decry today's investors as bullies. Some venture capitalists are
even suing rival venture firms, asserting that the tough new terms are
wiping out the value of their previous investments.""People are playing hardball,"" said Ted Dintersmith, a general partner at
Charles River Ventures, based in Waltham, Mass.The bursting of the Internet stock bubble more than two years ago wiped out
many venture investments in dot-coms. Now, amid the bear market in stocks
and limited prospects for investors or young companies to make money soon,
venture capitalists are looking for novel ways to make money. As a result,
""private companies are facing the most onerous terms from venture
capitalists that we have seen in 20 years,"" said Steven E. Bochner, a
securities lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in Palo Alto, Calif.,
who represents venture firms.In the boom of the late 1990's, venture capitalists chose one of two
options. They could be paid back their invested capital, share in profits
and receive dividends. Or they could convert their preferred shares into
common stock when the private company held an initial public offering or
was sold. During that time of huge payouts for newly public and acquired
companies, they usually chose No. 2.But with markets now all but dead for initial public offerings and mergers
and acquisitions, venture capitalists from Silicon Valley to the East Coast
are increasingly demanding - and getting - both options. This ""double dip,""
known as ""participating preferred,"" leaves far less potential wealth for a
company's founders and previous investors. Venture capitalists are also
negotiating more deals with heightened ""liquidation preferences,"" in which
start-ups agree to pay back the initial investment at least two or three
times over.Previously, venture capitalists handed over money to a start-up in a lump
sum. But more are now parceling out funds in tranches, and then only when
the new companies reach certain milestones - a sales target, for example,
or the hiring of a particular chief executive.They are even trying to protect their investments through veto rights that
permit them to block future investments from other venture capitalists who
might dilute their stakes, said Mark G. Borden, chairman of the corporate
department at Hale & Dorr, a law firm based in Boston. As a result, Mr.
Borden said, a start-up company that casts its lot with a particular
venture capitalist or group of investors may find itself tethered to those
backers and unable to raise new money elsewhere.ENTREPRENEURS particularly dislike one recent trend: venture capitalists
have been pushing young companies to agree, retroactively, to lower the
prices that investors now pay for shares should the start-up be worth less
when it tries to raise more money later. Such a move, known as a ""full
ratchet,"" is intended to prevent an investor's stake from being diluted.
But it can significantly reduce or even wipe out the stakes of a company's
original investors and managers, giving the new investors most of the
company for a song.""If you were in the first round of investors, you generally now get
crushed"" when a start-up raises more money later, said J. Edmund Colloton,
general partner and chief operating officer of Bessemer Venture Partners,
based in Wellesley Hills, Mass.Consider Mahi Networks, a private optical networking start-up. In three
rounds of financing, from September 1999 to November 2001, Mahi raised $110
million from blue-chip venture firms like Benchmark Capital, Sequoia
Capital, the GE Capital unit of General Electric and the venture arm of
Goldman Sachs. At one point during the Internet boom, Mahi was valued at
more than $180 million.Last month, though, a new group of smaller-name investors, led by St. Paul
Venture Capital of Minneapolis, acquired about three-quarters of the
company for $75 million in financing. Before that, Mahi was valued at only
$25 million, said Chris Rust, Mahi's president and chief executive. But
most of that was tied up in employee incentives, including stock options,
leaving almost no value for existing investors.Despite having nurtured Mahi with money and advice, the early investors
chose not to back the company further. With the new, lower valuation,
""there was effectively no value attributed to all of our previous
investments,"" said one venture capitalist whose firm was an early backer.
""We were all completely washed out"" in the last round, said the investor,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.There is no hard data on the prevalence of the newer, tougher terms.
Venture capitalists are famously secretive about their deals, which are
private and largely unregulated. But ask venture capitalists or securities
lawyers who work with start-ups, and tales of onerous terms will abound.
""At the end of the day, the money is coming with strings attached,"" said
Mark G. Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association, a
trade group based in Arlington, Va.The shift has turned the conventional wisdom on its head. Venture
capitalists once loved risk, but no more. The Internet bust and Wall
Street's slump have left them scrambling to make money to repay their own
investors and to justify their management fees.Venture capitalists once clamored to be first in the door of a hot new
company. Now they can usually make money only by being the most recent
investor. ""We're certainly looking for later-stage deals, where you get the
benefit of the previous investors having taken the risk,"" said Todd Dagres,
a general partner at Battery Ventures in Wellesley, Mass.Some entrepreneurs agree to the harsh new terms simply because they have no
other way to raise cash to survive. But other managers now shun the
investors, whom they call ""vulture capitalists,"" bent on picking the meat
off a young or struggling start-up. Today's venture capitalists ""want to
take advantage of you,"" said George R. Waller, chief executive of Strike
Force Technologies, an employee-financed software maker in West Orange,
N.J. Mr. Waller said he had turned away 30 venture firms in recent months
because they had demanded, among other things, hard-to-reach sales
milestones.George J. Nassef, chief executive of ValetNoir, a start-up based in New
York that makes marketing software for casinos, said several venture firms
had even asked in recent months to have their potential investments secured
with receivables, or money owed to ValetNoir by its customers. He turned
them all down.NOT surprisingly, the shift in financing terms is upsetting some venture
firms that were early investors in start-ups but are now suffering as the
companies seek to raise additional money at bargain-basement prices.In one high-profile case, Benchmark Capital, a blue-chip Silicon Valley
firm, sued the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Juniper Financial
this month. Benchmark was an early investor in Juniper, an online financial
services concern, having put $20 million into it in early 2000, just before
the Internet bubble burst. It also contributed to a second, $94 million
round that September. Juniper, based in Wilmington, Del., is seeking to
raise $50 million from Canadian Imperial, which already owns around half
the company, but on terms that would sharply dilute Benchmark's original,
unspecified stake. Benchmark sued to prevent the start-up from raising the
money. All the parties declined to comment on the case, which a Delaware
judge threw out last week.Such friction was rare during the boom, when venture capitalists operated
like a competitive but tight-knit fraternity, channeling deals to one
another. Start-ups and their backers saw their interests as allied. But in
tighter markets, ""there's a lot of ugly behavior coming out,"" said Mr.
Bochner, the Wilson Sonsini lawyer. ""There's going to be much more
litigation like this.""

"Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated

the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but

hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I 
obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo /

something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I 
particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the

"Hi,I'm going to be using MySQL in an upcoming project (and probably
buying their support license), and I'm wondering if anyone else
has used any libraries to link a proprietary C++ project to a
MySQL database. From what I can see on the MySQL website, their
MySQL++ library is under the GPL, but there's also some documents
which list it as under the LGPL.Anyone got any experience with this, or has used a different
library to link C++ and MySQL under Linux?Regards,Vin

( source : company website ) currently trading at . 012 possibilty of an absolutely huge week as massive pr campaign has started and is expected to last all week . imagine how well your portfolio would have done the last month or so if you had the scoop on the following stock : ( otcbb : mbah ) : this stock closed at . 01 on september lst . this little giant closed at . 06 on october 8 th , up 500 % in about 5 weeks . do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon ? as many of you may agree , some , not all , of these stocks move in price because they are promoted , making a very large number of investors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp ! let ' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp about the company : delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration company that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres ( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all located over what management considers to be some of the most prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states . another 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are controlled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those found in north america . the management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry rayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration company to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of experience in the field of geology , along with running some of the most successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was the president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a market cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated with glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp minerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company moves forward . among the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30 years experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa , south america and the united states . while with gold fields mining corp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent drilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california . delta has experienced significant technical success since its start - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first in - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead kimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator minerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic diamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene . an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this under - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada . in bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia group of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other one - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to the independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further exploration is justified . delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also by acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and finance additional exploration . in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta controls , they also control a gold property with great potential . the property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an extensive exploration program .

"referencing example numbers in wp since the question has been raised about how to reference example numbers in wordperfect for dos , here 's my two-cents ' worth about wp5 . 1 and wp6 for dos . in 5 . 1 , although one could use paragraph numbers , as was suggested , this precludes using them to number sections of a paper . a better approach is to use the numbering facilities for "" graphics boxes . "" like paragraph numbers , graphics boxes can be referenced by the cross-reference feature in wp . what you have to do is set equation box options so that the caption is to the left of the box ( the default is to the right ) . for phonological rules , which can be nicely formatted using the equation editor , you then create an equation box with a caption consisting of "" ( [ box number ] ) "" and go into the equation editor to write the rule . for sample sentences , etc . , the box itself is empty , but with a caption as before , and set to allow text to overlap it . you can then exit the create graphics box screen and proceed to type the examples . the numbers automatically update as new boxes are added . cross - referencing is done by assigning name to any example you want to reference ( as a cross-reference target ) and then putting in a cross-reference reference code with the target 's name . you have to generate occasionally to update the reference numbers ; they initially appear as ? . in wp6 ( which is superior for linguistics because of its support for phonetic symbols ) it 's even easier . wp6 has a counters feature ( in the character format dialog box ) . you define a counter ( i call mine example ) . whenever you want to insert an example , you type ( in the main document screen ) the open parenthesis , go into the counters dialog box , and push f8 ( or click on the increment and display button ) . this inserts two codes : one to increment the number ( this is not done automatically for user-defined counters ) and one to display it . cross - referencing is done as before . a couple of additional wp tips : - the styles feature is very useful for dealing with in-text stylesheets for journals . for any feature where journals have different styles ( scare quotes , sentence glosses and translations , in-text reference punctuation , etc . ) you assign a style . styles can be any combination of characters and codes . for each journal , you create a different style library . then , if you want to change formatting from one to another , you simply read in a different style library . - the above is too simple for bibliography style sheets , where the order of elements differs in addition to punctuation and font attribute . if you are comfortable with programming , you can write merge programs ( called primary merge files in wp5 . 1 and merge form files in wp6 ) for the different stylesheets and have a bibliography file which is formatted as a secondary merge file ( wp5 . 1 ) / merge data file ( wp6 ) , with fields for things like author 's first and last names , year , title , etc . ( include a field for type of reference ( book , article , dissertation , etc . ) since the format of the title may vary . ) this is not recommended for computerphobes , however . - lining up foreign language examples with word-for - word glosses in proportional fonts can be done using tabs , and resetting the tab stops for each example . this is easier from wp6 . 0b onwards ( if you have a mouse ) because of the ruler feature : you display the ruler and drag the tab stops , and as you drag them a dotted line extends down from the tab stop through the text so you can see exactly where you are . in previous versions , you have to go into the tab set menu and play with the tab settings by trial and error . it is even possible to put asterisks inside the space of the tab between the example number and the example . instead of tabbing , use the tab align ( wp5 . 1 ) or decimal align ( wp6 ) feature ( ctrl f6 ) . before pressing ctrl - f6 , set the "" decimal character "" to the first letter of the example ( on the other format menu in 5 . 1 and the character format menu in 6 ) . to prevent the spell-checker from stopping on words in foreign examples ( or phonetic representations , or logical formulae ) , in 5 . 1 you can use the language feature to insert a made-up language code . the spell-checker will complain that it can't find the dictionary for the language , and you tell it to ignore the language and continue checking what it can . in wp6 a block can be marked [ speller / grammatik off ] ( on the other format menu ) to prevent it from being spell - or grammar-checked . - - yehuda n . falk department of english the hebrew university of jerusalem "" live long and prosper "" - vulcan greeting",Safe Email

Senate Committee Passes Nanotech Bill
By Roy MarkThe Senate Commerce Committee unanimously passed on Thursday legislation to
promote nanotechnology research and development. Introduced by Sen. Ron
Wyden (D-Ore.), the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act
would create the National Nanotechnology Research Program. The bill is
co-sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sen. George Allen (R-Va.).The proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that would
support long-term nanoscale research and development and promote effective
education and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchers
and professionals.""The unanimous support of the Senate Commerce Committee is a very big step
forward for this very small technology,"" Lieberman, who vowed to pushed to
full Senate passage before the end of the year, said. ""Nowhere in the world
are the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of
nanotechnology. The U.S. certainly possesses the raw resources and talent to
lead the world in developing this technology. Our legislation will provide
the nation with a long-term focus and sustained commitment, and facilitate
new collaborations between government, academia, and industry that will
ensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation.""The bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnology
program under the National Science and Technology Council. It would also
create a Presidential National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel and National
Nanotechnology Coordination Office, which would provide administrative and
technical support for the Advisory Panel and the Council.""My own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to
change America on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer
revolution. I am determined that the United States will not miss, but will
mine the opportunities of nanotechnology,"" Wyden said in introducing the
bill. ""At present, efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across a
half-dozen federal agencies. I want America to marshal its various
nanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world's leader
in this burgeoning field. And I believe federal support is essential to
achieving that goal.To study the potential long-term effects of nanotechnology, a new Center for
Societal, Ethical, Educational, Legal and Workforce Issues Related to
Nanotechnology would also be established.According to Lieberman, the bill closely tracks the recommendations of the
National Research Council (NRC), which completed a thorough review of the
National Nanotechnology Initiative in June.Those recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel;
emphasizing long-term goals; striking a balance between long-term and
short-term research; supporting the development of research facilities,
equipment and instrumentation; creating special funding to support research
that falls in the breach between agency missions and programs; promoting
interdisciplinary research and research groups; facilitating technology
transition and outreach to industry; conducting studies on the societal
implications of nanotechnology, including those related to ethical,
educational, legal and workforce issues; and the development of metrics for
measuring progress toward program goals.",Safe Email

should transmission projects be open to rfps ? is ferc open to market based pricing for expansions ? steve walton : the most important thing for ferc to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment . the rto debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled . for expansion to go forward , there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party . you are always going to have muddy issues in planning . for instance if a 138 kv line is all that is needed to day , but future considerations of scare right - of - way say a 345 kv line should be built , who pays for the extra cost . in order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process , appeal able to ferc , to decide such matters . discussion kevin kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose . most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding . michael dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution , i . e . least cost planning . this lead to discussion of the need for the rto to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions . commissioner massey asked about whether the system was ( a ) under built and needed lots of expansion so don ' t worry about overbuilding or ( b ) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities . the panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process . michaela dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions . laura manz felt that the term "" under built "" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties . dick o ' neil asked if lmp will work in the west . mark maher said it wouldn ' t . laura manz said it applies everywhere because of physics , they manage hydro facilities in pjm . michael dworkin said lmp means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed . bpa is looking pricing model but lmp won ' t work . steve walton said lmp needed for real time dispatch , but given the nature of the northwest hydro system it must have some "" tweaks "" like bilaterals and allow operator self - schedule output levels to permit river coordination . hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis . pjm has hydro , but not 70 % as in the northwest . implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal . in the summation at the end of the panel , four principles were listed : ( 1 ) rto must provide information , ( 2 ) rto should identify solutions , ( 3 ) rto should be unbiased and ( 4 ) the rto should be accountable . the disagreement was over the last two points , michael dworkin felt that # 3 ( unbiased ) was critical and that # 4 ( accountability ) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance . jose delgado said and transco can ' t be unbiased since it provides services , although the iso above it can be , but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake . this last point really comes down to a preference for iso over transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues . steve",Safe Email

they have managed to break, and why.But we really want exmh to operate with all the versions of nmh that
exist, don't we?   The patch to have exmh do the right thing, whether this
bug exists, or not, is trivial, so I'd suggest including it.Patch follows ...I have no idea why the sequences were being added after the message list
before, not that it should make any difference to nmh (or MH).   But since
I stopped doing that, the variable ""msgs"" isn't really needed any more,
rather than assigning $pick(msgs) to msgs, and then using $msgs the code
could just use $pick(msgs) where $msgs is now used.   This is just a
frill though, so I didn't change that.  kre--- pick.tcl	Fri Aug 23 16:28:14 2002

Razor and handled gracefully (logging to syslog or /dev/null), it'd be a
great help.As it stands, if the log file is unwritable, the razor check falls over
entirely as the constructor returns undef (unblessed reference = 'die'

> ChrisAfter sending the report I started fiddling with the Ftoc_RescanLine 
stuff and I havn't seen it since. I can't really tell if it was my 
hacking that removed it, or if it was some transitional magic 
happening since this was the first invocation of that version of 
exmh. I've backed out my stuff now, and'll let you know if it happens 
again.
On another thing with the Ftoc_RescanLine stuff. This routine is 
called at times still unclar to me. An inspection of the routine 
suggests that it is used in the transition of a message to/form 
""current"" state to re-paint the ftoc line. However, checking the 
msg.tcl code (MSgChange) we find:    if {$msgid != {}} {
        # Allow null msgid from Msg_ShowWhat, which supplies line 
instead
        if {$msgid < 0}  return
    } else {
        # line null too, try using first in folder
        if {[string length $line] == 0} { set line 1 }
        set msgid [Ftoc_MsgNumber [Ftoc_FindMsg $msgid $line]]
    }
    Ftoc_ClearCurrent
    Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msgid
    Ftoc_ShowSequences $exmh(folder)The Ftoc_ClearCurrent calls Ftoc_RescanLIne to clear the '+' sign 
_before_ the on-disk transition is made. I hacked this stuff and more 
or less changed the order. It works, but fails on some folder changes.My feeling of this is that we really do not want to have a 
Ftoc_ClearCurrent, but rather just a RescanLine and the caller had 
better know the line or msgid. That routine shoud just put in the '+' 
if the line/msg in question happened to be the cur msg. Thoughts?

"I develop software and my pricing is that I charge the first set of
customers that drive the features included quite a bit, then charge the
majority of the customers a small fee, and when I've earned back what I
invested (including my hourly wage) then I release that software for free
and either start working on a newer version (again back to the adding
features step) or on a new product. If you can't find someone willing to
pay your costs of development then most likely there really isn't a need
for the product you're trying to sell and you shouldn't develop it. If you
have to resort to free versions with lame ass ads and stuff then that is a
strong indication to get a new project IMO.  :)

"Hi All,Anyone ever try connecting at 1200bps in Linux? I've got a USR 56K
Faxmodem which is meant to connect to another (same) modem and I have to
connect at this speed due to the (NT) port settings on the remote side,
but the modem handshake always fails at this speed.The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to
~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote server
as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps.Note Minicom fails to handshake at 1200bps, but HyperTerm in Windows
worked first time(!?), any ideas?Baud 1200 7 data bits Even ParityI am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string:AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1... which is most of the defaults.USR said to set S15=128 (disables v.42)) 
& set S32=98 (disable v.92 & X2)But the S15=128 just makes the handshake lockup instead of just giving
up.btw this is a bank's system I am connecting to so reconfiguring their
modems may be difficult.Colin.

individuals do. Like group rights, ""disparity"" in wealth is
statistical sophistry.
Besides, even if you can't help the distribution, industrial wealth
is almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when
there are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes
400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still there
since 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on
wealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point,
they're nowhere near the top.I'll take those odds. It is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself,
in the form of government regulation, confiscatory taxes, legislated
monopoly, corporate welfare, ""non-profit"" neoaristocratic tax dodges,
and legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress, like
what happened in Fabian-era Britain, or 1970's USA.In fact, it is in countries where wealth is the most ""unfairly""
distributed, that you get the most improvement in the general --
economic -- welfare. More stuff cheaper, fewer people dying, more
people living longer.I'll take those odds as well. People take greater risks when the
returns are higher, improving the lot of us all as a result.Cheers,

hmm. there are versions of OpenBSD that run from a 32M compact flash IIRC.and antefacto's software ran in 64M.there are CF->IDE adapters anyway, so get a 256M CF (100â‚¬+), mount it RO,
and use that?/me is also in the market for one of the 60W fanless PSU's that antefacto had,
if someone wants to get a few of them.L.

and it is becoming acceptable to get in peoples face and shout them down
when you disagree with them.  The people that do this are NOT
disenfranchised. They
get their rocks off on being disagreeable assholes. The act of protesting is
more important than the actual issue being protested for most of these

  Stephen> this?This topic comes up every so often on this list.  The short answer is 
no, there really isn't an IMAP server which knows how to do this.The longer answer is, UW-IMAP claims it does, but doesn't do a good 
job, and doesn't update scan caches, unseen, etc.You may have better luck while on the road using raw mh commands to 
read you e-mail if you have ssh access to your internal environment.
I've been doing this for quite a long time, and, after the learning 
curve of the mh command set (which I still don't know completely),
I'm quite able to access my e-mail and respond to those e-mails which 
require a response.Another option is using mutt as your mail client when you're remotely 
accessing e-mail.  Mutt does a decent job of dealing with mh folders, 
though it doesn't update scan caches or unseen files either.  But it 
is a decent interface alternative to raw mh, and it's quite 
customizable.The real answer to your question is that we need not an IMAP server 
that understands mh folders, but an mh server to which a local client 
could connect to.  In theory, it shouldn't be too hard (technically) 
to cobble this together with ssh.  Replace all of exmh's calls to mh 
commands with a wrapper which uses ssh to lob these commands over to 
a remote system, and dump the output back into the local exmh client.-- Seeya,
Paul

Hash: SHA1I may be dense, but why would anyone want to utilize Habeus?  To me, it looks 
like a potential backdoor to anyone's defenses against spam.If I were a spammer, I'd simply set up a server, send out my spam with the 
Habeus headers and continue till I was reasonably certain I'd been reported.  
Then I'd simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a different IP.  As 
long as no one can establish my connection to the web sites my spam is 
directing people to, I'm home free.Since I can set up spamassassin to I don't ""lose"" any email, what do I gain

Box knowing that there are at least a few hundred dollars waiting for me. And the best part, IT IS COMPLETELY LEGAL.Just read the next few paragraphs and see what you think.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET, BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say, ""No Way!"" read the following. This is the letter you've been reading about in the news lately.

The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in this program.

It can be started with VERY LITTLE investment ($25) and the income return is TREMENDOUS!!! THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY. It does not require you to come into contact with people, do any hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave your house except to get the mail. Simply follow the instructions, and you really can make this happen. This e-mail order marketing program works every time if you put in the effort to make it work.

Get what is rightfully yours. Program yourself for success and dare to think BIG. It sounds corny, but it's true. You'll never make it big if you don't have this belief system in place. MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability. It is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods. This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000 millionaires in the U.S., 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the last several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show 45people become millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing. You may have heard this story before, but Donald Trump made an appearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch. Without hesitating Trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work. The audience, started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response. ""That's why I'm sitting up here and you are all sitting out there!"" With network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business. Residual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing time and money once, and getting paid again and again and again. In network marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of others. The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I reread everything and gave some thought and study to it.My name is Jonathan Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I worked at for the past twelve years down- sized and my position was eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided to open my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many unforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, friends and creditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my business and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!! In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's prior to receiving this program, I had been sending away for information on various business opportunities. All of the programs I received, in my opinion were not cost effective. They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one year. It didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it! But like I was saying, in December I received this program. I didn't send for it, or ask for it; they just got my name off a mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!! After reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes. Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON. I could invest as much as I wanted to start without putting me further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and figured it out, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you I was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161 24 hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I decided ""WHY NOT."" Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my time on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need any money for printing to send out the program, and because all of my orders are filled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am telling you like it is. I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I promised myself that I would not 'rip-off"" anyone, no matter how much money it cost me. Here is the basic version of what you need to do: Your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks of your first program going out. IF YOU DON'T, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. Your second goal is to receive at least 150+ orders for Report #2 within 4 weeks. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. Once you have your 150 orders, relax, you've met your goal. You will make $50,000+ but keep at it! If you don't get 150 right off, keep at it! It may take some time for your down line to build. Keep at it, stay focused, and do not let yourself get distracted. In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1. I kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by January 13, 1 had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. My first step in making $50,000 in 90 days was done. By January 30, 1 had received 196 orders for REPORT #2; 46 more than I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. By March 1, of my e-mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000 with more coming in every day. I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car. Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER!! Remember, it won't work if you don't try it. This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place. It won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money! In order for this program to work very fast, try to meet your goal of 20+ orders for Report #1, and 150+ orders for Report #2 and you will make $50,000 or more in 90 days. If you don't reach the first two goals with in four weeks, relax, you will still make a ton of money, it may take a few months or so longer. But keep mailing out the programs and stay focused! That's the key. I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!! If you choose not to participate in this program, I am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you. If you choose to participate, follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security. If you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like I was, or you want to start your own business, consider this a sign. I DID! -Sincerely, Jonathan Rourke P.S. Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look like piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME!A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you should have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal, could not have been created by an amateur. Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable business for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but it wasn't working. Finally, I figured it out. It wasn't me; it was the economy. Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945. I don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate...because many of you know from first hand experience. There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before. The middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up. Those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor. As the saying goes, 'THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER."" The traditional Methods of making money will never allow you to ""move up"" or ""get rich"". Inflation will see to that. You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with ""NO RISK""and ""JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT."" You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of the people you send this to may send out 50,000 ... and your name will be on everyone of them! Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW! ""THINK ABOUT IT."" Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take a little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when YOU participate. Figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money! You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS! -Jody Jacobs, Richmond, VA HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$ This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am sure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days. Before you say ""No Way!"" please read this program carefully. This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making opportunity. Basically, this is what you do: As with all multilevel businesses, we- build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You do it privately in your own home, store, or office. This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere: This is what you MUST do. 1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below (You can't sell them if you don't have them). * For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem). *MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE - IN CASE OF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS! * When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five reports. You need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. * Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. 2. IMPORTANT- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps ""a"" through 'g"" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works you'll also see how it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work. a. Look below for the listing of available reports. b. After you've ordered the. five reports, take this Advertisement and remove the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000! c. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5. d. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4. e. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3 f. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2. g. Insert your name and address in the REPORT #1 position. Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! Copy and paste method works well,.3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the Instruction portion of this letter. Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $25). You obviously already have an Internet Connection and e-mail is FREE! To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much, much more. Here are two primary methods of building your downline: METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5% response. Using a good list, the response could be much better. Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders for REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people respond and order REPORT #2. Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The 0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. The 0.5% response to that is I 0,000 orders for REPORT #4. That amounts to 10,000 each of $5 bills for you in CASH MONEY! Then think about level five! That's $500,000 alone!Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000+ $50,000 + $500,000 for a total of $555,550!!! REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many people will do just that and more! REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, and e-mail software. METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 1. Advertising on the Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response. Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below: 1st level-your 10 members with $5 ....... $50 2nd level-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) ....... $500 3rd level-10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)....... $5,000 4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10k) ....... $50,000 5th level-10 members from those 10,000 ($5 x 100k) ....... $500,000THIS TOTALS - $555,550 Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of participants. THINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report! AVAILABLE REPORTS *** Order Each REPORT by NUMBER, AND NAME *** * ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) FOR EACH REPORT. CHECKS NOT ACCEPTED * - ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL - Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper (SO THAT THE BILL CAN'T BE SEEN AGAINST LIGHT) On one of those sheets of paper include: (a) the number & name of the report you are ordering, (b) your e-mail address, and (c) your name & postal address (in case your e-mail provider encounters problems). PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW: REPORT #1 ""The Insiders Guide to Advertizing for Free on the Internet"" ORDER REPORT #1 FROM: Randy Dillard P.O. Box 8 Osprey, FL 34229 USA REPORT #2 ""The Insiders Guide to Sending Bulk Email on the Internet"" ORDER REPORT #2 FROM: Carla Brown P.O. Box 39093 Sarasota, FL 34238 USA REPORT #3 ""The Secrets to Multilevel Marketing on the Internet"" ORDER REPORT #3 FROM: Glynn Schmidt P.O. Box 19424 Sarasota, FL 34276 USA REPORT #4 'How to become a Millionaire utilizing the Power of Multilevel Marketing and the Internet"" ORDER REPORT #4 FROM: Christin Joy CPO 2398 501 E. College Avenue Wheaton, IL 60187 USA REPORT #5 ""How to Send One Million E-Mails for Free.""ORDER REPORT #5 FROM: Cheri Gerhart 81719 Lido Avenue Indio, CA 92201 USA About 50,000 new people get online every month! ******* TIPS FOR SUCCESS ******* * TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow the directions accurately. * Send for the five reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when the orders start coming in. When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested product/report. * ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE. * Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the instructions exactly, your results WILL BE SUCCESSFUL! * ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED! ******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES ******* Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: Start posting ads as soon as you mail off for the reports! By the time you start receiving orders, your reports will be in your mailbox! For now, something simple, such as posting on message boards something to the effect of ""Would you like to know how to earn $50,000 working out of your house with NO initial investment? Email me with the keywords ""more info"" to find out how. And, when they email you, send them this report in response! If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT#2. If you don't, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the whole process again! There is no limit to the income you will generate from this business! Before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate in this program, answer one question ... DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE? If the answer is yes, please look at the following facts about this program: 1. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST ANYTHING TO PRODUCE! 2. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST ANYTHING TO SHIP! 3. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST YOU ANYTHING TO ADVERTISE! 4. YOU ARE UTILIZING THE POWER OF THE INTERNET AND THE POWER OF MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR PRODUCT ALL OVER THE WORLD! 5. YOUR ONLY EXPENSES OTHER THAN YOUR INITIAL $25 INVESTMENT IS YOUR TIME! 6. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE INCOME YOU GENERATE FROM THIS PROGRAM IS PURE PROFIT! 7. THIS PROGRAM WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER. ******* TESTIMONIALS******* This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income. I'm living proof that it works. It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you. If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security. -Steven Bardfield, Portland, OR My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ""junk mail."" I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a believer now. I have joined Jody in her ""hobby. "" I did have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the 'rat race,' and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM. -Mitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL. The. main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached several times before 1 checked this out. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in. -Charles Morris, Esq. Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium- size post office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return. -Paige Willis, Des Moines, IA I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program ... 11 months passed then it came ... I didn't delete this one! ... I made. more than $41,000 on the first try!! -Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PA This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck and happy spending! -Kerry Ford, Centerport, NY IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!

> Is the use of ""trusted hardware"" really worth it ?Answering that requires fairly complete knowledge of the business
model. But, in all probability: no, it isn't usually worth it. So, it
comes down to how difficult you want to make the cracker's job.If the product requires occasional authentication, simple copying
won't work; the product has to be cracked. In which case, the issue is
whether you're actually going to enter into battle with the crackers,
or just make sure that it isn't trivial.A lot of it comes down to your customer base. Teenage kids tend to be
more concerned about cost and less concerned about viruses/trojans,
and so more willing to use warez. Fortune-500 corporations are likely
to view matters differently.> Does it really make it more secure ?Yes; software techniques will only get you so far. Actually, the same
is ultimately true for hardware, but cracking hardware is likely to
require resources other than just labour.Almost (?) anything can be reverse engineered. But it may be possible
to ensure that doing so is uneconomical.> Look at the DVDs.IIRC, CSS was cracked by reverse-engineering a software player; and
one where the developers forgot to encrypt the decryption key at that.--

"http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/americas/08/26/peru.mother.reut/index.htmlLIMA, Peru (Reuters) -- Lina Medina's parents thought their 5-year-old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in Peru's Andes could find no cure, her father carried her to hospital. Just over a month later, she gave birth to a boy. Aged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. At the time, Peru's government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as ""Little Chicago."" Now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. But a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. ""The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care,"" Jose Sandoval, author of ""Mother Aged 5,"" told Reuters. ""We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That's my fundamental objective,"" he added. 'Totally willing to help'
Sandoval has raised Medina's case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. ""We're totally willing to help her,"" said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. Medina's husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. ""She got no help (in 1939) that I know about,"" he said. ""She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true."" Jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters' request for an interview. Medical rarity
No one has ever established who was the father of Medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. One of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru's poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. He said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. Her swelling stomach worried her parents. ""They thought it was a tumor,"" he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. There came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. Her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. Sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. More offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother's Day. One offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. But within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in ""moral danger,"" and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. But Sandoval said: ""It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them."" Happy ending?
Though physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. Medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. After taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. He died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. Medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. She appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. ""We just want to get on with our lives, that's it,"" said Jurado, adding he thought ""absolutely nothing"" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. He said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. He said its value was ""more or less $25,000"" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. ""If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property,"" he said. As for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. ""I believe there will be a happy ending,"" he said. ""As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an era
of corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the
country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the
prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands
and the Republic is destroyed.""

"I've been lurking the SA lists since I installed SA on a production
machine a while back. While SA did a surprisingly accurate job on
detecting English language spam, it did not succeed very well on German
language spam, which I keep getting increasing amounts of lately. I've
got a lousy results with out of the box scores, very few spam is acually
cought.What is the strategy with respect to foreign language spam recognition
in SA? I've seen extremely few non-english rules. Is there foreign
language rule development going on? Has anybody done work on German
spam?In any case, I've started spam/nonspam corpi consisting of only German
(and Swiss-German, respectively) messages, to be able to help with
German rules. Anybody willing to contribute to the corpus feel free to
resend/bounce German spam in a sane way to spam@roe.ch . I cannot be
bothered to subscribe to SAsightings just for the odd German spam every
hundred++ messages.. how about a list for foreign language spam
sightings?Has anybody done this before or am I on the edge of duplicating effort
here?I've been thinking on this a bit. I think it would be best if there
would be general provisions for foreign language rules. In the spirit of
the ok_languages option; let users easily enable or disable rules in
certain languages. Like a foreign_rules option which could be used to
control which foreign rulesets are active. Usually people would want to
use checks in all languages which are in the ok_languages list.Is there any development or are there plans along those lines? Are there
other people willing to contribute to effective spam filtering rules in
German language?Any kind of feedback is welcome, even flames ;)Cheers,

"stylistics joanna thornborrow and shan wareing , patterns in language an introduction to language and literary style patterns in language addresses the real needs of students who may not have an extensive background either in traditional literature or in linguistic theory . this student-friendly textbook uses the principles of linguistic analysis to investigate the aesthetic use of language in literary ( and non-literary ) texts . written in straightforward , accessible language with imaginative examples and a humorous tone , it shows how linguistic knowledge can enhance and enrich the analysis of texts . the authors borrow from traditional stylistics , but focus primarily on the recurring linguistic patterns which are used by writers of poetry , fiction and drama . the authors draw on a wide variety of textual sources to illustrate their observations , making reference to both canonical literature and modern literary texts , as well as to popular fiction , television and the language of advertising . exercises designed to develop the students ' understanding of the material are provided at every stage , and sample answers are also included . interface routledge : 1998 : 280 pp cl : 0 415 14063 3 : # d5081 : $ 65 . 00 pb : 0 415 14064 1 : # d5085 : $ 20 . 99 jonathan culpepper , peter verdonk , and mick short , eds . , exploring the language of drama from text to context focusing on the characterization of speech as a form of action , exploring the language of drama introduces students to the stylistic analysis of drama . here , some of the world 's leading scholars demonstrate the importance of analyzing the text of drama rather than focusing on performance , presenting their approaches in an engaging and accessible style . the essays employ techniques from language analysis ( specifically discourse analysis , cognitive linguistics and pragmatic ) to explore the language of plays , looking at how different theories and approaches can be used to help us understand characterization in dialogue , the cognitive patterns that support the narrative and discourse of drama , and the basic mechanisms of conversation in dramatic dialogue . each chapter ends in a summary with follow-up exercises , and offers practical advice on how to analyze a play extract and write it up as an assignment . interface routledge : 1998 : 192 pp cl : 0 415 13794 2 : # d5353 : $ 65 . 00 pb : 0 415 13795 0 : # d5357 : $ 20 . 99",Safe Email

                        Marketing since its inception. E-marketing provides individuals 
                        and businesses with a low cost solution for broad-based 
                        advertising                        If you are new to this concept do not fret! I was too! 
                        It took me over 2 years of research by scowering the Internet, 
                        dealing with false claims, hassling with the (so-called) 
                        ""bulk-mail specialists"" experiencing the trials 
                        and errors ""bogus"" software programs and false 
                        claims they make, to truly understand the ins & outs 
                        of marketing concepts and principles of email marketing.These 
                          processes are time consuming, resource intensive, frustrating 
                          and potentially expensive for individuals and companies 
                          to do on their own.
Let's 
                          face it! Most people in business want to make money! 
                          Their time is consumed by running their business, developing 
                          marketing campaigns and advertisement, cashing checks, 
                          dealing with customers, managing their staff and so 
                          on!
They 
                          don't have time to invest in learning 10 or 15 different 
                          software applications, learn how to effectively port 
                          scan for IPS, Socks and SMTP relays, spend thousands 
                          of dollars for ""The Best"" software applications, 
                          spend hours testing applications for the best results 
                          or for that matter, spending 2 or more years to learn 
                          what someone else has already mastered!
If 
                          you are interested in increasing your effectiveness 
                          with email marketing, increasing your client base, maximizing

Matched with a simple spam reporting scheme, this could keep the
training up to date with little effort.  I've sketched out an approach
a listserver like Mailman could do along these lines and if I get some
free time I'll hack something together.I like the idea of a POP proxy which is classifying messages as
they're pulled from the server.  The easiest way for such a beast to
be notified of spam might be to simply save the spam in a special
folder or file that the POP proxy would periodically consult.-Barry

about xine that I apparently unintentionally compiled with ALSA directly
:-/I'd like to aks this on the rpm-zzzlist : Would a new dependency of 250k, the
alsa-lib package, for many packages (mplayer, ogle, xine) be a problem for
the freshrpms.net packages users? As I really feel like blending ALSA in

In my experience, this is classic ""American"" behaviour, and I don't 
think its on the increase outside of the US of A.

trying to speak (in the vernacular, 'getting in their face') is rude and
disrespectful.  And persistently getting in someones face is assault, a
criminal offense. If these people have something to say, they can say it
with signs or get their own venue.  And here is something else to chew on...
these protesters are NOT interested in changing anyones mind about what
Rumsfield is saying. How likely are you to change someone's mind by being
rude and disrespectful to them? Is this how to win friends and influence
people? Either these folks are social misfits who have no understanding of
human interactions (else they would try more constructive means to get their
message across) or they are just out to get their rocks off regardless of
how it affects other people, and that is immoral at best and downright evil
at worst.Bill

) - most likely reviews completed on functions that assessed as concerns across multiple business - such as fx exposure management , cash management , credit exposure management , it change management controls / process where are we now - if we all thought to do this immediately we do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses - i am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the houston offsite do this ?

Selling Travel in Today's EconomyGood morning!
  Â 
Since it may have been awhile since you visited us
atÂ www.mailpound.comÂ I
  wanted to update you on what is happening. When we launched the MailPound
  almost two years ago, our focus was on saving ""Time, Toner and
  Trees""Â by providing an alternative forÂ organizing the huge
  number of faxes suppliers sent travel agents each week. Our most popular
  feature was the FAM section, followed by the Weekly Sweepstakes.
  Â 
But that has changed.
  Â 
Like many involved in selling retail travel, we have been
  striving to find ways to succeed in a challenging environment. Additional
  commission cuts, the aftermath of 9/11, and the drop in the stock
market, has
  had a cumulative effect on all of us. To survive, to succeed, we know
that we
  will need to work harder, work smarter, and work together. We have
gotten a
  tremendous amount of support from travel agents and this has translated
into
  the ability to get more support for travel agents from suppliers.
  Â 
Our focus has expanded from providing a resource for
searching supplier
  Special Offers to providing a suite of tools and services that can create
  sales and raise commissions. Almost all of these services are supplier
  supported and FREE to travel agents.
Actively seek out the bestÂ e-commerce
values
HelpÂ you market Special Offers to your
clients
Host personal web sites for travel agents with
MailPound
    content*
OfferÂ higher commissions through
consolidation
Organize sales incentives from suppliers
Provide new technology for fast and easyÂ online
    bookings
Provide your clients with the ability to book through
you,
    online
*Â MPdirect services are offered for
$9.95/month
  Â 
We invite you to visit us soon at www.mailpound.comÂ or
  check out the links shown below. See how the FREE services we offer the
travel
  agent community can help you succeed. The Summer is almost over, now is
the
  time to prepare for the upcoming selling season.

skin cancer on my right leg about the size of a dime. It had grown very fast and 
was infected. With daily use of Chickweed Healing Salve the whole 
thing disappeared with 2 weeks without leaving a scar. - Sheila Holbrook,  
 Testimonial: My newly born baby, now one month 
old, had chronic diaper rash. Several doctors had tried to get it to go 
away...nothing seemed to work, she continued to be raw and sore. She cried all 
the time. I tried your Chickweed Healing Salve, putting it on that night. 
By the next morning she was much better. After using it for 2 days, she was 
completely cured. She is now a beautiful baby. She doesn't cry anymore. I paid 
$19.95 for it, however I would gladly have paid $100. Thanks so much. I will 
always keep it on hand. I will gladly give your product a good reference if 
anyone wants to give me a call. Shellie Cooper Stanly, KS 
Testimonial: I had these dark spots on my leg for 15 years. I'm 
not sure what it was but it was growing! After two months of using the 
Chickweed Healing Salve the spots are almost gone. I also use it 
for dry skin on my heels and toes. Its amazing stuff! Kirk B. Testimonial: I 
had a rash under my arm for 9 months. I tried a lot of salves and lotions but 
nothing worked until I tried Chickweed Healing Salve . I applied 
it 2 times a day and it went away within one month. I also had some spots on my 
face. Within 3 and 1/2 weeks they were all gone. Steve Burington

"Jets Attempt to Intercept 'Contrail' By ROBERT BURNS
AP Military Writer WASHINGTON (AP)--The military command responsible for the defense of North
American airspace scrambled fighter jets in response to unverified reports
of an airborne condensation trail, or contrail, moving from the Caribbean to
the United States, defense officials said Thursday. Lt. Col. Michael Humm, a Pentagon spokesman, said the incident happened
Wednesday and that the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado
Springs, Colo., was continuing to investigate. The reported contrail stirred concern because of the possibility that it
could have indicated the presence of an unauthorized jet aircraft in or
approaching American airspace. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, the
Pentagon has taken greater precautions to monitor U.S. airspace. A contrail is created by vapor from a jet engine in the presence of cold
air. The jets that were scrambled to attempt to intercept and identify the source
of the contrail found nothing, said Lt. Cmdr. Curtis Jenkins, a NORAD
spokesman. He said NORAD had developed no new information since the initial
report at 4 p.m. EST on Wednesday. NORAD is reviewing data from its tracking
radars in search of evidence, he said. A Pentagon statement said NORAD received unverified reports of ``what
appeared to be a contrail of unknown origin,'' originally in the vicinity of
the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. ``Initially, it was reported to be heading northwestward toward the United
States,'' the statement said. ``Commercial airline pilots later reported the
contrail over Florida and later over Indiana. Thereafter, no other sightings
were reported.'' The reported contrail was never verified by visual or radar contact, the
Pentagon statement said. At the Federal Aviation Administration, spokesman Paul Turk said, ``I'm
aware of the reports.'' He referred all questions to NORAD. Jenkins said he was not sure who reported the initial sighting over the
Caribbean. He also was unsure who requested NORAD to launch fighter jets or
from which military bases they were scrambled. ``We don't necessarily judge or second-guess when a request comes to us to
investigate'' a contrail, he said. Meanwhile, reports of a ball of fire streaking across the sky early Thursday
had people throughout the Northwest flooding radio and television stations
with calls reporting a meteor shower. It was believed that the light came from a Russian rocket body re-entering
the Earth's atmosphere about 6:15 a.m. The U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha,
Neb., and the North American Aerospace Defense Command confirmed a Russian
rocket fell back to Earth, but gave no further details.

process for passing a message through might require the assertion
of a legally-enforceable guarantee about the messages' contents.
Passing certain tests once might add an address to the persistent
whitelist.Any slightly determined and legitimate correspondent would be
able to find multiple ways to get their mail read, while spammers
would face a situation where the marginal cost of reaching me
is much, much greater than the expected return. Some economically irrational spammers (and religious/political 
zealots) would get through, but such traffic should be a 
background trickle rather than an annoying torrent.- Gordon

( see the "" how we do it "" techniques described below ) . each file contains exactly 100 , 000 email addresses . there are only aol & mixed addresses on this cd . aol : you get over 50 files of 100 , 000 each of aol which equals over 5 , 000 , 000 addresses . the aol addresses are verified 100 % deliverable at time of production and were collected throughout the production schedule-then reverified as deliverable . all of the following domains have been removed from vol . 4 . absolutely not included : compuserve . com genie . com delphi . com gnn . com ( dropped by aol and not active at this time ) , edu , . gov , . mil , . org , and no state domains ending in . us no international domains used on this cd . only pure . com & . net ! ! ! no "" duplicate "" addresses . all "" dupes "" were filtered out . here ' s how we get the cleanest email addresses available anywhere ! ! 1 . 190 + million lines of email addresses were filtered and duplicates eliminated . this process , alone , reduces the list into a manageable number . 2 . another filter list of 400 + words / phrases were used to reduce the lists even more . no addresses with profane or inappropriate wording survived . 3 . a special filter file was used to eliminate most of the "" web poisoned "" email addresses from these lists . most of the lists we purged were full of bogus addresses . one list , in particular , had over 90 % poison in it . our exclusive system reduced these types of addresses to zero . 4 . a "" daily updated "" anti bulk email list of terrorists and general anti-internet advertising extremists was used to rid our lists of those people who , in a cowardly and deliberate manner , attack all marketing people who choose to utilize the greatest marketing discovery of all time - direct email . our database of these individuals is the largest one maintained worldwide and it keeps our lists of undesirable and extremist elements . 5 . in addition to the above , we also maintain a database that we update every day . this database contains undeliverable addresses , and addresses of those who have asked to be removed from any and all mailing lists ( this is comparable to the opt-out kind of list maintained by the dma , etc ) . owning this cd . . . is equivalent to you having to buy all lists and other cds of our competitors , plus the huge amount of resources our team secures through private means . the major difference is . . . . ours is thoroughly cleaned & free of all the "" filled "" & "" bogus "" addresses used by our competition to add inflated numbers to their lists . we perform hundreds of hours of production and thousands of dollars in order to offer you the cleanest and purest cd of quality addresses found anywhere worldwide ! sending your marketing letter to any one of our 100 lists of 100 , 000 ( 10 million in all ) is equivalent to sending 1 , 000 , 000 / one million of our competitors addresses to equal the same response , sales ratio , etc . would n't you rather send just 100 , 000 instead of 1 , 000 , 000 letters ? just think what results you would get if you sent 1 , 000 , 000 using our quality lists ! with our lists you will send less and get more results . our list will result in : higher response ratios higher sales ratios more receptive prospects ; less flames & non-buyers less contact with anti-commerce radicals who want the net for themselves ! you ' ll get 100 of the cleanest email files available anywhere ! each of our new volumes improves in quality and content . no competitor even comes close to matching this superior product . you must use it and compare for yourself ! this product will prove to be the best of it 's kind compared to any cd in terms of hours and money spent bringing it to market . no competitor will ever duplicate the effort of what it takes for us to produce this final product . we don t compromise quality , and we surely won't release any product before it passes our "" high standards "" test for quality .
