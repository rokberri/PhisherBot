server. It doesn't keep in your mail. You don't request your mail there. 
Nor do most people check for spam only when they are going to read their 
mail. My setup check a mail against Razor when my server receives it, 
not when I'm going to read it. If you wait to get 1000 reply for a mail, 
it means you have to wait for 1000 people to read it (at least, some 
people may not vote because they don't want to vote that day or because 
they don't think it's spam). Knowing that about half the planet would be 
sleeping (night time) and thus not reading their mail, it would mean 
that at least 2000 people already received the mail in their inbox. 
Knowing that, among the people who are not sleeping, not all of them are 
constantly reading their mail. I would say that less than 1 people over 
10 read their mail as soon as it arrives. That means that 20,000 people 
already recieved the mail and checked it against the Razor database 
before you would get your 1000 votes.Also, with your system, 99% is the best you could get. If you wait for 
only one vote, maybe only 20 guy would read the mail (1 to vote, 10 
sleeping, and 9 not reading their mail soon enough). Wich gives a value 
99.98%. That's far better than your 99% don't you think.
In RealLife(tm), most likely one guy voting won't be enough but the 
thing is that it will stop the spam as early as possible.Also, if for some reason, this mail is one of those people don't agree 
on whether it is spam or not, it would take a while to revoke those 1000 
reports, which means that some people may lose this legitimate (to them) 
mail.You mentioned that with this system, people will re-report less often. 
First, I don't see how waiting *longer* before making a decision on the 
legitimacy of a mail will reduce re-reporting. The more you wait, the 
more people will get the mail in their inbox, the more people will see 
the mail (again, not everybody check their mail against Razor at read 
time, most do it a reception time using procmail/spamassassin). Second, 
re-reporting has its use, it increase the confidence that a mail is spam.So I don't see what you gain with your 1000 people.	Jehan-------------------------------------------------------

"enron sells hpl and bammel american electric power buys houston pipe line american electric power thursday announced it has made a major move to expand its wholesale natural gas business in the southwest , agreeing to acquire the 2 . 4 bcf / d houston pipe line ( hpl ) along with the bammel storage field , one of the largest storage fields in north america , from enron . aep said since some details remain to be worked out , it was not disclosing the terms of the transaction at this time . aep will be acquiring the stock of hpl and it expects to complete the deal in the next couple months . hpl , one of the two original pipelines joined by enron chairman ken lay to form the company in the mid - 1980 s , has an extensive 4 , 400 mile transportation and gathering system through southern texas . the 118 bcf bammel field , located near the houston ship channel market area , has a 65 . 7 bcf working gas capacity and is known for its fast in and out capabilities . it has a 1 . 4 bcf / d peak withdrawal rate and a 365 mmcf / d injection capacity . "" adding hpl to our natural gas asset portfolio will help us reach our goal of becoming a top - 10 gas trader and marketer , "" said paul addis , executive vice president for aep . the company currently is second in the u . s . in electricity volume . "" hpl will enhance aep ' s natural gas business with its multiple connections into the production areas of texas , its numerous interconnects with intrastate and interstate pipelines and its position in and around houston as a premier provider of natural gas . "" aep , headquartered in columbus , oh , has numerous power generation plants in the midwest and southwest , including a number of gas - fired plants in texas . in 1998 it bought the louisiana intrastate gas ( lig ) system . john olson , energy analyst with sanders , morris & mundy in houston , said "" for 55 years hpl has enjoyed a reputation as one of the strongest pipelines in the country . as a stand - alone operation it is first class . it ' s a very , very strong asset . "" he said hpl has been showing losses of $ 50 million a year or more in recent years , "" but those numbers are meaningless "" because enron has been using it at discounted transportation rates to underpin its marketing efforts . olson said the sale is a continuation of enron ' s move to sell most of its hard assets and become a soft asset player . "" they are emphasizing their trading . they are doing far better at trading . "" for one houston - based risk manager , the sale of hpl by enron was a question of rate of return . the competition among intrastates in texas is fiercely competitive and for gas delivered to the houston ship channel it can be a game of half - cents , with a shipper on one of the multiple intrastates undercutting another to try to shave a profit , he said . enron recognized this and wanted out , he speculated . - -",Safe Email

"who doesn't appreciate both PLUCK and LUCK is only looking at part of the equation.America has, in fact, moved hard toward Meritocracy. But -- and this is a huge one -- you don't necessarily find it on the Forbes list. There is an element of LUCK, even if only being in the right place at the right time, to go that high.Beyond the Forbes List, there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK is involved in significant wealth. Being a super-model, for example. Though I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models. Cindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school.Most people, of course, aren't in those stratified realms. It is the rest of us who tend to sort.There is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in the first place. Rawls claims Merit doesn't exist. Sowell seems to agree at least in part, but I'm sure Sowell would also state that the benefits of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous.And if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring? IQ? Purity of heart? Or the ability to satisfy customers? Functionally most people seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be better if it were purity of heart. Yet the type of Merit that lands you on the Forbes list, or even just being a garden variety 'millionaire next door' is more likely to be the 'serving customers' definition.Differences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far more animosity than differences due to luck. Luck can be forgiven.

Also, you could try ""alsactl store"", editing /etc/asound.state"" by hand

then run ""alsactl restore"" and see if you're able to change what you want

The primary desert warfare facilities and schools ARE in the Southwest,
most notably Fort Irwin deep in the Mojave/Anza Borrego (the
headquarters and core training facilities for all things desert warfare
related), and have been for a long time. There are two reasons that
immediately come to mind as to why they do not use the Fort Irwin,
Edwards AFB, and other expanses of desert that they have traditionally
used for desert warfare training and exercises.  The first is logistical: Virtually all the mechanized infantry units are
located east of the Rockies, and it must be very expensive to move
entire heavy combat divisions a couple thousand miles every time they
want to run training exercises.  This is particularly true since so much
of our military is made up of reserve components these days, meaning
that you can't move the soldiers to where the training facilities are.The second is environmental lawsuits and pending judicial action and
injunctions. The desert training facilities in the Southwest deserts
have been aggressively assaulted by environmental organizations who are
making the case that heavy mechanized units zipping back and forth
across the deep desert endanger the desert tortoise and a bunch of other
theoretically endangered species that are concentrated in the southwest
deserts. The ability of the military to use the desert facilities has
been significantly impeded these days while all the lawsuits and whatnot
with the various environmental groups are being sorted out.-James Rogers

"Hobos in the depression used to use this technique to
know if they could find a meal or a bed and how
friendly the residents were to begging.  This showed
up on sladhdot in June.  It'll be interesting to see
what the parallel sign is for the Hobo sign
that representing a meal or bed if threatened. Can
you imagine threatening someone to get your wireless? Another phenomenon is Internet connection sharing which is
freely available on most modern OSs.  It's a very easy way to

  FBI warns about wireless craze
  Some FBI agents are worried about warchalking  Well-meaning wireless activists have caught the attention of the US Federal Bureau
  of Investigation. 
  One of its agents has issued a warning about the popular practice of using chalk marks
  to show the location of wireless networks.   The marks, or ""warchalks"", are cropping up in cities and suburbs across the world.   The FBI is now telling companies that, if they see the chalk marks outside their
  offices, they should check the security of wireless networks and ensure they remain
  closed to outsiders.   Top marks   The warchalking phenomena is only a couple of months old but it has generated a huge
  amount of interest.   The idea behind warchalking is to use a standardised set of symbols to mark the
  existence of wireless networks that anyone can use to go online.   Many community groups and local governments, and even some public-spirited
  companies, are setting up wireless nodes that give people fast net access. 
  This symbol denotes a closed wireless node   The wireless networks replace computer cables with radio and are usually very easy to
  set up and connect to.   Before now many curious hackers have gone on ""wardriving"" expeditions which
  involve them driving around an area logging the location of the wireless networks.   Many companies using wireless do not do enough to make them secure and stop people
  outside the organisation using them.   So the FBI is issuing advice to companies to be on the lookout for warchalk marks as a
  pointer to the security of their wireless network.   ""If you notice these symbols at your place of business, it is likely your network has
  been identified publicly,"" warns the guidance from the FBI.   Scare stories?   The agent who circulated the warning in Pittsburgh said it was not an official FBI
  advisory or policy but was information worth passing on.   He urged anyone using a wireless network to ensure that it was secure and used only by
  those a company wants to access it.   Warchalkers have questioned the scare stories surrounding the phenomena, saying that
  anyone with malicious intent is unlikely to publicly mark their target.   The phrases ""wardriving"" and ""warchalking"" derive from the early days of computer
  hacking when curious users programmed their computers to search for all phone lines
  that returned data tones. The exhaustive searching was known as ""wardialling"".

The quote is not suggesting that people use './configure'. 2. The quote is not saying that rpm will _try_ to eval macros even if the user forgot to pass the leading '%'. It is saying the opposite: rpm will try to support users who ""forgot"" to _leave off_ the leading '%'. That is what the documentation _says_, but rpm does not follow the documentation. If you leave off the '%', then rpm will not eval the macro, at least for rpm 4.0.4.Confused?Anyway, back to my original problem: what about documentation for the macros '%post', '%postun', and '%files'? Here's some of what I found ""documented"" in the the CHANGES file that 'rpm' includes:Line 46: - macro for %files, always include %defattr(), redhat config only.Line 49: - bail on %files macro.Hmm. So, there is no %files macro?Line 172-174: - add ""rpmlib(ScriptletInterpreterArgs)"" to track %post -p ""/sbin/ldconfig -n /usr/lib"" incompatibilities.I'm unable to find a corresponding description for %postun, but it appears to work just the same. The important things to remember are: 1. Don't forget the double-quotes around the -p argument string. If you leave them off, you'll get the cryptic error message: error: line #: Package does not exist: %post -p /sbin/ldconfig -n /usr/lib 2.

"re : 6 . 199 ipa it would be nice to have true democracy when trying to reach agreement on how to use phonetic symbols , as stemburger has suggested . just as war is too important a matter to be left to the generals , so choosing a standardized set of symbols should n't be left to the phoneticians . the international phonetic association has always recognized this . it is fully conscious of the fact that ipa symbols are used by a wide variety of people . at the 1989 kiel convention , which was the first major revision for almost 50 years , there was a great deal of discussion about remembering our ' customers ' , as one phonetician put it . and ( despite comments to the contrary by participants in this discussion ) the only changes since then have been small changes that affect comparatively few users of the alphabet , largely because of the belief that it is important for the alphabet to remain as stable as possible . if stemburger would like to organize some kind of referendum , good luck to him . i note that he suggests the lsa as the appropriate body for the u . s . , although he also mentions ashla ( american speech hearing and language association ) as an interested group that has officially adopted the ipa . their membership is much larger than the lsa . the asa ( acoustical society of america ) is another group that has many members interested in phonetic symbols . the1989 ipa kiel convention was open to all , and did include members of all the organizations mentioned by stemburger , including lsa , ashla , asa , sil and others , none of the participants , of course , speaking officially for any of these organizations . the convention was also publicized in a paper in language , the only paper that morris halle and i have ever co-authored . i really do not see how we can get more international collaboration . agreeing on symbols is as difficult as getting everyone to use the same units for measuring weights and distances . in response to my previous suggestion that people interested in choices of phonetic symbols should join the international phonetic association , i have received inquiries as to how to do this . there is a form in the journal of the international phonetic association ( which members receive - - and your university library + should + take ) . but really all you need to do is to send your name and address , plus a check for $ 25 or # 13 sterling ( or request to charge access / mastercharge / visa / eurocard ) for the annual dues to : secretariat , ipa linguistics and phonetics univeristy of leeds leeds , ls2 9jt , u . k . peter ladefoged",Safe Email

"review of arboreal for windows review of : arboreal for windows , cascadilla press . by dr . matthew crocker ( mwc @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk ) centre for cognitive science , university of edinburgh . arboreal for windows ( henceforth , arborwin ) is a package designed to facilitate drawing trees within microsoft ( tm ) windows ( tm ) applications . arborwin consists simply of a truetype ( tm ) font in which keys are mapped to tree component shaped characters rather than standard keyboard symbols . the advantage of drawing trees in this way is that arborwin is very portable , and can be used in any wysiwyg windows ( tm ) application which allows you to select specific fonts ( i . e . most ) . the disadvantage , broadly , is that ` type-setting ' or layout of the trees is left to the user . the ` characters ' of arborwin include left , right , vertical , and ` triangle ' branches - - each of several widths ( but all the same height ) . the font is also fully scalable . in general , i found that arborwin behaved as intended , given that it is simply a font-based package . its most basic limitation is that there is a relatively small selection of branch sizes ( i . e . how narrow or wide a branch is ) . in practice , the most common problem i encountered was that ` triangle ' branches ( eg , for phrase without internal structure ) could n't be made wide enough . . . given that one often wants to put fairly long phrases under these . the only way to increase the width was to increase the point size for the branch ; but this also increases the height of the particular branch , and makes trees look disproportionate and inconsistent . being font-based , however , also means it cannot attain the flexibility of alternative packages ( eg , the ` tree ' package for latex ) . the ' tree ' package , for example , takes as input a declarative tree specification ( as a bracketed list ) and then automatically typesets the tree , and also permits crossing branches , and upside-down trees . since typesetting is automatic , the tree formatting is consistent , and tailored to the size / length of terminals ( including the triangle branches ) . overall the package is simple to use and quite effective if your requirements ( in terms of both sophistication , and layout quality ) are not too demanding . if greater flexibility , consistency , and quality is required , then i believe there is still no substitute for latex and its associated packages . dr . matthew crocker , esrc research fellow centre for cognitive science university of edinburgh mwc @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk",Safe Email

' ss12 ' will be held at the institute of education university of london 20 bedford way london wc1h oal uk from thursday 26th march ( mid-day ) to saturday 28th march ( mid-day ) 1998 programme plenaries colloquia papers in parallel sessions short ' work in progress ' reports poster presentations publishers displays social events british sign language interpretation available to participants who request this in advance . academic organising committee professor jenny cheshire , queen mary & westfield college , university of london ; professor jennifer coates , roehampton institute london ; dr penelope gardner - chloros , birkbeck college , university of london ; dr ben rampton & celia roberts , thames valley university ; euan reid , institute of education , university of london . ; professor brian street , king 's college , university of london . plenaries professor jan blommaert ( university of antwerp / international pragmatics association ) : reconstructing the sociolinguistic image of africa : grassroots writing in shaba , congo . professor debbie cameron ( university of strathclyde , glasgow ) , good to talk ? the discourse and practice of communication skills . professor penny eckert ( stanford university ) variation , style & identity . professor susan gal ( university of chicago ) language ideologies and linguistic boundaries : the semiotics of differentiation . colloquia 1 . speech representation & institutional discourse convenors : stef slembrouck , dept of english , university of gent , belgium & mike baynham , centre for language & literacy , university of technology , sydney this colloquium aims to bring together concerns with institutional discourse and an interest in discourse representation phenomena ( ' reported speech ' ) . its focus will be on how institutional members ( clients , professionals and novices ) represent , incorporate and appropriate the discourses ( ' voices ' ) of ' the other ' in their own discourse . this theme is intended to reflect the growing body of research into practices of discourse representation in a range of sites ( media , legal , educational , social work ) . in these sites , such practices are often constitutive of institutional processes and affect institutional outcomes . the colloquium theme also ties in with the current interest ( within pragmatics , discourse analysis , etc . ) in re-contextualisation and processes of ( re ) formulation . contributors include : malcolm coulthard , janet maybin , geert jacobs , titus ensink , greg myers , graham hall , srikant sarangi & akira satoh , 2 . constructing the university : problematizing the notion of language in academic discourse . convenors : carys jones & brian street , school of education , king 's college , university of london the aim of this colloquium is to explore issues surrounding academic literacies and the genre of faculty feedback , with particular reference to british and international students in higher education . rather than focus on study skills or academic socialisation , the dominant discourses in this field , the session will address from a number of perspectives the model of academic literacies and discourses , which problematise the varied literacy practices involved in the constitution of ' the university ' . in particular the focus will be on the gap between student and faculty expectations of academic writing processes and the conceptualisation and representation of ' language ' embedded in them . contributors will include , in addition to the convenors , fiona english , monika hermerschmidt , mary lea , mary scott , joan turner & theresa lillis . 3 . language , gender & sexuality convenor : debbie cameron ( university of strathclyde ) this colloquium is a response to the rapid development of sociolinguistic work in which sexuality or sexual identity is a key social variable . among the questions we hope to reflect on , in papers , responses to papers and open discussion , are : is there and should there be a distinctive gay / lesbian sociolinguistics ? how should we theorise the relationship between sexuality and gender ? have sociolinguists talked too little about heterosexualities ? how do sociolinguists position themselves with regard to existing theories of sexual identity / practice , especially feminist theory and queer theory ? contributors : kathryn remlinger , paul mcilvenny , joanne winter . 4 . oral narratives across contexts & cultures convenors : alexandra georgakopoulou , dept . of byzantyne and modern greek studies , king 's college , university of london & shoshana blum - kulka , department of communication , hebrew university , jerusalem , israel . the goal of the colloquium is to bring together ethnographic , discourse analytical and interactional sociolinguistic perspectives to discuss the role of context and culture in the discursive shaping of oral narrative modes and functions . the papers presented will attempt to combine micro-level with macro-level analytic concerns , and their scope will cover a wide range of oral narrative modes ( e . g . conversational stories , life histories , mediated discourse narratives , family dinner narratives ) in different communities . papers will be presented by catherine snow , shoshana blum - kulka , alexandra georgakopoulou , esther schelly - newman and tamar katriel . the discussants of the presentations will include johanna thornborrow , maria sifianou , mike baynham and paddy scannell . 5 . disability , language & social identity convenor : graham h . turner , deaf studies group , department of education studies , university of central lancashire , preston this interdisciplinary colloquium sets out to address questions raised by claims about ' deaf identity ' - in the sense of an identity shaped by distinct linguistic and cultural forms - and other disabled identities , by focusing upon the role of language in discourse practices that construct and reflect such identities . does the language currently used by and about disabled people ( including deaf people ) sustain the distinction , and what part does language play in any changes being witnessed ? in spite of the existence of theoretical deaf and disability literature , relatively little has to date emerged by way of empirical accounts of language choices in either personal or institutional discourse , and there has been little theorization of language practices in such contexts . while sociolinguists ' discussions of ( for instance ) ethnicities move on from the debate about group-membership - as-acquired - disposition versus group-membership - as-situated - performance , there remains little exploration of even these two notions in relation to language and disability . the purpose of this colloquium is to assess the state of knowledge in this field and to begin to explore ( a ) the role of disabled people in effecting language change , ( b ) the extent to which communicative practices are defining in relation to disabled identities , ( c ) what ( if any ) patterns emerge from the cross-referencing of different groups in this regard and ( d ) what kinds of research could tell us more about the role of language in constructing and performing disability . within this session ( which will have british sign language / english interpretation ) four 25 - minute papers will be followed by short independent responses from two discussants and an open workshop session for exploration of issues arising . contributors include : jenny corbett , mairian corker , susan gregory , & kyra pollitt . 6 . computer - mediated communication , language and society convenor : dr . simeon j . yates , discipline of sociology , faculty of social sciences , open university . the colloquium will cover a range of sociolinguistic topics relating to the use of computer - mediated communication ( cmc ) in contemporary society . cmc systems range from the personal forms of electronic mail and internet-relay chat , through on-line forms of audio and video conferencing , to the world wide web and other digital media formats . the aim of the colloquium is to explore , through the discussion of presented papers , the connections between language use , cmc and key aspects of contemporary society , such as : globalisation , work , politics , identity , gender and media genres . this colloquium represents a development of the session on the socio-linguistics of computer - mediated communication ( cmc ) held at ss11 , and will provide an opportunity for researchers in this field to present and discuss current theories and findings . the focus of the session will be upon the relationship between contemporary society , contemporary language use and the various forms of cmc . speakers will include : simeon j . yates , susan herring , john paolillo , lynn cherny , lorenzo mondada , robert fouser , zazie todd , p . nayar & jacqueline johnson lambiase . . 7 . maintaining indigenous languages , with special reference to latin america - state planning vs grass - roots initiatives : convenors : jane freeland ( univ of portsmouth ) & rosaleen howard - malverde ( univ of liverpool ) latin american governments are giving increasing attention to the maintenance of indigenous langauges , mainly through formal education . however , outcomes frequently clash with , are even destructive of , language maintenance strategies developed by organised indigenous groups . this workshop will explore the relationship between these different approaches , through a series of brief case studies ( pre-circulated ) , but above all through extensive discussionof the language planning issues raised by this clash . speakers will include : kendall king , sheila aikman , serafin coronel - molina , tim marr & eliseo canulef m . 8 . language & multimodality convenor : prof . gunther kress , culture communication and societies ( ccs ) group , institute of education , london texts in many domains of public communication are becoming more intensely multimodal : that is , they make a deliberate use of the visual as well as the written ( where before that might have been an incidental matter ) for overt purposes of communication . social difference therefore finds expression not only in the linguistic mode whether written or spoken ( as in generic or discursive differences , eg ) but in other modes . different combinations , different emphases of modes may respond to different social purposes , so that even at this level there is a new issue of what the consequences are for language . if in a multimodal text some information is carried visually and some verbally - where before it was all carried verbally - it follows that language will play a different role in the overtly multi modal text than it did in the formerly ( at least ostensibly ) monomodal text . other participants : theo van leeuwen , david graddol , roz ivanic & fiona ormerod , radan martinec , carey jewitt , and judy delin . 9 . teaching & learning bilingually in post - colonial contexts convenors : marilyn martin - jones , university of lancaster & peter martin , universiti brunei darussalam . over the last decade , there has been an increasing amount of research into language practices in schools and classrooms in a number of post-colonial contexts . in each of these multililngual contexts , a former colonial language is still used as a medium of instruction . the aim of this colloquium is to bring together researchers working in different multilingual sites and to enable them to compare insights from research which combines detailed analysis of bilingual classroom discourse with ethnographic observation . our specific objectives are ( 1 ) to compare the ways in which teachers and learners in these settings accomplish lessons in two languages ; ( 2 ) to identify commonalities and differences in bilingual discourse practices observed and analysed in different institutional sites ; ( 3 ) to discuss the implications of these commonalities and differences . contributors include : casimir rubagumya , grace bunyi & nancy hornberger , angel lin & jo arthur , in addition to the convenors . 10 . language play & the construction of meaning among working class teenagers in hong kong . convenor : angel lin , city university of hong kong . other contributors will include isaac lam , michelle kwan , tit - wing lo & kevin chu , with chris candlin as discussant . 11 . there will also be a postgraduate workshop , convened by kristina bennert , of university college , cardiff . bennert @ cardiff . ac . uk . further details on programme by post : the full provisional programme is now being sent by post to people as they register , along with local travel details , and hotel booking arrangements . on the internet : our website is being updated regularly until the event itself , and you can find us at : http : / / www . ioe . ac . uk / ccs / ss12 papers as well as the colloquia , the programme includes c60 35 -

Or at least, I don't. I saw an advert for it on TV last night (can't miss Futurama :-) and I thought, ""boy, that's dumb.""

"DEAR SIR,I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian
Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on 
the 8th
of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will 
be of
great assistance to each other likewise 
developing a
cordial relationship.I currently have within my reach the sum of 
thirty
six million United States Dollars 
(US$36,000,000) in
cash, which I intend to use for investment 
purposes
specifically in your country. This money came 
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my 
late
husband and a Russian firm on our country's
Multi-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The
Russian partners returned my husbands share of
US$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with 
my
late husband's security company in Nigeria of 
which I
am a director. Right now the new civilian 
government
have intensified their probe on my husband's 
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses 
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company. 
In view
of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and 
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad.No record ever existed concerning the money 
neither is
the money traceable by the Government because 
there is
no documentation showing that we received the 
money
from the Russians.Due to the current situation in the country 
concerning
Government attitude towards my family, it has 
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this 
money
within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this 
money
into your safe bank account. On your consent, I 
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction.Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed 
to
transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 
20% of
the total sum to you for the expected services 
and
assistance. Your urgent response is highly 
needed so
as to stop further contacts. all correspondent 
should be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m@ompadec.zzn.con
or you can call my son mobile:hamza   234-8023137978 I  use this 
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most 
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while I 
await your
prompt response.Best personal regards,MRS MARIAM ABACHA.--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--

"A while ago I asked what other packages I should optomize for Pentium. One 
person answered GlibC. This got me thinking about GCC itself, so I asked on 
another list and got a few answers, most were ""don't even think about it"" but 
a few suggested GCC and one pointed me to Linux From Scratch.After having a good search around the lfs site, I've decided I'm going to 
give it a whirl. I've got a spare box and loads of free time, so why not ;-)The lfs site, however warns NOT to use optimizations when compiling GCC or 
GlibC? A quick google found PGCC, a Pentium optimizing patch for GCC, but the 
site does not seem to have been updated in quite some time?So, my general plan, and I'm taking my time with this:Partition the hard drive for the lfs set-up with 4 partitions, /, /usr, /var 
and /home.
Install a base Debian system into the /home  partition so I can build the 
rest of the system into the other partitions.
Using Debian, build the initial packages into the / and /usr partitions. I'll 
try to optimize GCC and GlibC in this first stage.
chroot to the / partition and re-build the base packages for shared libs.
strip de-bugging from the binaries and change the boot so the system boot 
from / rather than /home, then move /home to it's proper partition.All going well, I should now have a full base Linux system running that is 
fully optimized for my PentiumMMX including GCC and GlibC.Now I can build zlib and then X, again optimizing. And I can follow this with 
the various graphics libs, qt lib and finally KDE.If all goes well, I will probably repeate this for my Dual system, once I can 
find a match for the slot1 550Mhz PIII Iv'e got.I might even be tempted to write this up for the site.Cheers,	John Gay--

"The Electronic Telegraph Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected 
 By Bruce Johnston in Rome
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's
 traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six
 people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.
 
 
 Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena 
 Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio
 nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine,
 contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.
 
 Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take
 part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the
 off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.
 
 Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa
 did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.
 
 As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his
 mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.
 
 Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,
 was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.
 
 Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police
 yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers
 from video footage.
 
 Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as
 contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact
 that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.
 
 The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on
 the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade
 through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.
 But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.
 
 The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary
 undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last
 minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not
 grab their reins.
 
 The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'
 boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend
 Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.
 
 The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles
 of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of
 the Assumption of the Virgin.

"I suppose the main surprise here is that AOL is coming clean at all. After
all, its long-running game of talking interop, and doing everything possible
to prevent open standards in this arena, seemed to have been working fine,
with most end users completely oblivious to AOL's actions.http://www.quicken.com/investments/news/story/djbn/?story=/news/stories/dj/2
0020723/ON20020723000833.htmAmerica Online Scales Back Instant-Messaging Compatibility Efforts
Updated: Tuesday, July 23, 2002 01:23 PM ETDow Jones NewswiresNEW YORK -- America Online appears to be scaling back efforts to make its
instant-messaging service compatible with rival services.The unit of AOL Time Warner Inc. (AOL, news, msgs) said in a regulatory
filing it is now focusing on messaging interoperability methods that are
more limited in scope than the kind envisioned by the Federal Communications
Commission when it approved the AOL-Time Warner merger in January 2001.America Online isn't required to make its messaging system interoperable
with others, but the FCC's merger approval included what it considered to be
incentives for the company to do so. It also required AOL to file progress
reports on its interoperability efforts every six months. The most recent
report, filed last week, disclosed the company's new direction.The upshot of the strategy shift is that the instant-messaging market isn't
much closer to broad-based interoperability than it was 18 months ago,
according to industry analysts. Unlike e-mail, users of most competing
instant-messaging services still can't directly trade messages. So an
America Online instant- messaging user can't communicate with a user of
Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT, news, msgs) MSN Messenger, except by using
third-party software such as Trillian.America Online, the biggest instant-messaging provider, has been criticized
for blocking users of rival services from gaining access to its users. The
company also has been accused of dragging its feet amid industry attempts at
interoperability.For its part, America Online has said it wants to protect the security of
its users and the reliability of its system. And it points out that other
companies have so far failed to agree on interoperability standards.When the FCC approved the AOL-Time Warner merger, it said that if America
Online wanted to offer video-conferencing and other advanced
instant-messaging features over Time Warner's cable lines, it first had to
enable its instant- messaging users to communicate with users of rival
services. The intent of the condition was to prevent America Online from
widening its dominance of the instant-messaging market by exploiting its
access to Time Warner cable systems.AOL hasn't yet introduced video features, even though rivals Microsoft and
Yahoo Inc. (YHOO, news, msgs) did so last year.Specifically, the FCC said America Online would have to implement a
technology known as ""server-to-server interoperability"" before it could
offer video. The technology would allow users of non-America Online services
to detect when AOL users are online, and to trade messages. It would do so
via communications between the computer servers operated by each messaging
provider, using a common language.But in the progress report filed with the FCC last week, America Online said
it will ""focus its efforts"" on alternatives to server-to-server
interoperability. They are more limited in scope than server-to-sever.As an example of an alternative, America Online cited a recent agreement to
make its instant-messaging service compatible with a new messaging service
from Apple Computer Corp. (AAPL, news, msgs). The Apple service, IChat, will
be included in Mac OS X 10.2, the new Apple operating system set for release
in August.IChat users will be able to talk to America Online users, but it won't
involve server-to-server interoperability. Instead, the actual exchange of
messages will occur only on America Online's servers, even as IChat
customers use Apple software.""We believe this kind of hosted IM solution provides, at least in the short
term, a secure, reliable and cost-effective means to provide
interoperability between AOL, IM and unaffiliated IM communities,"" Steven
Teplitz, AOL's associate general counsel, wrote in the progress report to
the FCC.As to the apparent change in strategy, company spokeswoman Kathy McKiernan
said Tuesday: ""It's a recognition that server-to-server has proven a hard
nut to crack for the entire industry."" Indeed, users of America Online's
rival services can't directly communicate with each other, either.The alternative solution ""was something that we could implement now to
provide for IM communities to communicate,"" said Ms. McKiernan, adding
America Online would explore partnerships with other messaging providers,
similar to the Apple deal. None has been announced so far.FCC officials couldn't be reached Tuesday.America Online hasn't ruled out the possibility that it would someday
implement server-to-server interoperability. The company has explored the
technology in the past, including a server-to-server last year with Lotus
Development, a unit of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM, news,
msgs).But America Online's interoperability test with Lotus was ""limited in scope
and functionality."" True server-to-server technology ""would require further
significant expenditures of time and resources to develop,"" wrote Mr.
Teplitz.The Internet Engineering Task Force, a group devoted to developing Internet
standards, has been working on a server-to-server messaging technology but
hasn't yet developed a final version, according to America Online. Task
force representatives couldn't be reached.The company's strategy shift means that true interoperability in instant
messaging is still a couple of years away, according to Michael Gartenberg,
analyst with Jupiter Research.""It's still something the market wants,"" he said. ""At some point, it'll
happen, but maybe a couple of years down the road.""Mr. Gartenberg and other analysts believe America Online hasn't actively
pursued true interoperability because it wants to protect its large user
base. If messaging systems were compatible, the company could lose ground
because prospective customers might see no difference in choosing another
provider, as long as they can reach America Online users.But partly because of its lack of compatibility and the FCC conditions,
America Online hasn't kept up with rivals in offering new services. MSN and
Yahoo have had video-conferencing via instant-messaging since last year. AOL
has denied that it has held back on video messaging to avoid making its
system interoperable, arguing there is little consumer demand for it.But the new features have paid off for the company's rivals, and they are
catching up. Between last October and April, Microsoft's Messenger user base
rose 32% to 29.1 million, according to ComScore Media Metrix, while Yahoo's
base jumped 19% to 19.2 million users. In the same period, the number of
users of AOL-branded messaging services increased 7% to 54.9 million.

Hash: SHA1I know it's not the popular choice for a lot of people, but I'd
suggest, um, church. :-). Like Woody Allen said, 90% of life is
showing up, right?
Almost anyone can find a church where the sermons don't make you bust
out laughing, and you're set. I, for instance, am a Unitarian, which,
as someone once observed, is merely a decompression chamber between a
real church and a golf course. (ObUUJokes: Mid 70's bumper-sticker:
""Honk if you're not sure""; Lenny Bruce: ""Did you hear about how the
Klan burned a question mark on the Unitarian's lawn?""; ""Unitarians
would rather go to a discussion group about heaven than to heaven
itself.""; ""Unitarians pray 'to whom it may concern'""; etc...)But, seriously, folks, my teenage-adopted denomination (I'm, um,
lapsed, on several fronts, a Dutch-Reformed-turned-atheist father and
an agnostic mother who used to be a southern Baptist of some stripe
or another) and frankly limousine liberal secular-humanist
congregation is about as orthogonal to my present
congenital-Republican small-l libertarian turned anarchocapitalist
politics as it is possible to be (except for the secular-humanist
bit...), and I still go pretty regularly, though not as much as I
used to. Heck, the older I get the less of the divine I believe in.
I'm asymptotically approaching my father's atheism, these days, and I
show up at least once a month. Nice folks though, when I can keep a
civil tongue in my head -- smart too, when I can't and end up arguing
with them. :-).
Anyway, if *I* can end up hitched, anyone can. Talk about orthogonal.
I met my practically-socialist state-education-bureaucrat wife one
year after I started, moved in with her 6 weeks later :-), married
her 2 years after that, and I wasn't even trying meet women. I was
just looking to make friends as I was new in town.
The trick to the church thing is, whatever denomination/congregation
you end up in, expect to end up with a mate, not a date. I mean, some
guys manage to stay single, but most, like me, don't. You can
practically see the laser-sights light up when you walk into a
room...That's because, of course, most churches are *run* by women. Most
regular attendants are women. Hell, 65% of all new *ministers*, in
protestant denominations, at least, are women. No matter your age,
looks, intelligence, whatever, you'll end up surrounded by women.
You'll be outnumbered, even several to one -- some of whom are at
least better looking than you are. :-). The only place where there
are *more* women running things is in grass-roots Republican politics
- -- but I won't go there, I promise.
If I may make a presumption here, since you brought it up, I figure
that between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinent's
religions, and the ubiquity of Indians in various stages of
assimilation in So/NoCal, you can find some place to hang out near
you, Rohit. You probably don't even have to go, um, native, like I
did -- backsliding on my own ostensibly rational godless upbringing
and becoming, horrors, a Unitarian...Cheers,

"comparative method the recent discussion of limitations on the comparative method contained several assertions that such limitations had been and were being used to justify resistance to proposals of remote relationships , including amerind and nostratic . to my knowledge this is absolutely false . in every instance that i am aware of in which perceived temporal limitations on the comparative method have been mentioned , it is by way of explaining why it is there are no relationships beyond a certain degree of remoteness on which there is consensus , or by way of making predictions as to what historical linguistics will ultimately be able to achieve . i do not know of a single instance in which someone has argued : such and such a proposed relationship is associated with a time-depth of x years . this exceeds the temporal limits of the comparative method . therefore the proposal must be wrong . if anyone can provide evidence of such an argument being made i would be most interested . in the particular case of amerind , the objections have been two-fold : ( a ) the data is riddled with errors ; ( b ) the argument is not of a sort that most historical linguists consider probative . since greenberg and ruhlen do not apply the comparative method disbelief in their claims could not rationally be based on perceived limitations of the comparative method , nor has it been . ironically , even if greenberg and ruhlen did attempt to apply the comparative method , amerind would not provide a very good instance of the above hypothetical argument . since even conservative estimates of the time-depth possible with the comparative method range from 6-10ky , cand since greenberg and ruhlen adhere to the low chronology for the peopling of the americas that places it at roughly 12ky bp , their date for amerind does not radically exceed the perceived limits of the comparative method . in sum , whatever the validity of proposed temporal limits on the comparative method , and i agree that such limits are far from exact , the view that this has anything to do with reactions to greenberg 's work on amerind and similar work is a red-herring . to evaluate such proposals , look at the data and look at the methodology , not at the alleged ( and generally unknowable ) motivations of the critics . you 'd think that the irrelevance of ad hominem arguments except in matters of credibility of witnesses would not need to be repeated constantly . bill poser bill poser , first nations studies , university of northern british columbia , 3333 university way , prince george , british columbia , v2n 4z9 , canada 604-960 - 6692",Safe Email

it might.  and that was my point, having these mythical symlinks point
to the device+inode is not simple.  just like the unrm thing, it might
be possible, but hard links and soft links are the best implementations
that have survived to date on unix.  windows shortcuts are kinda weird -
they're really an application level thing.mac aliases seem to take the idea of unix symlinks (linking by filename)
along with the concept of device+inode.  i don't know mac internals,
but i seem to remember being told it tried the former first, and then
tried the latter.  how it would deal with the 2nd example i mentioned i
dunno - i'm not certain if the mac version of inodes would suffer from
that (maybe the fs identifier for the file included the creation time
or something like that).> how do i control this 'symlinks magically link to new files' feature?i think it would be difficult.  it would also fail to work in numerous

"" the creditwatch placements recognize the uncertainties that surround the company and its credit quality in the short run due to the possibility of further anticipated developments in the capital markets , "" the rating agency wrote . wednesday ' s downgrade affects $ 500 million worth of notes , which are derivatives linked to enron ' s senior unsecured debt , now rated bbb . "" the investors are taking the risk of enron credit "" by purchasing the securities from the trusts even though these are not issued by enron , "" said tom fritz , a standard & poor ' s managing director . in addition , standard & poor ' s cut to bbb yosemite securities co . series 2000 - a . the obligations use enron ' s corporate rating as a backstop . the counterparty to yosemite and the credit - linked notes is citibank , fritz said . last week , j . p . morgan joined with salomon smith barney , which along with citibank is a unit of citigroup ( c : news , chart , profile ) , to extend $ 1 billion in new credit to enron to help the company ' s liquidity .

"Hi, 
I'm looking to build a completely silent pc. It's gonna be a gateway for
a wireless network and will sit in my room (as my room is only
spitting distance from the chimney where i'll be mounting the aerial) 
It has to be completely silent, or it'll do my nut. What do I need? I'll prob use a shitty p166 i have here, it doesnt have a fan, and I'm not
worried about HD noise too much as it'll be idle mostly (should I be?) 
any info would be appreciated. I can't afford one of those lovely new
shoebox size totally silent pcs and I cant use an old laptop as I have a
pci wireless card and cable already bought (160$ or so)And where can I get a fanless psu? I know they exist because the lads
at antefacto had them (lads, where can I get one?). Although I do remember
a slight lack of metal box around the humongous voltage parts!

"closings of academic depts and layoffs at san diego state on may 13 , san diego state university , facing a probable 8 . 5 % budget cut from state funding , amounting to about an $ 11 million shortfall , announced major eliminations of , and cuts in , academic programs . these cuts entail layoffs of tenured faculty . due to be shut down , with layoff of all faculty , are the departments of anthropology , german&russian , religious studies , natural sciences ( trains high school science teachers ) , family studies & consumer sciences , aerospace engineering , health sciences , and industrial studies . scheduled for cuts of faculty , of varying scale , in within-dept reverse order of seniority , are the departments of french&italian ( 3 of 11 ) , sociology ( 8 of 27 ) , math ( 8 of 60 or so ) , and chemistry ( 14 of 23 ) . the policy is to cut "" narrowly and deeply . "" although discussion has been going on all year in the senate about the potential for serious funding cuts and ways this university might respond to them , including program cuts , these cuts were announced suddenly , with no prior consultation with the affected departments . official notice to individual faculty members of layoff is scheduled for "" mid - june . "" > from that time laid-off faculty will have 120 days remaining on the payroll . the athletic department is eliminating golf , track and field , and one or two other minor sports , a cut of about $ 200 - $ 250k . the football and basketball programs are untouched ; the baseball program has lost a number of scholarships ( according to this morning 's sports section of the san diego union - tribune ) . at this point there is no word of cuts in administration . cuts in the school of business have apparently been trivial in comparison with those suffered by the college of arts and letters , the college of sciences , and other colleges . some affected faculty are contemplating legal action , and other remedies are being discussed . three administrative moves may have some potential for reversing the layoffs : cutting ( or eliminating ) intercollegiate athletics , instituting a golden handshake program , and instituting a university-wide salary reduction of up to 10 % . although the union is currently negotiating a golden handshake program , we do n't know how far along the negotiations are and whether it will be possible to put it in place quickly enough to have an effect on the current crisis . there are legal and adminstrative problems with the salary cut . we do n't know whether they ' re surmountable or not . the whole california state university system - - 20 campuses , including the new one at san marcos in northern san diego county - - face the same funding shortfall , but apparently ( we have at this point hardly any information ) campus responses vary a good deal . we ask that you consider writing to pres . thomas b . day , san diego state university , san diego , ca 92182 , expressing outrage at this unprecedented frontal assault on tenure and the centrality of academics to the university . if the attack is allowed to stand , the consequences for higher education within california and everywhere are incalculable . more importantly , we ask that you write to california state legislators and state senators . we will provide names and addresses if you contact us . we would be grateful for copies of any correspondence sent in connection with this crisis . we are sending this information out now , incomplete though it is , in order that linguists may be informed as early as possible in this developing crisis . jeff kaplan charlotte webb ( chair , linguistics and oriental languages dept )",Safe Email

"re : dun & bradstreet info for credit trading thank you for keeping us in the loop on this . d & b data will become one of our most important sources . as you suggest , the intent is to use this data along with other available date to generate a price for credit . the price will be published externally ( likely for a fee and as a free service ) via the web or via automated processes . option 3 appears to be the best solution for us given our desire for as up to date data as possible . stuart is working with the credit team to define additional data elements but the credit score and financial score are likely what we are looking for . alternatively , if it is possible to obtain the actual data that is used to generate the score that would allow us to generate our own score in addition to d & b ' s . we will need the global failure score as well . currently we are active in europe as well as the us and expect to move towards asia and austrailia over time . hopefully , this data is available via d & b connect . another consideration is the term of contract . we would likely prefer a longer term contract so that if they decide they don ' t like what we are doing with the data , we cannot be cut off . does it make sense from your perspective to approach d & b to be our long term , strategic providor of customer data . this would likely make their deal maker look good in his boss ' s eyes , give you lot ' s of negotiating ability and give a us the long term preferential contract that we are looking for . let ' s discuss further . bryan mary solmonson 05 / 05 / 2000 19 : 25 to : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , bryan seyfried / lon / ect @ ect cc : philippe a bibi / hou / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , stuart ffoulkes / lon / ect @ ect subject : dun & bradstreet info for credit trading i have received preliminary information from d & b . i think several issues / questions have been raised that if explored , could result in a better solution for the money . option 1 the update frequency for our current file can be improved from quarterly to monthly for a cost of $ 87 , 000 ( usd ) through march , 2001 . option 2 i wasn ' t sure what specific data in the file you might be interested in . if you are particularly interested in the financial stress score and credit score , for example , there are multiple alternatives : 2 a ) keep quartlery refresh of base data ( party name , etc ) and refresh scores that are added / changed on a monthly basis . cost - $ 1 . 17 ( usd ) per record . note that there are 575 , 000 records in the file currently with financial and credit scores , making this potentially a very expensive alternative ( 575 , 000 x 1 . 17 = $ 672 , 750 ) . 2 b ) batch or ftp updates of the financial and stress scores can only be provided monthly . d & b is working on a solution that would provide a weekly update to their customers in a batch or ftp manner , but has not committed to when this will be ready . therefore , if more timely updates than monthly are desired , it is also possible to transactionally access records one at a time using d & b ' s software . the cost for this is extremely high at $ 10 . 52 ( usd ) per score . option 3 d & b connect product . d & b connect is a tool set of matching software , an externally validated reference file , credit and marketing information , and d & b services that enables the most effective integration of customer information and third - party information with d & b information . only this type of process and information integration capability can facilitate and ensure accurate identification , linkage and maintenance of your customer ' s complete relationship . in addition , d & b connect assures organizations of referential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to d & b so that the most recent d & b information is always transmitted to your organization and updated within your local d & b connect reference file . d & b connect is scalable . cost typically ranging from * customer access module ( cam ) batch - - $ 25 , 000 * cam online - $ 50 , 000 * full information integrator - $ 350 , 000 + data with more specifics as to your needs , this option should perhaps be pursued . questions / issues 1 ) d & b had questions regarding the use of their data and whether enron customers would be offered this information for a fee or free . i explained that i did not feel the data would be offered directly to enron customers , but that it would be used to support analysis that would be available externally via web site , etc . all pricing above is based upon this understanding . if i have not portrayed the usage correctly , it will be imperative to get a better understanding before final pricing can be negotiated . 2 ) are there specific data elements that you are interested in ? alternatives may vary by data element . financial stress score and credit score reference above were explored as an example . 3 ) what is timeframe for needing a solution ? 4 ) financial stress score and credit score are only available on u . s . companies . a comparable measure - global failure score ( the liklihood of default or bankruptcy ) is available for international companies . this rating score however , is not currently available via a batch or ftp manner . this could result in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this score in a batch manner . 5 ) pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit analysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes . this is probably negotiable as the data is the same . the thought process is that if the repository is used for credit or risk decisions , d & b will see decreased usage and revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments . if you would like me to follow up further , please give me a call at 713 - 853 - 6079 .",Safe Email

No that is appropriate content for the file.  I'm not a C programmer,
but I think that these sort of things (#include ) are
instructions to the compiler processed by a pre-processor in the compile
process, and include all sorts of symbols/functions
e.g. ""#include "" gives you maths type functions.  Since they
start with ""#"" they are ignored in the final compilation.Regarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel
software to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. 
I recall from your previous mail that there was a flag
    --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4
which could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate
directory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).  This might allow you to
persuade the code to compile against the correct headers.  I think this
is the right way to proceed.Alternatively, maybe the steps above regarding ""make dep"" and so forth
should have been performed in the directory where the make process is
looking for modversions.h & Co.I don't think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as
you describe below.  First of all you will move modversions.h (which you
have done), then you would have to move all those *.ver files, after
that, there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h)
files.  This could be quickly done, but is probably bad (those files
don't really belong there).For what it's worth I think you are very close to a successful
compilation.m>

Don't know much about eRoom - but there is the magic phrase 'collaborate in

actually /benefit/ from collaborating in real-time.

http://www.internetwk.com/breakingNews/INW20021004S0001Content-management vendor Documentum said late Thursday it plans to acquire
privately held e-Room Technologies in a deal worth about $100 million.Documentum will issue approximately 7.7 million shares of its common stock
and pay about $12.6 million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of
eRoom.Documentum makes a platform for enterprise-wide content management. ERoom
makes tools for enterprise collaboration. Its customers include Airbus,
Bausch & Lomb, Ford Motor Co., and Sony.Documentum announced plans this summer to deliver a new Collaboration
Edition of its content-management suite. ERoom was already integrating its
tools to the Documentum platform, making an acquisition an easy target,
according to Documentum president and CEO Dave DeWalt.With the upcoming joint product, customers will be able to collaborate in
real-time via virtual workspaces, sharing schedules, resources, and even
jointly creating content.Content creation and management has always been a collaborative task, but
workflow has usually been delivered via a Web browser interface or even
simple e-mail -- and rarely in real-time.For now, Documentum will sell the eRoom platform and its own
content-management system through combined sales channels. Further
integration is planned down the line, the companies said.",Safe Email

expression).At the same time, it might be worth testing for username in HTML
comments.  I found some  types in HTML comments, but I
haven't seen enough hits so far to bother (however, I did add a really
good test for email addresses in comments).Dan

Quite some modules from CPAN do have a line like this nowadays (I think or 
read so somewhere, respectively). And the Perl error message is very clear: 
""ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
Makefile.PL line 2.""

I could think of a solution: We could remove the ""use"" line and add the 
version to PREREQ_PM. After WriteMakefile() we could add the lines 
  require ExtUtils::MakeMaker; 
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker->VERSION(5.45); 
to do per hand what 'use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45' does automagically; `perl 
Makefile.PL` will die with a ""Uncaught exception from user code: 
ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
Makefile.PL line 103."" there but we've got a Makefile. But I don't know if 
CPAN will run the make anyway...

We could call the preprocessor on install time. That's not a very clean 
approach but could work. 
 
We can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the Makefile directly per postamble. We 
already have a useless line ""pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made"" there. Adding 
some commands in this section gives some make warnings (""Makefile:933: 
warning: overriding commands for target `pm_to_blib' Makefile:877: warning: 
ignoring old commands for target `pm_to_blib'"") but does work. Not a very good 
solution either.

The ""use MakeMaker::..."" error message is IMHO quite clear, so I think it's ok 
to require the user to do a manual update of ExtUtils::MakeMaker before the SA 
installation. But that's just my opinion ;-) 
 
I'll ask on makemaker@perl.org for the best solution. They should know. ------- You are receiving this mail because: -------

No taxes on business or individuals > for a start. Great environment for banking and commerce. Good > protection of property rights. Small non-interventionist > government.Clearly you've never met ""Triumph"", the Fabulous Crotch-Sniffing Caymanian Customs Wonder Dog at extreme close range, or heard the story about the expat's college age kid, actually born on Cayman, who was literally exiled from the island when the island constabulary ""discovered"" a marijuana seed or three in his summer-break rental car a few years back.I mean, his old man was some senior cheese at Global Crossing at the time, but this was back when they could do no wrong. If that's what they did to *his* kid, imagine what some poor former junk-bond-hustler might have to deal with someday for, say, the odd unauthorized Cuban nightlife excursion. A discretely folded twenty keeps the stamp off your passport on the ground in Havana, and a bottle of Maker's Mark goes a long way towards some interesting nocturnal diversion when you get there and all, but still, you can't help thinking that Uncle's going to come a-knockin', and that Cayman van's going to stop rockin' some day, and when it does, it ain't gonna be pretty. Closer to home, conceptually at least, a couple of cryptogeeken were hustled off and strip-searched, on the spot, when they landed on Grand Cayman for the Financial Cryptography conference there a couple of years ago. Like lots of cypherpunks, these guys were active shooters in the Bay Area, and they had stopped in Jamaica, Mon, for a few days on the way to Grand Cayman. Because they, and their stuff, reeked on both counts, they were given complementary colorectal examinations and an entertaining game of 20 questions, or two, courtesy of the Caymanian Federales, after the obligatory fun and games with a then-snarling Crotch-Sniffing Caymanian Wonder Dog. Heck, I had to completely unpack *all* my stuff for a nice, well-fed Caymanian customs lady just to get *out* of the country when I left. Besides, tax havens are being increasingly constrained as to their activities these days, because they cost the larger nation-states too much in the way of ""escaped"" ""revenue"", or at least the perception of same in the local ""free"" press. Obviously, if your money ""there"" isn't exchangeable into your money ""here"", it kind of defeats the purpose of keeping your money ""there"" in the first place, giving folks like FinCEN lots of leverage when financial treaties come up for renegotiation due to changes in technology, like on-line credit-card and securities clearing, or the odd governmental or quango re-org, like they are wont to do increasingly in the EU, and the US.As a result, the veil of secrecy went in Switzerland quite a while ago. The recent holocaust deposit thing was just the bride and groom on that particular wedding-cake, and, as goes Switzerland, so goes Luxembourg, and of course Lichtenstein, which itself is usually accessible only through Switzerland. Finally, of course, the Caymans themselves will cough up depositor lists whenever Uncle comes calling about one thing or another on an increasingly longer list of fishing pretexts.At this point, the ""legal"", state-backed pecuniary privacy pickings are kind of thin on the ground. I mean, I'm not sure I'd like to keep my money in, say, Vanuatu. Would you? Remember, this is a place where a bandana hanging on a string across an otherwise public road will close it down until the local erst-cannibal hunter-gatherer turned statutorily-permanent landowner figures out just what his new or imagined property rights are this afternoon. The point is, any cypherpunk worth his salt will tell you that only solution to financial or any other, privacy, is to make private transactions on the net, cheaper, and more secure, than ""transparent"" transactions currently are in meatspace. Then things get *real* interesting, and financial privacy -- and considerably more personal freedom -- will just be the icing on the wedding cake. Bride and groom action figures sold separately, of course.Cheers, RAH (Who went to FC2K at the Grand Cayman Marriott in February that year. Nice place, I liked Anguilla better though, at least at the time, and I haven't been back to either since. The beaches are certainly better in Anguilla, and the ""private"" banking system there is probably just as porous as Cayman's is, by this point. If I were to pick up and move Somewhere Free outside Your Friendly Neighborhood Unipolar Superpower, New Zealand is somewhere near the top of my list, and Chile would be next, though things change quickly out there in ballistic-missile flyover country. In that vein, who knows, maybe we're in for some kind of latter-day Peloponnesian irony, and *Russia* will end up the freest place on earth someday. Stranger things have happened in the last couple of decades, yes?)-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: PGP 7.5iQA/AwUBPVYS48PxH8jf3ohaEQKwtgCgw/XSwzauabEP/8jDvUVk/rgFdroAn0xf Owk90GoK+X5Pv+bGoKXCwzBK =1w9d -----END PGP SIGNATURE------- ----------------- R.

  | From: ""Matthew French"" 
  | 
  | Niall asked:
  |  > I have about 60G of data which I need to copy from one disk to

  | 
  | How about something like:
  | 
  |    cd {dest.dir}
  |    tar -C {source.dir} cf - | tar xf -
  | 
  | tar cf - will pipe the tar file to stdout and tar xf - will untar it. This
  | should keep permissions and links, and if you do it as root you will keep
  | the owners too... :)
  | 
  | Not tested, though. You may need other flags as well. the above (or something close to it) will work. however, the data will be read and written twice by the
 1st (source) `tar', and read twice by the 2nd (sink) `tar',
 albeit only written once as the sink realizes the second
 copy is a hard link to the first.  with c.60Gb of data,
 that will make a difference, at least in time and CPU
 resource consumed (albeit, in this case, not storage). the issue here is tar(1) (and cpio(1)) archives always
 contain the data for each name of a hard link.  this is
 (probably) for several reasons, and is not necessarily a
 bad thing.   e.g., it provides a degree of redundancy to
 help cope with bad media. the source `tar' is creating an archive, which is being
 written down the pipe (to be consumed by the sink `tar').
 that is why storage is not an issue per se here, as the
 full archive is not ""saved"" --- if it were, you'd need
 at least 2x60Gb, or over 120Gb!   (the extra is `tar's
 overhead, which is minimal but does add up, esp. when
 a ""large"" blocking factor is used.)cheers!

"re : 5 . 1500 comparative method , polarization & reviews i am forwarding the following for posting at the request of robert rankin ( rankin @ ukanvm . cc . unkans . edu ) . i do not subscribe to this list and have no wish to join the fray at present , but when my name is mentioned sometimes the file is forwarded to me via e-mail . thus the following : andy anderson cites me on three points in a series of recent postings . i have known andy upwards of 30 years and do not feel that he would in - tentionally misrepresent my views , but i also feel a couple of things need clarification . first , i am uncomfortable about being formally cited as a ( secondary ) source of information on lyle campbell 's paper from the boulder ( green - berg ) conference of ca . 1990 . if andy wishes to distribute an attack on the paper or its author in written form , he should first obtain an actual copy of it or , alternatively , await its publication . i guess i should n't have brought it up in our conversation at the ssila / aaa meetings . second , i am said to have reported that the geneticists who have studied the mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) of sundry native american and siberian peo - ples claim that there were / are "" two subgroups within amerind ( aside from the eskimo and athabaskans ) . "" this is not what i ( or the paper 's authors wallace , torroni and schurr , et al . ) said . the authors did not address themselves to the linguistic problems and most certainly did n't talk about "" subgroups "" . nor did i , since i do not regard the historicity of anything like "" amerind "" as even remotely established . the authors of the paper did posit at least four "" migrations "" . they do not discuss the most recent , eskomo - aleut , in their abstract , but i think they gave a time depth figure of about 6000 years bp ( before present ) for it orally - - do n't quote me . from their abstract : for what they call na - dene their figure is 7000-10000 years bp . then they say they have evidence for at least two "" migrations "" preceding that . one comes between 12000-15000 bp and the earliest between 26000-34000 bp . figures as high as 40000 bp were mentioned orally , as i recall . they did not attempt to correlate their figures with our knowledge of periods of glaciation or the periodic existence of the land bridge in beringia . i leave it to readers to decide what this portends for the amerind hypo - thesis or its proposed ( glotto ) chronology , but a warning is in order in any event . note that i have written "" migration "" in quotes above . this is not because i wish to pejorate the term ; it is because geneticists use it in a very special way . for them it has to do solely with the ap - pearance of specific genetic material in american populations . they then assume a common ancestor and calculate the number of millennia by positing a uniform mutation rate for mtdna . the material and theories they work with force this definition of migration on them . all this says nothing about the situation "" on the ground . "" in reality though , each of these genetic migrations can have included many distinct movements of people across beringia over a great many years - - perhaps centuries or even millennia . and they may have represented many ling - guistic groups . all that is required in order for entire clusters of migrations "" on the ground "" to get read as a single mtdna "" migration "" is a relatively homogeneous gene pool in eastern siberia over the particular time span when the "" genetic mutation "" occurred . the evidence does indeed suggest four genetic migrations , but it really says little or nothing about how many "" real "" migrations there were with - in each of the four clusters , nor does it say anything about linguistic diversity - - much less "" subgroups of amerind . "" we may wish it did , but it does n't . i do note with interest however the rough correlation between the geneticists ' oldest figures and the calculations of nichols ( 1990 in language 66 . 3 ) based on linguistic diversity in the western hemisphere . the more recent sets of mtdna dates fall within the esta - blished archaeological ballpark for clovis believers , although the earliest set certainly does not . one very short contribution of my own here - - mostly my wife 's actually , since she is a molecular geneticist and we talk about these things over breakfast . the yardstick used by mtdna geneticists in these cal - culations may not be appreciably better than that used in glottochrono - logy , i . e . , genetic mutation takes place at a rate which is only rela - tively constant . it can be speeded up by various singular events from cosmic ray bombardment to ingesting certain fungi infecting the grain from your cache pit . biologists try to allow for this sort of thing , but as you can see from the plus / minus dates for each cluster , we are not talking about something as precise as dendrochronology or even radiocarbon dating . the mtdna studies are very interesting but we must bear in mind their limitations and special use of the term "" migration "" . lastly , in an earlier posting andy mentions that i had examined green - berg 's notebooks and determined how he had mislabeled so much of his siouan data in lia . andy 's description of the way the notebooks are laid out is correct , but i have only actually seen xeroxes of the pages of siouan entries , not the notebooks themselves . i might add that the siouan entries in the notebook are hard by the iroquoian , caddoan , yuchi entries demonstrating once again that greenberg had decided on the final classification of these families when he laid out his notebook design and before the vocabularies from the languages were entered . my thanks to john koontz for posting this . sincerely , bob rankin ( university of kansas ) ( rankin @ ukanvm . cc . ukans . edu )",Safe Email

"http://www.abc.net.au/news/justin/weekly/newsnat-26jul2002-53.htmPlayStation owners win copyright caseOwners of PlayStation consoles who modify their machines to play games
bought overseas have had a win in the Federal Court.Sony Computer Entertainment has failed in its claim that ""chipping"" breaks
copyright laws.Sony launched legal proceedings against a Sydney man, Eddy Stevens, for
allegedly selling pirated games and also providing and installing
modification chips.PlayStation consoles in Australia are different from those in the US and
Japan because of the different television formats.The court was told ""chipping"" allows people to play legitimately bought
overseas games and copies of games, but also pirated games.The judgement by Federal Court Justice Ronald Sackville says Sony failed
to prove that PlayStation consoles have a copyright protection measure
installed in the first place and therefore could not rule that a mod chip
breaks copyright legislation.Mr Stevens was found to have infringed trademark rules in relation to the
pirated games he sold a matter which will come before the court again next
month.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

"ferc ' s 4 / 26 / 01 order on california price mitigation per voicemail . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by richard shapiro / na / enron on 04 / 27 / 2001 07 : 04 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - subject : ferc ' s 4 / 26 / 01 order on california price mitigation if you read ray alvarez ' s summary from yesterday evening , open the attached word document and read only the changes that we made to the summary since receiving the final order , which was issued this afternoon . alan comnes the full order is available at : http : / / www . ferc . fed . us / electric / bulkpower . htm summary of ferc ' s order establishing prospective mitigation and monitoring plan for the california wholesale electric markets and establishing an investigation of public utility rates in wholesale western energy markets ( issued april 26 , 2001 ) effective date - - price mitigation is effective may 29 , 2001 . ( iso needs to have its day - ahead proxy price ready on 5 / 28 ) physical withholding - - to prevent physical withholding , the plan will require sellers with pga ' s to offer all their available power in real time to the extent not scheduled in bilateral trade . all california generators , even those not subject to ferc price regulation , will be required to sell into the iso ' s real time market as a condition of their use of the iso ' s interstate transmission lines . hydroelectric facilities will be exempted . ( this requirement to provide power is for all hours ( 24 / 7 ) for lyr ) price mitigation - the plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market . during stage 1 , 2 and 3 emergencies in the iso ' s real time market , each generator ( other than hydro ) with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generator ' s heat curve , emission rates , gas costs and emission costs , plus $ 2 / mwh for o emissions are to be based on cantor fitzgerald environmental brokerage services . the iso will publish by 8 : 00 am , the gas and emission figures to be used for the next day in any hour where an emergency is declared . these figures ( for the next day ) will be based on the prior day ' s gas daily and cantor fitzgerald data . a single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators . highest bid sets the clearing price . each gas - fired generator must file with ferc and the iso within 5 days , on a confidential basis , heat and emission rates for each generating unit . the iso will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator , including maintenance and operating costs . generators that submit bids at or below the market clearing price will not be subject to refund liability . ( although the following qualification is made : "" however , all public utility rates will be subject to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on market - based rates , discussed infra . "" presumably this has to do with anomalous bidding behavior . ) in the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price , the generator must , within 7 days of the end of each month , file a report with ferc and the iso justifying its price . ferc explicitly acknowledges that some units may have gas costs that exceed the "" all delivery point "" index it has adopted . ferc has 60 days to review / act . no opportunity costs in real time . marketers are not held to any generator cost standard but must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost . underscheduling penalites - - ferc acknowledges that the there is a pending request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it is still in place . thus , although it may be advantageous to wait to buy power in r / t at capped prices , doing so may make the scheduling coordinator subject to the currently effective $ 100 / mwh penalty . see p . 20 of the ferc order . new generation - - new generation is not exempted from the commission ' s price mitigation measures . demand response - - beginning june 1 , only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids . ferc is attempting to make the demand curve more price responsive . ( this requirement is in effect for all hours ( 24 / 7 ) ) outages - - pga generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages the iso is required to make a tariff filing within 15 days of the order proposing a mechanism for coordination and control of outages , including periodic reports to the commission . term - order expires one year from date of issuance . rto filing - california iso and two utilities must make rto filing by june 1 or order lapses with no further effect . the rto filing is to be consistent with the characteristics and functions in order no . 2000 . iso reporting - on september 14 , 2001 , iso must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built . comments are due in 15 days . quarterly reports thereafter . revocation of market based rate authority and refunds - the market based rate authority of all public utilities is conditioned on ( 1 ) no physical withhold of capacity , and ( 2 ) no inappropriate bidding behavior . inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior . an increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate . in addition , "" hockey stick "" bids are expressly prohibited ( i . e . bidding 95 % at marginal cost and 5 % at a much higher level ) . other prohibited bidding practices identified include : pricing a single unit much higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due to increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs . west - wide section 206 investigation - opens a section 206 investigation concerning the j & r of wholesale power in the wscc other than sales to the caiso market . ferc requests comments on the scope and nature of price mitigation . however its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in real time ( markets for power less than 24 hours in advance of r / t ) spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below 7 % within a control area . ferc is attempting to mirror the rules applied in california . comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations . although it is still formulating its price mitigation plan for the non - california pnw , the ferc sets the refund effective date is 60 days from publication of the order . nox limits in california - - must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law . however , it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement - just include the fines as part of the price bid . also if nox is limited , may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price . surcharge to pay past amount due - - comments are due in 30 days on ( 1 ) whether ferc should require the iso to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow account to pay past costs and ( 2 ) the effect this surcharge would have on the pg & e bankruptcy filing . treatment of the caiso ' s market stabilization plan ( msp ) . the ferc rejects the caiso ' s msp saying that ferc ' s plan for market mitigation is sufficient . it expressly rejects caiso ' s plan to create a day - ahead and hour - ahead energy markets are expressly reject and tells caiso to stop actions to implement software changes to effectuate such markets . unfortunately , it does not expressly reject caiso ' s plan to cut exports . in general , no mention was made as to issue of exports of power from california although the statement that caiso must become a real rto would support the notion that caiso must honor firm schedules on its system . . recap of dates identified in the order ? issue date : 4 / 26 / 01 ? heat rate emission filing from generators due : 5 days ( 5 / 1 / 01 ) ? comments due on wscc - wide price mitigation : 10 days ( 5 / 6 / 01 ) ? iso tariff filing due : 15 days ( 5 / 11 / 01 ) ? comments on iso tariff due : 5 days thereafter ( 5 / 16 / 01 ) ? comments on whether commission should allow a premium to recover unpaid generator bills : 5 / 30 / 01 ? effective date of proxy prices : 5 / 29 / 01 ? demand responsive bids from load serving entities : 6 / 1 / 01 ? refund effective date begins : 60 days after publishing in federal register ( late june ? ) ? first iso quarterly report : 9 / 14 / 01 ? comments on first iso quarterly report : 15 days thereafter ( 9 / 29 / 01 ) ? plan terminates : 4 / 26 / 02 ra & gac",Safe Email

me that the problem with passport is the same one you noted with the

Personally i'd never trust them not to at least use it internally to

5. SITE STATISTICS
0. INTROHello SourceForge.net Users,This week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any
large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to
the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you.
These databases manage everything from user authentication, session
management, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database-
dependent website.Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2,
a powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because
the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and
70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this
growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us
the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the
press release here:http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.htmlHow will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much
difference other then the site will continue to grow and the
SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later
phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of
the databases advanced capabilities.Today our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the
site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months.If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site,
please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always
appreciate the feedback.Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the
Open Source Community.Pat-Patrick McGovern
Director, SourceForge.net1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITYSourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth
is never-ending.  Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to
ensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source
community can always obtain the software released by hosted
projects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity
download servers.  These servers are located throughout the world,
as to provide better download times regardless of which network
provider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location.Three new download servers have recently been added to our network,
further strengthening our file serving capabilities.  These latest
additions include servers hosted by:Time Warner Telecom (Wisconsin,USA);
http://www.twtelecom.com/University of Minnesota (Minnesota, USA)
http://www.umn.edu/CESNET (Czech Republic)
http://www.cesnet.cz/We thank these sponsors for their commitment to SourceForge.net and
the needs of the Open Source community.On a related note, we are looking for a mirror in Japan.  If you are
an ISP or University in Japan and are willing to spare 20Mbps for a
SourceForge.net mirror (we'll supply the hardware), please let us
know at bandwidth@sourceforge.net2. AUDIO OF KERNEL SUMMIT AVAILABLESourceForge.net now has the audio from the entire 2002 OSDN/USENIX
Kernel Summit, held in June.  Listen to the Linux kernel master
discuss such hot topics as kernel modules, virtual memory,
block I/O, database scaling, security modules, and async I/O.
You may find this audio repository at:http://linuxkernel.foundries.sourceforge.net/article.pl?sid=02/06/26/01162253. CONTRIBUTE TO SOURCEFORGE.NET! BE A FOUNDRY GUIDE!Want to contribute to SourceForge.net, but you don't know how to
code? Be a foundry guide!  Foundry guides get to hype the cool
projects that they think are worth downloading and testing.
A guide finds all the stuff on the web about their subject of
choice, and gives it prominent placement.  How do you become a
foundry guide? Go to http://foundries.sourceforge.net/; find a
topic that interests you; and send email to
foundries@sourceforge.net stating your desired topic and why you
are qualified to be a foundry guide.4. WORK FOR SOURCEFORGE.NETWe have a new position for a senior web developer available at

replies that look like this:  ""Hey!! I didn't subscribe to this list!!!
You spammer. I hate you!  I hate your dog!  (insert other colorful
phrases here)"".  The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net
there was a check box that said ""Receive Site-wide updates, low
volume"".  You left it checked when you submitted the registration form,
hence you are receiving this email.  We send these updates every 4 to 6
weeks, so it truly is low volume.  However if you want off, this is not
a problem.  Simply click on the link below.

be crawling around in registers and things. Quite frankly you cant fit

( b ) phonological phrases must have edgemost phrasal prominence . ( c ) syntactic phrases must contain phrasal prominence . these demands are taken to interact with one another as ranked and violable constraints , where variation among languages is expressed in terms of constraint reranking . each relation is argued for independently . the effects of ( a ) ( previously analyzed as the role of government in phonological phrasing ) will be investigated on patterns of phrasing in the bantu languages chi mwi : ni , chichewa , and kimatuumbi . the effects of ( b ) , it is argued , can be seen most clearly in the effects of focus on phrasing , where chichewa and japanese will be discussed as examples . the effects of ( c ) , finally , which have been discussed in different contexts as either a directionality parameter of the role of depth of embedding in the assignment of stress , will be argued to have desirable typological consequences that set ( c ) apart from some of its competitors . jointly , the constraints will be seen to derive an end-based typology of the kind familiar from work by lisa selkirk . ordering information : http : / / broca . mit . edu / mitwpl . web / wpls . html",Safe Email

or can multimodal retrieval techniques be combined to create queries suitable for image , video and audio retrieval ? in general , a question is how can we create realistic queries for realistic systems . the third focus of this workshop is on evaluation techniques for multimedia retrieval . currently , most researchers are using the standard evaluation measures defined for text documents ; these need to be extended / modified for multimedia documents . there is also a high degree of subjectivity involved that needs to be addressed . we will focus on the following specific topics : - content analysis and retrieval from various media ( text , images , video , audio ) - interaction of modalities ( e . g . text , images ) in indexing , retrieval - effective user interfaces ( permitting query refinement etc . ) - evaluation methodologies for multimedia information . we have found that researchers pay insufficient attention to it . - techniques for relevance ranking - multimodal query formation / decomposition - logic formalisms for multimodal queries - indexing and retrieval from scanned documents - e . g extracting text from images , word spotting - as a retrieval technique for both handwritten and printed documents . - testbeds for evaluating multimodal retrieval : it would be nice to have some resource sharing here since annotating these , and coming up with a good query set are difficult participation : two types of participation are expected . those interested in making a presentation at this workshop should submit their full papers either in online postscript version or in hardcopy by regular mail to the address given below . the papers should not exceed 5 , 000 words , including figures , tables , and references . those interested in participating , but not presenting papers , should submit a statement of interest , not to exceed 500 words . this should clearly state what aspect ( s ) of the workshop reflect their research interest . these will be used to select panelists . both types of submissions are due on friday , june 5th . decisions will be made no later than friday , june 26th . in the case of paper submission , the final camera-ready papers are due on july 24th . working notes will be made available to all participants at the workshop . all the submissions should be sent to : prof . rohini k . srihari , cedar / suny at buffalo ub commons 520 lee entrance , suite 202 amherst , ny 14228 - 2583 rohini @ cedar . buffalo . edu organization : workshop chairs ( also program chairs ) rohini k . srihari , suny at buffalo ( rohini @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) zhongfei zhang , suny at buffalo ( zhongfei @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) r . manmatha , university of massachussetts ( manmatha @ cs . umass . edu ) s . ravela , university of massachussetts ( ravela @ cs . umass . edu ) program committee members : shih - fu chang ( columbia u . , usa ) david harper ( robert gordon university , u . k . ) alex hauptmann ( cmu , usa ) rakesh kumar ( sarnoff , usa ) desai narasimhalu ( isi , singapore ) candace sidner ( lotus , usa ) peter schauble ( eth , switzerland ) timetable : paper or statement of interest submission : june 5th , 1998 decision : july 19th , 1998 camera - ready paper due : july 24th , 1998 sigir conference : august 24th - 28th , 1998 workshop : august 29th , 1998 further information : further questions may be directed to the address above , or go to the web page of this workshop at http : / / www . cedar . buffalo . edu / sigir98 / mmtr . html or the sigir conference main web page at http : / / www . cs . mu . oz . au / sigir98 /",Safe Email

Cambodia temple ruins yield treasureWorkers clearing dense jungle near the ruins of an ancient pagoda in
northern Cambodia have unearthed 31 Buddha statues - 27 of them solid gold.
The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in good
condition and believed to be hundreds of years old.
They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich temple
about 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh.
The pagoda, in the Batay district of Kampong Thom province, was torn down
during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and the area became
overgrown.
Community care
Deputy police chief of Kampong Thom province, Hang Sithim, said the statues
- three of which were silver and one bronze - were buried in about one metre
(3.4ft) of earth and each weigh around 500 grams (1lb).
''I think that these Buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago,
when the last temple was fully operating,"" Mr Hang Sithim said.
Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearby
town for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at the
temple to take care of them.
''We believe they are safe there,'' said Som Somphat, deputy governor of
Kampong Thom province.
''The people of Po Pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.''
Reign of terror
A police guard has been placed around the site to protect it from looters.
The Khmer Rouge waged civil war in Cambodia between 1970 and 1998 and
controlled the country between 1975 and 1979.
The regime outlawed religion and destroyed many objects regarded as decadent
or culturally impure.
About two million people died in the Khmer Rouge's drive to turn Cambodia
into a farmers' utopia.

[ Messages on the IEDR-FORUM list at the time don't support 
  your assertion ]As an aside, shortly after my note on Friday uucp-gw-1.pa.dec.com and
uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com stopped responding to DNS requests. So IE had
two dead nameservers, four stuck a week in the past and three
working correctly. Marvellous.

  Test the hub ports by switching cables around.
  Run ifconfig on the server - any errors and what kind they are.
  Test the network card... by replacing the thing!Seriously, if the server has a PCI slot free, something like a Realtek 8139
based card costs less than 20 euro.  The design is a couple of generations later
- more memory, less cruft, no *FSCKING* dos config utility, no jumpers on the
card and it's PCI.  Ronan.

Of course they had to do this AFTER we purcahsed these all on vhs, and yes
it is now run by the great evil empire known as disney...but we got the
new School House Rocks DVD anyway and man is it an amazing item.First off , my 8 year old has been singing them since she was 6. Second
off, these are much easier to rip to divx and mp3. Third, new songs,
remastered originals and other dvd goodies. Its a 2 dvd set so its well
worth the 17$ we paid for it.Even if you dont have kids, run do not walk to pick this one up.Man, I would sure love to have a *nix Rocks for the kids.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0%2c3858%2c4489999%2c00.htmlMaking a mesh on the moveA new way to give us fast mobile net access spells further trouble for 3G, 
reports Peter RojasPeter Rojas
Thursday August 29, 2002
The GuardianImagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than DSL from 
anywhere, at any time - you could watch a live video webcast while waiting 
for the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or 
download the MP3 of the song that's playing in the pub before it finishes.This is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the 
third-generation (3G) mobile phone companies have been promoting for 
years. 3G services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new 
technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision 
sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever 
dream.Two companies, US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany, 
are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. 
Instead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications, 
with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time 
""mesh-enabled"" devices - mobile phones, PDAs, laptops - are in close 
proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh 
network. Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying 
traffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it 
reaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central 
antennas, and improving wireless coverage.As the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and 
other devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless 
networking may be inevitable.Mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless 
networks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users 
connection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a 
dial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection 
speeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The 
technologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed 
wireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range 
protocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even 
faster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.The range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of 
much use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the 
problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. 
Even though the range of any individual device is relatively small, 
because (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, 
connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless 
connection.Because mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed 
to create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building 
cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all 
that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around 
Â£100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the 
proper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by 
software.It also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. 
Unlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on 
is unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too 
pleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds 
acquiring 3G licences.All that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect 
to the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets 
better, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone 
networks.But things get very interesting when you realise that when you have 
high-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, PDAs, 
and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing 
music, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When 
UltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.At 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the 
person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. 
Sooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of 
their favourite songs, movies, and video games.But the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. 
MeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. 
Instead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities 
that want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works 
employees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the 
cheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for 
enterprise networks.The first place average users may use the technology is when it is 
incorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at 
high speeds, which both companies see happening soon.When will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in 
your pocket? It's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service 
was initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually 
someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.

"Man Threatens Explosion In Moscow Thursday August 22, 2002 1:40 PM
MOSCOW (AP) - Security officers on Thursday seized an unidentified man who
said he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck in
front of Russia's Federal Security Services headquarters in Moscow, NTV
television reported.
The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man
got out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other details
were immediately available.
The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and
ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to
talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within
blocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the
man, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news
agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside
the building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.
The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove
to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held
further negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said. The
move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more
secure location. ------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

"we know you needed this , so . . . . greetings , this email is about fighting spam , and winning . > > please forward to your friends , family and co-workers to people that want to get spam out of their email : read this , you ' ll like what i am doing . . . . : ) to people that want to flame me for whatever reason : do n't be an egomaniac , i have a right to free speech , and the right to say it to a lot of people , so buzz off . - - - - - first let me tell you who i am and what i do . my name is robert young , i live in moscow , idaho , u . s . a . , and i have been using the internet since 1990 . i have watched the internet go from a small community of serious professionals to a roaring civilization of over 100 million people . until 8 months ago i had been a private investigator specializing in the apprehension of criminal fugitives . after 8 years of doing that i started getting burned out and decided to turn my life long hobby of programming computers into a full time job . now i write specialized applications for investigating and locating information on the internet . this summer , during the last week of july , i finally got fed up with the fact that i could not seem to get my 5 year old email address off of spam lists . i would reply to their emails with the word "" remove "" like most of them say and the next day i would get more . i sent my email address to remove lists , complained to administrators , postmasters , and my friends . none of it seemed to make a bit of difference . i decided to investigate the bulk email business . what i found made me so angry i almost blew a fuse . did you know : 1 . spammers steal valid email addresses and use them for return addresses . you could get the blame ! 2 . spammers purposely deceive filters designed to protect your email address . 3 . spammers "" hijack "" mail servers that are meant to relay messages from computer to computer . when they overload these servers , your legitimate email can be lost ! 4 . congress is not going to pass any laws in the united states anytime in the near future to stop this garbage , and they may never do so . some members of congress have actually campaigned through email . ( does that - really - surprise you ? ) 5 . when spammers register domain names with internic they never pay their bills because they know that the domain will be blocked and useless within 30 days , and interring gives them that long to pay before cutting them off . 6 . some spammers buy lists of accounts from hackers that have broken into internet service providers and use these accounts , that belong to other people , so they can connect to the internet without being concerned about losing the account . again , you get the blame , you lose your account . most of these spammers are genuine , authentic , certified jerks . i decided to get even , i took all of this very personally . within 3 weeks , the spam had dropped to a trickle . now i only get 2 or 3 a week instead of 7 or 8 each day . update : as of 02-oct - 1998 i have not gotten a single spam for 5 days . that 's a fact . i am starting to get comments from people that joined me two weeks ago that have noticed drops in their spam count of as much as 70 % . that is a fact as well . my list of active spammers is over 80 individuals now and it is growing every day . it does n't take government intervention , we all know that our government could n't feed a cat without spending $ 400 on a bag of cat food and starting 8 committees . what it does take is someone with the guts to take action , now ! what did i do ? first i recognized that spammers are not going to just quit , they make too much money doing it . the self righteous "" anti-spammers "" only wipeout mostly innocent business people with poor judgment . they have not put a single spam mailer out of business yet . not a one ! they just pop up with a different domain name , and dialup account the next day . the anti spammers have actually wiped out several potentially successful remove lists . you know why ? they do n't want it to end because then they would n't have a crusade anymore . think i ' m kidding ? i know who the anti-spammers are as well and believe me , their motivations are purely egotistical . in my opinion they have made spam worse by driving it underground and ruining the web based remove lists . try to go to www . remove-list . com , it is n't there anymore . so i am doing it different . human nature matters . . . i used my investigative experience to hunt down the - actual people - that were sending me spam . names , phone numbers , addresses , etc . it was n't easy but i had the background and knowledge to do it . i called each of these people and told them that if they did not immediately cease and desist sending mail to my address that i was going to give their name , address , phone number and anything else i had on them to every service provider in the country . that i would publish their information on the internet via the web , and that i would give their information to every ( legitimate ) anti - spam group i could find . i was polite and adult about the issue but i made it very clear that i was dead serious . nothing else has worked . people have been trying to get rid of spam for several years with no success . this method works ! ! ! if i told you i could do the same thing for you would you be interested ? i thought so . here is what you need to do : first : start your text editor ( notepad , vi , whatever ) second : type the following information and print it . first name last name primary email address ( remember your email may have two forms such as : joe @ isp . com and joe @ mail . isp . com . include both , contact your isp if you are n't sure ) family member ' s addresses ( one per line please ! ) third : mail this information to me : robert young attn : no more spam please ! ! ! c / o super fast services 116 e . 3rd . st . suite 206 moscow , id 83843 we need donations to support this fight . i started out doing this for friends and family , then their friends and family , and now it is starting to cost us a lot of money . please include a donation of five dollars either a five dollar bill , or a check made out to me . we are hoping that there are enough decent people out there that appreciate what we are doing and will pitch in a few bucks to help us pay for the phone calls , computer time , database searches , and hiring people to do the data entry for the 600 plus letters we are getting every day . p l e a s e h e l p ! i guarantee you will think it is the best five bucks you have ever spent if you are sick of spam . thanks for taking the time to reply to this letter , i hope to hear from you soon . working together we can defeat unwanted spam for good .",Phishing Email

AQUEOUS KATHMANDU
*********************************For those who choose not to smoke ... we have something for you.  Introducing Aqueous Kathmandu ""Happy Drops"" (tm).Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Happiness Drops....(Temple ""Quantum"" Variety)....Indeed; a Happiness Brew from the Kathmandu....a.k.a. ""Secret Fire""....from a toke-smoke point of view, if you know what I mean and be groovin' the scene.... Who du the Kathmandu?  Now....everybody can du the Kathmandu!  (that is, if you're 21 years of age or older....)  Aqueous Kathmandu is engaged to holistically inspire and instill ""sensitive/responsive""; happiness and mellowness without the detriment of carcinogenic inhalation (smoking).  Aqueous Kathmandu is absolutely legal and does not contain any controlled, considered to be harmful or regulated herbs or cannabis/marijuana factors!!!! As ""smoking"" has become so socially taboo over the years and as so many people have asked us for a liquid product, we have long strived to bring a quantum-factored/concentrated liquid product to fruition. This has been no easy task for a variety of botanical and technological reasons.  Finally; we are able to say that this task has been accomplished....a ""Sensitive"" herbal/botanical awakening, if you will....as we have introduced and brought to market Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) Happiness Drops, Temple ""Quantum"" Variety, a.k.a....""Secret Fire"".  ""Secret fire""....indeed!!!This liquid innovation affords us four factors within this particular botanical equation that were previously not realized....
1) The ability to engage a more substantial, high-ratio, concentrated application of particular botanical factors that are utilized in our personal-choice, ""sensitive/responsive"" pipe-smoking product.
2) The ability to extract high-ratio concentrates of certain botanical factors that are not applicable to a smoking commodity, as they cannot be extracted into dry format.  (Please note....all botanical factors included in all/any of our products are absolutely legal.  In the instance of Aqueous Kathmandu, we are simply able to enjoy the advantages of specific legal herbas that just are not dry concentrate-applicable.
3) A most notable assimilation factor....being that liquid is more easily and therefore more generally metabolistically assimilated and as such, more ""absolute""; in that herba/botanical applications via the administrative vehicle of ""Smoke"" possess a much wider variance in just how efficiently that ""Smoke"" is integrated metabolistically, psychologically and perspectively
4) Therein, we have created a unique uniqueness between a ""Smoke"" and a ""non-Smoke""....sort of like the camaraderie between indicas and sativas, if you will....different aspects of the same botanical genus arrangement.  Each ""impeccable"" singularly.... And at this juncture we will also mention to those of you who are not so anti-smoking something....that Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) Happiness Drops and the more traditional Temple ""3"" Ragga Dagga (tm) personal-choice, pipe-smoking substance indeed establish an enchanting ""camaraderie"". (Please refer to, ""Introductory Offers"".) * No need to smoke.  No carcinogenic factors!
* Absolutely legal!  No prescription required!
* Does not include cannibis or any tobacco variety.
* Marvelously potent.  Remarkably substantial!
* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity!
* Adjusts attitude & mood enhancement. Relaxes stress & anxiety.
* Better than Kava Kava, St. John's Wort, etc.  Similar to but variant from Ragga Dagga.
* Certainly safer than pharmaceuticals!
* Many fine ganja virtues with none of the negatives!
* Better sleeping ... better dreaming.
* Non-invasive ... no downside.
* An exquisite compliment with Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (tm) -- (See Intro Offers)
* Quite simply ... it is a Superior product!Contents: Aqueous Kathmandu is a unique botanical substantiality.  It is offered and marketed as such.  Undisputedly, it achieves ""distinctive accolade"" of its own merit....  Aqueous Kathmandu is absolutely legal and does not contain any controlled or regulated or harmful herbs or cannabis factors.  However, it is our mandatory ethical policy that Aqueous Kathmandu not be offered to individuals who have not yet attained at least 21 years of age (all things in their time....).  Please note as well that Aqueous Kathmandu is not intended for usage during work or while driving.  And, as is true of all substance and indulgence, this product should not be enjoyed during pregnancy.  This proprietary formulation does include the following quantum-ratio, core-extracted/refined botanicals in an alcohol base as a preservative: Albizzia flower-tops, Drachsha, Chavana Prash, Lactuca Virosa, Hybrid Flowering Turnera Diffusa, Wild Dagga, Capillaris Herba, Angelica Root, Zizyphi Spinosae, Buplerum, Hybrid Valeriana officinalis Root, Albizzia flower-tops, mature Polygonum Vine, Calea Zacatechichi, Crocus Sativa flower-tops, Leonorus Sibricus buds, Cinnabaris, Margarita herba, Biotae Orientalis, Salviae Miltiorrhizae....

STONEY MAHONEY
**************************In regard to the introduction of Stoney Mahoney (tm) ""personal choice"" smoking substantiality product, we have strived for years to develop a consummate ""Sensitive/Responsive"" (loose-leaf) smoking product, ""Amsterdam Cup"" style so to speak!With acquired knowledge via the development of such notable ""personal choice"" smokeables, as Wizard Smoke (tm), Dream Smoke (tm), Dragon Smoke (tm), Vajroli Mudra (tm), Stashish (tm), ShemHampHorash (tm), Yerba lena Yesca (tm), WeedÃ© (tm), Kathmandu Temple Kiff (tm) 1 & 2 & 3, which for the most part have been proprietary formulations, of which the rights have been sold to other less aggressive, less developmental companies, we arrived at the lofty ""personal choice"" smoking status of our premier Ragga Dagga (tm) solid pipe-smoking product.  After all of this, we had come to the technological and philosophical point of view that we could not conjure a loose-leaf formulation that would provide effectuality that would be more significant than that of our much-heralded Ragga Dagga (tm) solid-format pipe smoking product.  Mostly, we were right about this, as this new Stoney Mahoney ""agenda"" is not so much significant as in ""better"", but ""Signature Significant"" as in ""uniqueness,"" in that we chanced upon a new world class, botanical source for the rare ""true-brid"" variety of Artemisia absinthum (flowering tops only), which at one time in history was distilled into ""Absinthe,"" a greenish, aniseed flavored liqueur which heralded certain euphoric and narcotic attributes which ultimately resulted in it being declared illegal.  As well, we have finally perfected our exclusive ""kiffening"" technique, which inspires and establishes alkaloid and glycoside potentiation (enhancement) on a molecular level.  Hence, we introduce (although supply is limited) this highly ""potentiated"" Stoney Mahoney (tm) smoking product! Loose-leaf ""personal choice"" doesnâ€™t get any ""sweeter"" than this!  And for all of you Ragga Dagga fans, please note that, indeed, it isnâ€™t so much that Stoney Mahoney loose-leaf is more viripotent than the Ragga Dagga solid-format.  Moreover, it is that Stoney Mahoney is effective in a much different way than Ragga Dagga.  Sort of like apples and oranges, like Panamanian and Jamaican, like Indica and Sativa, if you will!  Within our test marketing, even traditional ""Kind Bud"" aficionados have magnanimously acclaimed this Stoney Mahoney jester variety.  Most folks say that Ragga Dagga motivates them in an up ""Sativa"" sort of way, and that Stoney Mahoney mellows them out or giggles them out in a ""soma,"" Indica sort of way.  If Stoney Mahoney has any shortcoming at all, it is quite simply that due to the extreme ""kiffening"" of this product, it may be to the uninitiated practitioner, a harsh draw.  It is for this reason that in addition to the inclusion of a standard herb pipe and package of rolling papers, we also include a brass, personal water-pipe (hookah).  As is true for many high-minded folks, a water-pipe filled with chilled water or wine will temperament the demonstrativeness of Stoney Mahoneyâ€™s draw.  * Indica oriented.
* Definitely happy smoking!
* Mood enhancer.
* Smokeable & brewable mood food!
* Good-bye stress, anxiety, & restlessness.
* Sleep deep -- Good-bye funky dreams!
* Hornier than horny goatweed!
* Superlative mixer with Ragga Dagga and/or Aqueous Kathmandu.
* Roll it or bowl it or brew it ...
* Just a pinch goes a long, long way ...
* Possesses many fine ganja virtues with none of the negatives.
* Non-invasive.
* Absolutely Legal!
* Rolling papers, herb pipe & personal brass water pipe (hookah)are included.Attention! Attention! We have, by popular demand and in the interest of good economics, created an introductory offer that features both Ragga Dagga and Stoney Mahoney products and, also, still another introductory offer which includes Ragga Dagga, Stoney Mahoney and, for you non-smokers, our Aqueous Kathmandu Happiness Drops (these are pretty special!).  And to mention furthermore, for non-smokers, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) loose-leaf product is also a brewable delight.  A tea for theeâ€¦.)Please Note:  Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is an absolutely legal, herba/botanical, ""Personal Choice,"" loose-leaf substantiality smoking product!  No included botanical factor therein is regulated by law or considered to be harmful by regulatory agencies.  There is no tobacco in Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm).  There is certainly no cannabis/marijuana in Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm).  And although we are not age-governed by law, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is intended exclusively for sophisticated adult usage! Subsequently, it is our MANDATORY ethical policy that Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) may not be sold, offered, or given to any person that has not attained at least twenty-one years of age.  As well, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving.  It should not be enjoyed during pregnancy nor is it intended to supercede physician's care in any regard.Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm), factored in an Absinthium Labyrinthine Configuration, is an exclusive, kiffened, loose-leaf, primo modino, ""Sensitive/Responsive,"" Smoking and/or Brewing Herba which may be, depending upon preference, rolled or bowled or brewed.As is an herbalistâ€™s way, three or four draws of Smoke should be inhaled and retained.  For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herba as a potentiated tea/brew.  (Steep approximately one tea-spoon of Stoney Mahoney herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.)  When smoking Stoney Mahoney, please draw gently as Stoney Mahoney is a most preeminent ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Smoke and may be considered to be a harsh draw to the uninitiated practitioner.  (Water-pipe is included with each package of Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety).)Stoney Mahoney contains and is kiffened with the following exotica botanicals and botanical extracts & essences: Dutch Lactuca virosa, Bulgarian Artemisia absinthum (flowering-tops only), Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Chinese Valeriana ceae, Jamaican Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus boldo, and European (flowering-tops only) Sarothamnus Scoparius. Stoney Mahoney does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Stoney Mahoney does indeed achieve distinction upon its own merit....*************************************************

( pwc ) was engaged in 10 / 00 to develop a business plan for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical business . in 11 / 00 , aa was engaged to develop a "" blueprint "" of eim major processes ( deal execution , deal capture , risk management , logistics , settlements and financial reporting ) , down to level 2 processes . the initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the "" blueprint "" , a gap analysis of enron systems to business needs and recommended systems . a complete "" roadmap "" should be laid out with a 0 - 3 months , 4 - 6 months , 7 - 9 months and 10 - 12 months timeline . the plan addresses tactical also . our overall objective : build an infrastructure ( people , processes and systems ) that is scalable and supports the trading business of eim . the current industries are forest products and steel . however , additional industries may be added . the targeted infrastructure would require little change to support new industries . the delieverable is expected by the end of 2 / 01 . we ' d be happy to visit with you all ( video conference or houston , . . . . ) to give you more information . let me know how to proceed . thanks again for your time . since i wasn ' t able to attend the controllers ' conference last 10 / 00 , i ' m glad i got to meet you last week . stay in touch . brenda to : brenda f herod / hou / ect @ ect cc : mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , paul wallace / lon / ect @ ect subject : metals brenda as discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality between enron metals and eim that should allow leverage off common goals . in particular i promised info on a few areas : project q assessment a lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to enron metals ( being to do with interfaces with our as 400 ysstem ) however high level issues which formed part of the decision to not develop this for enron metals were : q is over specified for metals . traffic / logistics for metals is less complex than oil & coal . metals process tends towards buy > store > sell whereas for liquids the storage is not as prevelant metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship / barge 2 . inventory controls again the reports produced here have been very specific to enron metals . paul wallace a manager in the co - ordination function is working extensively on developing the controls in this area . i would suggest that you contact paul directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in general . 3 . funding of inventory we have a structured finance facility here in london . the deal is specific to enron metals markets in that it works by reference to lme prices as these are the base index for all the positions placed in the facility . if structured financing is sort for eim then it would be appropriate to talk to either david tregar ( metals commercial ) or bill appleby ( global finance ) as an intro to the issues faced . 4 . curve management process the markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the lme curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and location . given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by brand group and port location . e . g . for copper this means we have a grid with 5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups ( 13 for europe , 7 for the us and 6 for the far east ) . the maintaince & price testing of the grids is made manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points i . e . price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a market quote . 5 . re recruitment of paper traders i haven ' t been able to contact him but i recall that the brother of david rosenblum , one of the metals traders in chicago , is a trader of recylced paper . i ' ll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in london . i ' d appreciate same for eim . regards andy",Safe Email

CNET's Tech index rose 14.46 points, or 1.41 percent, to 1,007.37, and the tech-laced Nasdaq composite index tacked on 21.97 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,397.23.With aircraft maker Boeing beating the consensus Wall Street earnings estimate, the Dow Jones industrials increased 69.37 points, or 0.82 percent, to 8,542.48. The S&P 500 rose 5.08 points, or 0.56 percent, to 906.02.
Motorola Sees Profit Rebound 
CHICAGO - Wireless technology giant Motorola Inc. on Wednesday said it expects to bounce back to a net profit in the third and fourth quarters helped by aggressive cost cutting.Motorola, a day after posting the largest quarterly loss in its history, said it expects to achieve earnings of about 2 cents a share in the third quarter and 10 cents in the fourth quarter. The estimated earnings for the second half of the year includes charges of about $215 million related to previously announced restructuring actions.The world's second largest mobile phone maker has slashed its work force by more than a third from its peak of 150,000 in August 2000. It said last month it would cut another 7,000 jobs, bringing employment to 93,000 by mid-2003.MOTOROLA, INC 15.15 4.27% Apple meets lowered expectations 
Apple Computer on Tuesday reported quarterly sales and earnings that matched analysts' lowered expectations as flat-panel iMac sales and sales to schools fell short of the company's initial hopes.
The company earned $32 million, or 9 cents per share, on revenue of $1.43 billion. In the same quarter a year ago, Apple earned $61 million, or 17 cents per share, on revenue of $1.48 billionAnalysts expected Apple to report earnings of 9 cents per share, according to First Call. Apple warned last month that sales would be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, down from an earlier estimate of $1.6 billion. The company said it expected earnings to be between 8 and 10 cents per share.APPLE COMPUTER INC 15.63 -12.49% HP, EMC storage systems to work better together

"california update 4 / 9 / 01 here is what we know so far with the recent announcement of a deal between socal and the state for the transmission lines : ? the deal may be enough to save socal from bankruptcy . this will depend on the payment terms as well as how soon socal can receive a positive cash flow . ? we are not sure if the state can really do a deal without pg & e or a deal for whole grid . it was thought that a transmission asset deal was not possible without pg the state may still be making the deal contingent upon the purchasing of pg & e ' s assets . a generator source reports that the state is intending to put pressure on the bankruptcy court to close the deal on pg & e ' s lines quickly . however , bankruptcy courts usually do not operate in this manner . in most cases the court would have to hold open proceedings , have competitive bids , etc . ? this purchase would need legislative approval , which is not guaranteed . previously the plan was for the state to purchase sce ' s and pg & e ' s assets at a premium so that they would not have to finance power purchases - the utilities would be able to buy power for themselves . now they would have to purchase sce ' s lines , but still finance power purchases because of pg & e . additionally , it is possible that socal swapped the clause allowing then to raise rates in order to recoup past debt in favor for an additional book price . if this any form of a utility bailout - it would probably no gain legislative approval . ? the purchase would also need ferc approval . as stated before , if ferc approves such a plan it would be with several conditions for california .",Safe Email

"sexism and language re lydie e . meunier 's latest , i did not mean to say that i consider oppression of any kind to be of no importance , but merely that in studying linguistic usages it is of no importance ( or at least less importance , ok ? ) what the real situation re oppression and the like is than what people perceive it to be . if ( as some seem to believe ) there is no oppression of women by men , i meant to say , that would not be what we would want to know in order to explain sexist language , so long as people believe that men are better , stronger , or whatever , so long as people believe that men are and deserve to be dominant and / or more prominent in public life , etc . because even if these things were not true ( although i think by large they obviously are ) , so long as people believe they are ( and certainly all cultures i am familiar with do ) , then that would suffice to explain sexist language . in the same way , we as linguists need not discuss the existence of god in order to be able to say that certain linguistic usages seem to be derived from such a belief . so , yes , i do believe women have been and continue to be oppressed in various ways , i am astounded that there are people who would deny it , but i also would say that in order to explain sexist language , that is not what we need to discuss . alexis manaster ramer",Safe Email

"origination meeting louise : i unfortunately was not able to attend your meeting this morning as i was interviewing analyst candidates , however the overall reaction from the group seems to be positive and i applaud you for your efforts in setting the tone . i realize the company is in an interesting position with respect to liquidity and therefore i felt compelled to pass this thought by you with respect to a potential avenue power origination could pursue to assist with the current situation . since most of our activities seem to require some amount of capital , i was wondering whether you felt a viable strategy would be to turn carl tricoli ' s prepay concept for ipp ' s on its head and reverse the transaction with one or more counterparties where we pick up the upfront premium and deliver power in the future . assuming we can find the right counterparties , then we in essence would achieve a short position ( which seems to be more in line with your strategic thoughts ) and pick up liquidity in the short run . regards , charlie",Safe Email

"                   Welcome to ""Ghetto"" America!
ï¿½...Yes, you heard me; I said ""Ghetto"" America! What is ""Ghetto"" 
America, I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned, 
this explanation may not sit well with many of you, however it is 
no less true! ""Ghetto"" America is a society of individuals 
comprised primarily of African Americans who represent the 
impoverished, and often unpolished side of ""Black America;"" 
Confused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a 
typical ghetto community; namely the ""projects"" and noticed an 
unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular 
neighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have 
been to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young 
""teen looking"" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby 
carriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also 
noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying 
them. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the 
absence of the all important ""wedding band"" missing from their 
respective ring fingers!"" .And of course we have all heard 
stories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly 
mugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know 
that many young African American women refuse to date African 
American males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In 
fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who 
represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as 
""Thugs"" or ""Street Hustlers;"" Also, did you know that many young 
African American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while 
living in government housing better known as the ""projects"" 
rather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make 
investments?
 
    ""Attention"" This is Not another ""Boyz in the Hood"" Story!
 
These newly distinguished ""Black Generation Xers"" are suffering 
through utter chaos. ""Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare 
Abusers...Images of My America"" is a collection of observations, 
and commentary as told through the eyes of a young African 
American Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths 
that many in ""Black America,"" and the world in general would have 
you believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds 
light on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of 
""Mainstream American Society."" A society that has nurtured the 
rampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many 
young African American men, and women currently suffer from. The 
writer supports his arguments with direct references to the 
overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to 
raise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish 
criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes 
being based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or 
cool neighborhood reputation.
 
The author also identifies the self-destructive and often 
criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily 
basis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, 
robbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing 
expensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior 
committed by both males, and females is due in large part to a 
lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless 
homes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with 
the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in 
the form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations 
are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack 
of direction that currently exists in young ""Black America"" 
today. To learn more about this dynamic self contained society

Date: 2002-10-08T20:52:08-05:00Movable Type 2.5 is out. I'm running it and it appears to work. It incorporates 
many suggestions from Dive Into Accessibility[1], a book which was written in 
and is still powered by Movable Type. I find this amusing in a self-referential 
sort of way. The other big change is the inclusion of MT-search to allow users to have their 
own site search. Every web site needs a site search[2]. Existing MT-search 
users should merge the contents of mt-search.cfg into mt.cfg, change 
""TemplateDir"" to ""SearchTemplatePath"", and (if you use alternate templates) 
change ""AltTemplate1"", ""AltTemplate2"", ""AltTemplate3"", etc. to ""AltTemplate"". 
They should all just be ""AltTemplate"". - Download MT 2.5[3].

"toc for linguist list dear sirs , prof . helen dry has offered that we might include announcements of our activities in linguist ( message of 24 april 97 ) . you will find the announcement of a workshop on reported speech below . thank you in advance . manfred roncador announcement of a workshop at the ' 20th conference of the german linguistic society ( dgfs ) ' in halle on ' form and function of reported speech ' coordinators : tom gueldemann and manfred von roncador linguistic studies have increasingly demonstrated that in contrast to the traditional approach a clear-cut distinction between direct and indirect speech is for many languages untenable . the existence of such intermediate forms as semi-direct speech , so-called style indirect libre ( free indirect discourse ) , and logophoric constructions point rather to an analysis whereby the different forms of reported speech are assigned a specific position on a continuum whose extreme poles are characterized by a minimal or maximal shift of the deictic centre ( cf . roncador 1988 ) . in the framework of such a theoretical approach , it is interesting to investigate which different functions the individual forms of reported speech may serve in discourse . another interesting question concerns the grammatical characteristics of quotative constructions ( qc ) , i . e . linguistic expressions used in languages to signal reported speech , and how these qcs are related to the functions of the different categories of reported speech laid out on the continuum mentioned just above . possible features to be investigated in this respect are inter alia the internal structure of qcs , the obligatoriness of the individual propositional elements in them ( such as reference to speaker and addressee ) , the particular strategy for expressing the locutionary aspect , and the nature of the semanto-syntactic relation between qc and the quote itself . the historical processes that qcs or their elements are subject to constitute another possible focus of attention . this is meant to include the discussion on grammaticalization processes in this domain , which is already quite extensive but which has probably focused too much on the development of speech verbs only . as analyses of reported speech in single languages are often still oriented towards concepts developed for european languages , contributions on non - european languages offering new insights on less-known aspects of this functional domain will be particularly welcome . this will serve to put these first attempts to typologize the phenomenon of reported speech in its functional and formal aspects ( cf . roeck 1994 ) on a broader empirical basis . references : roeck , m . de . 1994 . typology of speech reports . in : engberg - pedersen et al .

"summary : negated questions and exclamations about two weeks ago , i posted a query on two subjects : i was looking for languages ( 1 ) which can or , on the contrary , cannot use negated interrogatives like "" look , over there - is n't that john ? "" in order to express a positive expectation , and ( 2 ) which have negated wh-exclamations like german : "" was du nicht alles weisst ! "" ( lit . : ' what you do n't know all ! ' ) or serbocroatian "" sta nije sve doziveo ! "" ( lit . : ' what he did n't all live through ! ' ) , that refer to the positive , not the negative fact . first of all , i wish to thank the following colleagues for their contributions : suzanne albrecht ( sanabria @ zedat . fu-berlin . de ) gisle andersen ( henga @ alf . uib . no ) birgitta englund dimitrova ( birgitta . englund @ tolk . su . se ) frederik fouvry ( fouvry @ llsun4 . essex . ac . uk ) keith goeringer ( keg @ violet . berkeley . edu ) michael israel ( israel @ ling . ucsd . edu ) dalina kallulli ( dalina . kallulli @ avh . unit . no ) jussi karlgren ( jussi @ sics . se ) e . h . klein - v . d . laaken ( klein @ let . rug . nl ) james kirchner ( jpkirchner @ aol . com ) randy lapolla ( hslapolla @ ccvax . sinica . edu . tw ) pierre larrivee ( aaa552 @ agora . ulaval . ca ) bert peeters ( bert . peeters @ modlang . utas . edu . au ) francisco raga ( raga @ vents . uji . es ) alexandr rosen ( alexandr . rosen @ ff . cuni . cz ) cristina sanz ( sanzc @ gusun . acc . georgetown . edu ) karen stanley ( karen _ stanley @ cpcc . cc . nc . us ) jan vorster ( vorsterj @ mtb . und . ac . za ) ton van der wouden ( vdwouden @ let . rug . nl ) deborah yeager ( kyeager @ prism . nmt . edu ) ning zhang ( zning @ epas . utoronto . ca ) the languages i received information about were : afrikaans , albanian , catalan , chinese , czech , english , dutch , norwegean , spanish , swedish , yucatec maya . no additional languages have been named where the use of negated questions like "" look , over there - is n't that john ? "" was not possible ; so apache and navajo are still the only examples i have found so far . . as to the negated wh-exclamations , what is most interesting is that they do exist in languages where the native speakers i had asked so far had been convinced that they do not . examples for this are english and spanish , cf . : what i did n't do to get that report finished on time ! ( karen stanley ) cuanto no tendre que sufrir hasta conseguirlo ! ( cristina sanz ) this type of construction can obviously be found in much more languages than i had assumed . in some of them , it seems to be old fashened and not very wide spread , but it still exists as such .

"Hi XFS developers,
When studying xfs code(2.4.19), I found that the inode will be locked by 
XFS_ILOCK_SHARE flags before we get acl, which may cause deadlock.
Because when getting acl, it will allocate memory in KM_SLEEP, If the 
memory is tight, the process will call xfs_strategy, and may 
lock(XFS_ILOCK_SHARE)the same inode again. If between these two locks, 
another process try to lock the inode by XFS_ILOCK_EXCL, these two 
processes  will be deadlock. As follows,    A process get ea                         B process want lock ipA1) xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_SHARE)             .....................

"alliance info alert ferc acts to remove obstacles to address western energy crisis * * omnibus order mobilizes ferc ' s entire energy pricing and infrastructure authority * * to adopt financial incentives for capacity increases in transmission facilities * * streamlines regulation of wholesale market , energy facilities siting and licensing * * promotes conservation and wholesale side of demand - response bidding * * order doesn ' t address price caps * * meeting with western state regulators / officials set for april 6 , 2001 in boise , idaho ferc moves to bring more economic and reliable energy supplies to the stressed california and western energy markets . ferc proposes to increase bulk power supply in the west by removing barriers and providing incentives that are within its jurisdiction over facility certification , licensing , and the regulation of transmission and wholesale power sales in interstate commerce . ferc quickly wants to increase electric generation and transmission capacity , as well as to streamline the regulation of wholesale power transactions , as well as increase the capacity of the supporting infrastructure of natural gas and oil pipelines . the order , which sets new precedent in its broadness , also proposes actions to reduce electricity demand in the west as well as promoting the necessary wholesale - market portion of demand - response bidding where states wish to implement the retail side . ferc asks for comments on additional actions it may take in the future by march 30 , 2001 . effective immediately , ferc said in a statement , * the commission is streamlining regulatory procedures for wholesale electric power sales , expediting the certification of natural gas pipeline projects into california and the west , including the reallocation of staff resources to more quickly address pending pipeline applications , and urging all licensees to review their ferc - licensed hydroelectric projects in order to assess the potential for increased generating capacity . * among the actions ferc takes are to : 1 ) require the california iso and transmission owners within all 11 states of the western systems coordinating council ( wscc ) to prepare a list of grid enhancements that can be completed in the short term ; 2 ) waive prior notice requirements for any on - site or self - generators that sell at wholesale within the wscc area ; 3 ) grant blanket market - based rate authority for sales on the wholesale market of electric energy that becomes available as a result of demand - response reductions in retail and wholesale loads ; and 4 ) broadening and extending through december 31 , 2001 the temporary waivers of the operating and efficiency standards for qualifying facilities ( qfs ) to increase the availability of generating capacity . ferc seeks comments by march 30 on a series of economic incentives aimed at ensuring timely upgrades to the western transmission grid , including an increased rate of return on equity ( roe ) for projects that significantly increase transmission and can be in service by either june 1 , 2001 , or november 1 , 2001 . other areas that ferc requested comment on include the use of interconnection authority under the federal power act , and to raise the dollar limits on the issuance of blanket certificates authorizing gas pipeline construction . on hydro issues , ferc requested comment on ways to increase operating flexibility at ferc - licensed projects while protecting environmental resources . in its effort to encourage investment in transmission infrastructure , ferc asked for comments - again by march 30 - on a series of economic incentives aimed at ensuring upgrades to the western interconnection , including the increased roe for projects that significantly increase transmission on constrained paths and can be in service by the above dates in 2001 . increased roe , ferc said , will also be given to system upgrades over new transmission paths that can be in service by june 1 , 2002 , or november 1 , 2002 . ferc seeks comment on a proposed 10 - year depreciation period for projects that increase transmission capacity in the short - term and a 15 - year depreciation period for upgrades involving new rights - of - way that can be of service by november 1 , 2002 . in his dissent to the order , commissioner massey argued the order focuses on "" quick fixes , "" and that the measures will not close the gap between supply in demand in california . the order also "" fails to address price relief , "" noted massey . massey also called for a full federal power act ( fpa ) section 206 investigation of california issues , which would allow for the possibility of refunds . on transmission incentive provisions , massey lamented that the proposed roe increase to 14 percent appeared arbitrary and inconsistent with ferc policy under order no . 2000 . the financial provisions , he said , appeared to be "" just throwing money at the problem . "" while generally disappointed with the order , massey did express limited support for many parts of the order . many of the suggestions in the order are the "" same actions as authorized last may , "" said massey . "" they were good ideas then , and they are good ideas now , "" he concluded . for his part in comments at the open meeting when the order was adopted , chairman hebert said the order was designed to "" squeeze every additional mw of supply available "" and to encourage the conservation of mw , and stressed that ferc is "" doing all it can in its power to alleviate western problems . "" he said the order seeks to eradicate the projected supply shortfall in california , but noted that generation / transmission siting , and conservation are generally state issues . ferc ' s * removing obstacles * order is posted on its web site at : citation : ferc issued is order removing obstacles to increased electric generation and natural gas supply in the western united states and asking for comments was issued on march 14 , 2001 , docket no . elol - 47 - 000 . a detailed analysis and summary of the specific actions taken and proposals made follows : electric transmission infrastructure within 30 days , the california iso and transmission owners in wscc are to prepare and file for information purposes a list of grid enhancement projects that may be underway or may not require initial siting and acquisition of rights of way . ferc proposes a scaled transmission infrastructure incentive under which transmission owners of projects that increase transmission capacity at present constraints and can be in service by july 1 , 2001 would receive a cost - based rate reflecting a 300 basis point premium return on equity and a 10 - year depreciable life . projects in service by november 1 , 2001 , would get a 200 basis point premium and 10 - year depreciable life . ferc would use a uniform baseline return on equity for all jurisdictional transmission providers in wscc of 11 . 5 % , based on the roe ferc approved for southern california edison . system upgrades that involve new rights of way , add significant transfer capability and can be in service by november 1 , 2002 , would get a cost - based rate reflecting 12 . 5 % roe , or al 00 basis point premium , and 15 - year depreciable life . facilities needed to interconnect new supply to the grid , which go into service as required to accommodate the in - service date of the new plant would get a cost - based rate that reflected a 13 . 5 % roe , or a 200 basis point premium , if in service by november 1 , 2001 and 12 . 5 % roe if in service by november 1 , 2002 . for increases in transmission capacity on constrained interfaces that do not involve significant capital investments , for example , installing new technology , ferc proposes to allow transmission owners to increase the revenue requirement of their network service rates to ensure that each additional mw of capacity will generate revenues equal to their current firm point - to - point rate . ferc requests comment on whether to assign the cost of any interconnection or system upgrade to a particular load or supply , or alternatively , to roll these costs into the average system rate . extension of waivers for qfs ferc proposes to extend its temporary waivers of operating and efficiency standards for qfs - applicable throughout wscc - to allow increased generation through december 31 , 2001 . the waivers were to expire on april 30 , 2001 . the proposed waiver would allow qualifying cogenerators to sell their output above the level at which they have historically supplied this output to purchasing utility . the waiver for qualifying small power production facilities in wscc with respect to their fuel use requirements under ferc regulation section 292 . 204 ( b ) , would be extended to december 31 , 2001 . additional capacity from on - site generation ferc will adopt streamlined regulatory procedure to accommodate wholesale sales from such facilities that serve load within wscc . through december 31 , 2001 , owners of generating facilities located at business locations in wscc and used primarily for back - up or self - generation who would become subject to fpa by virtue of sales of such power will be permitted to sell power at wholesale without prior notice under fpa section 205 . ferc also authorizes such power to be sold at market - based rates . ferc waives its prior notice requirement for mutually agreed upon interconnection agreements for interconnections necessary to accomplish these sales . quarterly reporting is required . allows demand response bidding ferc will allow retail customers , as permitted by state law , and wholesale customers to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load reduction at wholesale . ferc is granting blanket authorization , consistent with its prior discussion on sales from on - site generation and requires similar reporting . ferc ' s december 15 order on the california market directed , as a longer - term measure that the iso pursue establishing an integrated day - ahead market in which all demand and supply bids are addressed in one venue . ferc seeks comments on the desirability of accelerating action on this . ferc says it realizes that states play an important role in regulating retail electric service and that allowing retail load to reduce consumption for resale in wholesale markets raises legal , commercial , technical and regulatory issues . safeguards may be needed to protect and enhance retail demand - response bidding programs . intention is not to undermine state programs but to promote the necessary complementary wholesale programs . requests comments on how helpful this action is and how it can be accomplished consistent with state jurisdiction over retail sales . contract modifications for demand - response bidding there may be opportunities for public utilities to make other types of demand - response arrangements with their wholesale customers . as for mutually agreeable qf interconnections , ferc will waive prior notice requirement for any mutually agreeable demand - response related rate schedule amendments that may be required to effectuate these arrangements . clarifies that demand - response program costs should be treated consistently with all other types of incremental and out - of - pocket costs . interconnections fpa section 210 ( d ) allows ferc to issue an order requiring interconnection if it makes a finding that such an order : 1 ) is in the public interest ; 2 ) would encourage overall conservation of energy or capital , optimize the efficiency of use of facilities and resources , or improve the reliability of any electric utility system or federal power marketing agency to which the order applies ; and 3 ) meets the requirements of fpa section 212 . ferc requests comments on whether it can use this authority under fpa section 210 ( d ) to alleviate existing impediments to electricity reaching load . if the exercise of this authority may be warranted , ferc seeks comments on whether it could make some of the required findings generically for the wscc region in order to respond quickly should circumstances arise requiring immediate action . longer term regional solutions ferc believes an rto for the entire western region or the seamless integration of western rtos is the best vehicle for designing and implementing a long - term regional solution . natural gas pipeline capacity ferc has realigned its resources to respond to new applications for gas pipeline capacity and is soliciting comments on ways to expedite the approval of pipeline infrastructure needed to serve california and the west . requests comments on how it might further exercise its authority over new pipeline construction to alleviate the present crisis , including increasing the dollar limit thresholds for blanket certificates to $ 10 million , and for prior notice authorizations to $ 30 million in order to increase the facilities qualifying for automatic authorization ; offering blanket certificates for construction or acquisition of portable compressor stations to enhance pipeline capacity to california ; and offering rate incentives to expedite construction of projects that will make additional capacity available this summer on constrained pipeline systems . hydroelectric power ferc staff will hold a conference to discuss methods to address environmental protection at hydro projects while allowing increased generation . requests comments on ways to allow for greater operating flexibility at commission - licensed hydro projects while protecting environmental resources . comments should consider : 1 ) methods for agency involvement ; 2 ) ways to handle and expedite endangered species act consultations ; 3 ) criteria for modifying licenses ; and 4 ) identification of processes that could be implemented to provide efficiency upgrades . oil pipelines ferc will explore with oil pipelines innovative proposals that could lead to ensuring an adequate flow of petroleum product into the california market . conference with state commissioners ferc will hold a one - day conference with state commissioners and other state representatives from western states to discuss price volatility in the west as well as other ferc - related issues identified by the governors of western states . by notice issued march 16 , this meeting is scheduled for april 6 , 2001 in boise , idaho .

"a theory of predicates a theory of predicates ackerman , farrell ( university of california , san diego ) and webelhuth , gert ( university of north carolina , chapel hill ) ; a theory of predicates ; isbn : 1-57586 - 087 - 2 ( cloth ) , 1-57586 - 086 - 4 ( paper ) ; 402 pp . csli publications 1998 : http : / / csli-www . stanford . edu / publications / email : pubs @ roslin . stanford . edu in this work two linguists from different theoretical paradigms develop a new general theory of natural language predicates . this theory is capable of addressing a broad range of issues concerning ( complex ) predicates , many of which remain unresolved in previous theoretical proposals . grounded in empirical evidence from a wide variety of genetically and geographically unrelated languages ( german , hungarian , fox , nenets , tzotzil , malayalam , among others ) , this new theory synthesizes conceptual and representational assumptions from several different theoretical traditions . the authors focus on cross-linguistically recurring patterns of predicate formation where identical contentive notions ( i . e . , lexical semantic , grammatical function , and morphosyntactic information ) are expressed by predicates consisting of a single morphological word or by combinations of independent words that need not form a single syntactic unit . they provide a detailed implementation of their theory for german tense-aspect , passive , causative , and verb-particle predicates . in addition , the authors discuss extensions of these representative analyses to the same predicate constructions in other languages . beyond providing a formalism for the analysis of language-particular predicates , they demonstrate how the basic theoretical mechanisms they develop can be employed to explain universal tendencies of predicate formation . for this purpose , ackerman and webelhuth introduce the construct ` grammatical archetype ' into linguistic theory , relating universal patterns of predicate formation to language-particular patterns in a principled fashion . this book will be of interest to linguists and grammarians from any generative , cognitive / functional , or traditional perspective . in addition , it is accessible to interested philosophers , psycholinguists , cognitive scientists , computational linguists , anthropological linguists , and philologists . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * csli publications ventura hall stanford university stanford , ca 94305-4115 telephone ( 650 ) 723-1839 fax ( 650 ) 725-2166 http : / / csli-www . stanford . edu / publications",Safe Email

"commoditylogic . com mike , further to our conversation , here are some of the things i thought of while speaking with tom gros . there are definitely some challenges we have to overcome to make the hub idea within commoditylogic . com as successful as enrononline rather than have it turn out like sitara . i won ' t repeat thoughts about how we split cl from enron , but let ' s put ourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as a potential solution . well , that ' s an easy decision , somebody else is doing the hard work , and not charging us very much for it . so sign - up , but don ' t rely on anything until we see everything working . handling counterparties not using the system the challenge here is that the final solution world with overybody using the hub is wonderful , but until everybody is using the hub , we have to keep other procedures and systems going , which stretches resources , development , it support and user . this was why we decided to delay getting bolero - the concept is wonderful , but the value to any user is very dependent on everyone else one trades with using the system . this is classic chicken and egg . tom has a vision of cl providing the staff to handle this . this is taking us closer to an outsource - to - andersen - consulting model which is certainly achievable , although not quite such an easy sell . how much resource is left the latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people , who are therefore not available for keeping everything else going and moving onwards . how about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to cl , and then review what is left in the remaining environment . does it mean we hold off doing anything ? if we do then increasing volume means that we might end up incurring costs for massive numbers of people ! we should go through costing for "" what happens if we completely stop development of x project ? "" . if that shows one would need 200 clerks for 3 years until something else comes along then it may be cheaper than developing , but i hope in most cases it is not ! start small to prove concept e . g . first application in april 2001 only covers 20 fields this is excellent , and we needn ' t shout it too loud to investors in cl , but for our internal back office costing we need to acknowledge that it will be years before we can switch off many internal systems . we might limit the payback period on projects not part of this strategy to 3 years out ? include european aspects from the beginning this really isn ' t very difficult so long as one has some long - on - common - sense europeans ( not just brits ) involved in both specification and development from the beginning , but an as example of how not to do it , look at enpower which took a year to allow just for currencies etc ! 80 - 20 rule for types of transaction eol has shown the benefits of focussing on simpler products first . once we have robust warehouses for collecting accounting ( dtl ) and risk ( risktrac ? ) numbers then we can think about having vanilla products on stp , and yet - to - become - vanilla products on explicitly different , manual approaches . until that time , we have a strong desire to include as many different prodcuts as possible for a given commodity in one system , which makes separating vanillas from others more complicated and costly ( think of certain deals in power 99 which are approximations of the actual deals , and manually tweaked every so often ) testing tom ' s first thought is that we could leverage initial users ( who would not pay ) to do much of the testing . eol clearly got its testing done , but other experience shows that in order to have anything which saves time one really does need to do all the different phases - component , system , integration , end - to - end , and then user - acceptance . eol saw confidentiality as an issue and was therefore unable to use many external users early in the process . it did have massive resource - commandability and so obtained input from many traders . do the support functions have sufficient slack that they will be able to provide the same sort of user attention ? given how often i hear "" short people "" , that strikes me as something which in london would require significant additional resource , even after mg is absorbed . what else did you come up with ? richard",Safe Email

"Last week I had a chance to see some TabletPC's demonstrated, and I was very
impressed.* Handwriting recognition was good, as was the ability to parse text from
diagrammatic or graphic elements.
* TabletPC form factors, while not perfect, are quite usable (light,
relatively thin, some can convert from laptop to tablet use by flipping the
screen).
* Pushbutton switching between portrait and landscape screen orientation.
* TabletPCs I saw came with built-in WiFi.
* Good to very good integration of handwriting into existing applications,
and there is a very nice new note-taking application specifically for
handwritten notes.
* Good set of APIs for adding handwriting into existing applications (at the
most simple, it's only a few additional lines of code)
* Prices of the hardware will be around mid-range laptop (will vary by
model)I believe the TabletPC will be very successful, and is a much bigger deal
than the relative lack of press coverage would suggest. I'm definitely
starting to think about how I could incorporate one into my routine...- Jim

"In 1957, a monastery in Thailand was being relocated and a group of monks
was put in charge of moving a giant clay Buddha. In the midst of the move
one of the monks noticed a crack in the Buddha. Concerned about damaging the
idol, the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task.
When night came, one of the monks came to check on the giant statue. He
shined his flashlight over the entire Buddha. When he reached the crack he
saw something reflected back at him. The monk, his curiosity aroused, got a
hammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay Buddha. As he
knocked off piece after piece of clay, the Buddha got brighter and brighter.
After hours of work, the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before
him a huge solid-gold Buddha.Many historians believe the Buddha had been covered with clay by Thai monks
several hundred years earlier before an attack by the Burmese army. They
covered the Buddha to keep it from being stolen. In the attack all the monks
were killed, so it wasn't until 1957, when the monks were moving the giant
statue, that the great treasure was discovered. Like the Buddha, our outer
shell protects us from the word: our real treasure is hidden within. We
human beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay. All we
need to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our
outer shell, piece by piece.Could you be sitting on your own gold mine? Did you know the average
American can retire a millionaire on his or her current income? Then, why
don't they? It's simple. They haven't been taught that they could. They are
taught to use debt to get what they want now instead of having their money
work for them. They pay too much in taxes. They are wasting money every
month and don't even realize it. In short, they are financially unhealthy.

of clueless oversimplication that led to the blackouts.  There are a
bazillion factors that affect game strategies, which is what the state of
California messed up and the energy producers exploited.I'm not convinced that the only way to prevent future energy debacles like
the blackouts is to reregulate.  Ultimately we have to blame the people
who crafted the game rules in a way that invited blackouts and
exploitation.  Given that the particular set of rules crafted by the state
of California sucked, does there exist a set of rules that doesn't suck?  
If there does exist a better set of rules, then reregulation isn't
necessarily the answer.You can't blame businesses for being profit maximizers.  Yes, the people 
involved were heartless and corrupt.  But mainly they just did their 
jobs.The guilty parties are either the mathematicians and economists who wrote
the rules or, if the mathematicians and economists said there were no good
rules, pro-deregulation politicians who went ahead anyway.- Lucas",Safe Email

"re : check this out ! dear friend , greetings ! hopefully my name is on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is basically the same letter you havve in your hands . he asked me to verify that this letter was legal . i told him i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off the wall idea to make money . a week and a half later we met in my offic to discuss the issue . i told him the letter he brought me was not 100 % legal and advised him to make a small change so it would be . i was still curious about the letter and he told me how it works . i thought it was a longshot so i decided against participation , but before my client left i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later , he called me to tell me he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! i did n't believe him , so he suggested i try his idea to find out for myself . i thought about it for a couple of weeks and decided i had nothing to lose . i asked him for a copy of the letter and followed the instructions exactly , mailed out 200 copies and sure enough , the money started arriving ! it came slowly at first but after three weeks i was getting more mail than i could open in a day ! after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise copy of my earnings and at the end of the three months they totaled $ 968 , 493 ! i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i decided to try the letter again but this time sent out 500 letters . well , three months later , my earnings totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 ! i just could not believe it , i met with my old client for lunch to find out how it worked . what made this one different from others were that there are six names on the list , not five like most others . that fact alone results in your name being on far more returns . the other factor was the help i gave him in ensuring the whole thing was legal , since nobody wants to risk doing something illegal . i ' ll bet by now you are curious to know what little change i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to make it legal you must actually sell something if you expect to receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the six people on the list , you must include a slip of paper with the words , "" please put me on your mailing list "" and enclose your mailing address . you need not include your name . this is the legal key to this program ! the item you received for the dollar you send the six names below is this letter and the right to earn thousands ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in three months you should receive over $ 800 , 000 ! ! ! $ 800 , 000 in less than 90 days ! ! ! guaranteed ! ! here is the business capital you need ! act now and be finacially solvent by the year 1999 ! ! this is a method of raising capital that really works every time , 100 percent . i ' m sure you could use the money in the next 20 to 90 day . s please study this carfully . this is not a chain letter ! this is a perfectly legal money making opportunity that will cost you a couple of rolls of stamps , a mailing list and six bucks . follow these instructions exactly and you will receive $ 800 , 000 in cash from business minded individuals just like yourself . 1 . immediately send $ 1 . 00 to each of the names below , and a note requesting you be added to their mailing lists . it is this important step that makes the system legal 2 . omit the name in the number 1 position and move each of the other names up one place ( number 2 becomes number 1 , number 3 becomes number 2 , 4 becomes number 3 etc . ) put your own name and address in the sixth position ( an easy way to do this is to type the six names , with your own name as number six , on a separate sheet of paper and tape over the area where the names are printed . ) 3 . print out 200 copies of these pages with the new list of names that you have created . your name now in the sixth position , in place of the current list of names . 4 . purchase a mailing list from the dataline co . or any other mail list sellers . most names list sell 200 names for only $ 26 . 00 . the best part is that the list of names come on self-adhesive labels that easily peel and stick to the envelope . just call 1-800 - 497-2912 . * * * mailing lists are also available from list associates at 1-888 - 359-2621 or mailing lists at 954-742 - 9519 . or check on the internet for other mail brokers . 5 . while waiting for the mailing list to arrive , place each of your 200 copies into business sized envelopes and seal them . go to the post office and purchase 200 . 32 cent stamps and place them on the envelopes . do not put your return address on the envelopes . . . this will peak the curiosity of the recipient . 6 . once your list arrives , place an address label on each of the 200 envelopes and drop them in the mailbox . within 20 to 90 days you will recieve over $ 800 , 000 in cash - and its all yours ! now comes the interesting part . . that 's with only a 7 . 5 % response rate ( which is very conservative . it 's more than possible to reach the amount every time ! ) the first time i participated my response rate was 9 . 5 % . my second was over 11 % 7 . keep this letter so you can use it as many times as you wish . using the addresses that people send you can raise the response rate because they also wish to conitine receiving more capital . * * this system was made for the purpose of accumulating capital fast and honestly . once again , this is not a chain letter , but perfectly legal ( refer to title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 of the united states postal and lottery laws ) . when you send out 200 copies of this letter , each responsive individual sends out 200 copies and send you $ 1 . 00 , thereby multiplying your fortune very rapidly ! examine the chart of how this system is the best in america for raising capital ! ! ! * * you mail 200 letters , multiply that by 7 . 5 % return rate = 15 people + $ 15 * * 15 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 225 people = $ 225 * * 225 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 3375 people = $ 3375 * * 3375 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 50 , 625 people = $ 50 , 625 * * 50 , 625 people mail 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 759 , 375 people = $ 759 , 375 * * * at this point your name drops off the list , but so far you ' ve received $ 813 , 615 ! ! ! * be sure to mail $ 1 . 00 to each of teh six names on the list * 1 . john salinas 100 deseret dr . , pasco , wa 99301 2 . elizabeth potts 7714 west jenan dr , peoria , az 85345 3 . lavonda walton 4005 parkway apt . # 11 , temple hills , md 20748 4 . murry mcneal 316 rachels trail , st . peters , mo 63376 5 . joseph swenson 544 1 / 2 7th ave w . , kalispell , mt 59901 6 . suzy krogman po box 802167 , santa clarita , ca 91380 this system is guaranteed to work 100 percent of the time in raising capital , but , if you remove any other name aside from the one in the number one position , you will not be covered by the title 18 in the u . s . postal law . the best part about this is you won't be hurting anyone . it will take only about $ 100 to participate . it is legal , so make money honestly and start today !",Phishing Email

"hurricane warning derivatives folks , this note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line of products . it is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane warning frequency and / or duration . it is our objective to develop derivative products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this exposure . we have generated a partial brainstorm - style list of whom natural counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure : pro - hurricane anti - hurricane the weather channel resorts home depot cruise ships lowes riverboat casinos cnn chemical plants and refineries local tv stations u . s armed forces dry ice manufacturers athletic teams chainsaw manufacturers city governments insect repellant manufacturers state governments it is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is important to note that the pro - hurricane entities are more macro in nature while the anti - hurricane entities are typically more regional . thus , we have documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the thought that the anti - hurricane entities would be interested in regional products and the pro - hurricane entities would likely be more interested in bundled regional products depending on their exposure . thus far , we have collected and documented all u . s hurricane warning data from 1980 - 2000 in the form of an excel database . the data can be sorted by year , storm , or location on the u . s coastline . total hurricane warning duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary data sets of interest for any given location ( or year or storm ) . the u . s coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly similar size . these regions are : new england , mid - atlantic , virginia , north carolina , georgia / south carolina , east florida , west florida , florida panhandle , orleans / miss / bama , lousiana , and texas . while this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes , it has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration is quite volatile and unpredictable . it is believed that this volaility , when graphically depicted and mathematically represented , could be used to effectively demonstrate to would - be customers the impact of hurricane warning frequency on their business financials . in many cases , businesses may be well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves . as we move forward on the modeling front , the data will certainly need to be scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends , satellite availability , population trends , etc . additionally , we need to go further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn ' t decline . on the marketing front , i am certainly open to ideas . it is believed the weather channel would be the most natural party for such a product . given our positive relationship that we currently have with them , they might be the easiest sell . any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when we should approach customers . please respond with any questions , comments or concerns on this project . thanks , charlie",Safe Email

"" mistakes "" which the author made ( statements which would render the text less valuable for comparative philosophy ) are tacitly "" corrected "" ( read : deleted ) , terminology is adjusted etc . - this phenomenon itself is grounded in the personal union of translator and historician , translator and interpreter , translator and commentator . while a translation of a novel can be done by one person , who is a translator in a more technical sense , and can be thoroughly researched in its historical impact by somebody else , who is a literature-historian , this is not only uncommon in the field of comparative philosophy ( or the study of other cultures ' philosophies ) , but also hardly feasible - for in most cases , even the philological constitution of the texts in question has to be informed by the interpretation . this results in a quite difficult ( and peculiar ) position of translation in the whole hermeneutical process - in most cases , the translation will serve as a "" second-language "" - commentary to the translated texts , not presenting an otherwise inaccessible philosophical text in its own right to those who do not understand the source-language , but a ) justifying the constitution of the text , b ) clarifying the interpretation on part of the translator and c ) ( see above ) justifying the project of translation for those who not only do understand the source-language , but who are already basically familiar with the historical and philosophical environment . in this context , translation loses much of its "" mediating "" function between two languages , but becomes a tool of explanation , which , in some contexts , can even be dismissed with ( i have seen and heard many specialists in indian philosophy whose explanations are basically made up of sanskrit terms , only vaguely connected by english copula ) . while this can naturally be explained on account of different target audiences ( translations for specialists will be different from translations for non-specialists ) , i find that this different function of translation is not recognized within the "" specialists ' "" group at all . in other words : criteria which would apply to judging a translation in a broader context ( e . g . a translation of a novel ) are applied to translations which are carried out in this specific context , without even considering a possible difference in the pragmatic environment . i would thoroughly appreciate any opinions on this , birgit kellner institute for indian philosophy university of hiroshima",Safe Email
"FROM: COL. MICHAEL BUNDU. 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. 
Tel No: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236
email : mikebundu@rediffmail.com
Dear Sir/Madam
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This
is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a 
dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange
and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence 
and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the
Democratic Republic of Congo and one of 
the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of
Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may 
his soul rest in peace. Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in
my country, I and some of my colleagues were 
instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and
ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel
group. We were then given this money privately 
by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other
Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila 
was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we
were schedule to travel out of Congo, We 
immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here
in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the 
said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and
seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava 
(One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military
Personnel from our same tribe, by the new 
President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President
Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who
can assist us to move this money out of my country 
as the beneficiary. 
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic
Cover to a security company in Europe in your 
name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked
''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it 
will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from
our lack of trust of our supposed good friends 
(western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked
with the late President Kabila, immediately 
after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,
the information We gathered from an associate 
who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with
your sincere assistance, this transaction will 
be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two
weeks. The said money is a state fund and 
therefore requires a total confidentiality. We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this
fund in Europe. This is because we are under 
restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in
order not to lose this fund which we have worked 
so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out
of Congo, you can contact me through my email 
addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal
information to enable us discuss the 
modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's
Security is Guaranteed if we follow the required 
guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as
soon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist 
us. I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the
utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily 
confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.
Thank you and God Bless. 
Best Regards 
COL. MICHAEL BUNDU(RTD). m_bundu@rediffmail.comN\B. When you are calling my line, you dial your country Intl. access

I had just finished giving Ben and his sister a ""behind
the scenes"" look at our set, when Patrick walked in and poked me
in the left arm repeatedly with his index finger - until I hung up
the phone and gave him my full, undivided attention. ""Did you know
that your GnomeTomes are being featured in the 'Barnes & Noble'
eBooks section,"" he asked. Well, that was news to me. After
flailing over to his workstation and flipping through a few pages,
we ultimately realized that he had discovered the entry on the
main page for Amazon's
eBooks. Cool! ""With a name that inspires curiosity and sparks the imagination,
Lockergnome represents one of the latest and most popular
additions to our e-documents catalog. At prices starting under $3,
these eminently useful titles from one of the most fanciful-sounding
publishers we've encountered are hard to resist."" Thank
you for helping us along, gang. My ultimate goal is to kick that
Godin guy out of the top ten - if only for a day.PC World Picks

I must now thank both Lockergnomie Dan Reain and Nancy Workman-Luter
(both from Sonic Foundry) for donating a couple more prizes
for this year's Gnomedex
conference. Just by walking through the entrance with your
pass in hand, you'll be automatically entered to win one of the
copies of Sound Forge XP! And this software is no slouch; for home
users and professionals on a Windows OS, it's one of the best
audio editors around. If it can't do something you need to have
done, then I bet it can't be done at all. Expect a full
Lockergnome review from our Digital Media editor (Jake) at some
point in the future. Until then, feel free to
download
the demo. If I can ever decide on a digital video camera,
perhaps their Vegas Video will sit on my system, too. Melanie and
I were talking about hardware options the other day. She's leaning
towards a Canon, too. Unless I hear or see otherwise, the ZR45MC
is at the top of my list. Still and low-light images aren't the
best, but I'm not really up for spending much more than $1000.
Neither is Gretchen, oddly enough.As much as I dislike the AOL client user interface, I gotta admit:
it's pretty darn powerful underneath. For instance, you can
""unsend"" an e-mail message (but only if it was sent to another
America Online member and s/he hasn't read it yet). If you travel
often, the service is a bargain. If you know someone who just
needs the Internet basics, it's perfect. One caveat: the software
puts RealPlayer on your system without asking you first. I was a
little upset when I discovered its icon sitting in my Start Menu.
Nowhere during the installation process did I see a way to opt out
of it. I'm not surprised; there are more advertisements on AOL
than there are from your average ""free"" Web page host. You may
have asked yourself: ""What is Chris doing installing AOL in the
first place?!"" I don't blame
you. No, hell did not freeze over. We've been doing tips for
their users on our show lately, and I decided to throw it on my
laptop for testing purposes. Perhaps 8.0 will be better?
See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Chris PirilloÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â

SEPopular v1.02 [2.4M] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://www.monocle-solutions.com/sepopular/sepopular.shtml{Popularity contest} I never considered myself to be part of the popular crowd. But how do you really know if others consider you to be popular? Well, if you are talking about the popularity of your website (although the junior high kids are more concerned about the labels on your clothes), then all you have to do is download SEPopular. Search engines (such as Google) rank your site by determining how many people link to your site (the more people who link to your site, the better your ranking). With this investigative tool, you can see how many links to your website there are (from the perspective of five major search engines). You don't just have to check out your own website, though... all you have to do is enter the URL of a website, and out comes the TRUTH about its popularity. Another nice feature of this software is that you can import web addresses from a .txt file so that you don't have to enter each one individually. It's all about keeping up with thejoneses.com.
MB-Ruler v0.93 [441k] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://www.markus-bader.de/MB-Ruler/{Measure distance and angles} I was never very good in geometry... Pythagoras would be disappointed that I can never exactly remember his theorem. (What did a hippopotamus have to do with triangles anyway? That animal seems to be pretty round if you ask me...) Anyway, MB-Ruler is quite a useful little application, especially for anyone who has had to work with banners and graphics for the Web. You can measure angles in radians or degrees, and distances in inches, centimeters, twips, points or pixels. And if those weren't enough options, you can even set your own scale. Everything about MB-Ruler can be customized, including its size and color. Talk about an application that ""measures up!""

Your Outlook Express Password Is Not Retainedhttp://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q264672{Fixing password problems} Now where did I put that password? I thought I had Outlook Express keeping track of it for me... If you use Outlook Express (for Windows 2000 or Windows XP) to check your e-mail, then this article is for you. Occasionally your password for Outlook Express is not retained, even though you have checked the ""Remember Password"" checkbox. To fix this particular issue, you will need Administrator privileges in order to make some modifications to your system's registry. The article contains steps for backing up your registry and, since you can cause a lot of accidental damage while tweaking the registry... I would recommend that you follow them.

Re-route E-mail Forwarding Servicehttp://www.re-route.com/Soon, it will be time for us to fill out the change of address cards as we relocate to a different area of the city. You probably knew that your snail mail could be forwarded, but what about your e-mail? Back in the days of college e-mail accounts, every time I changed ISPs I had to send a mass e-mail to my contacts and hope they saved my new address, otherwise I could miss out on getting their correspondence. The great thing about Re-Route's service is that I don't have to worry about lost e-mails after changing ISPs. Sign up for the service, and they will take any e-mail sent to your old account and forward it to your new e-mail address. After that, Re-Route e-mails the sender to notify them of your new address. If you are with AOL, MSN, or any of their featured partners, then the first month is free. If not, then Re-Route charges a very nominal fee of ten bucks for the one month and twenty-five bucks for 3 months. Have someone else handle all my changing e-mail address need!
s? Sounds like money well spent!

Â GnomeTIPJust because it is summer and bright out doesn't mean that you should stop using your flash on your digital camera. Bright sunlight creates harsh shadows that may cause you to lose detail. Don't you hate those pictures where you can only see half of someone's face because the other half is black from a shadow? Well, the cure is in front of you... use your flash during the daytime to throw a little light into those shadows. Some cameras allow you to adjust how much flash is used, also known as flash exposure compensation. If you can adjust the output of your flash, then try it at the lowest setting first. Remember, you don't want to completely get rid of the shadows because they add depth to your photo. Keep increasing your flash output until you get your desired results. Also, as an extra tip, don't forget that you can conserve battery life on your digital camera by turning on the autofocus option and turning off the LCD display.

"workshop on embodied conversational character 2nd call for papers the first workshop on embodied conversational characters granlibakken resort & conference center at lake tahoe tahoe city ( north shore ) california , usa october 12-15 , 1998 with the support of aaai cooperation of acm / sigchi recent advances in several core software technologies have made possible a new type of human-computer interface : the conversational character . conversational characters are autonomous , anthropomorphic , animated figures that have the ability to communicate through multiple modalities , including spoken language , facial expressions , and gestures . unlike textual natural language interfaces , conversational characters have the ability to perceive and produce the verbal and non-verbal signals that identify discourse structure and regulate the flow of information between interlocutors . such signals include intonational patterns , gestures , back-channel feedback signals , and turn-taking protocols . these capabilities enable them to engage in complex interactions with human users via natural speech rather than complex command languages , menus or graphical manipulations . research on conversational characters has emerged from a number of disciplines , including , among others , artificial intelligence , computational linguistics , computer animation , computer vision , psychology , cognitive science , virtual reality , cscw , and hci . this diversity is naturally reflected in the broad range of active research areas in conversational character interfaces . the primary goal of this workshop is to advance the state of conversational character research and development by identifying novel approaches to the topics and issues listed below , and integrating them into a framework for embodied , conversational human-computer interaction . selected contributors will be invited to expand and refine their papers for inclusion in a book to be published by addison - wesley . the aims of this book will be to introduce , define , and advance the field ; to give a snapshot of current work in it ; and to suggest future challenges and opportunities . particular topics of interest include , but are not limited to : * multi - modal interaction * autonomy * recognition & perception of speech , * behavior / dialogue planning gesture , facial expressions , etc . * distribution of semantic information * reactivity and opportunism across multiple modalities * rendering techniques * representation * semantic representations for * character individuation non-verbal communication * dialogue planning * affect and personality * turn - taking and back-channel signals * user studies * spoken language processing * tools for character * discourse structure building / authoring * intonation * architectures & applications papers should address one or more of these topics . demonstrations and video presentations of working systems are strongly encouraged . format the two and a half-day workshop will include several paper sessions , organized around emerging themes , with follow-up panel discussions . in addition , there will be a demonstration session for authors to present working systems . attendance attendance will be limited to 35-40 people . preference will be given to authors whose papers have been selected for presentation at the workshop . submission requirements paper submissions are due on june 15 , 1998 , and should be no longer than 6 pages ( 10-12 point font ) . upon acceptance , authors will be given the opportunity to expand their papers to 8-10 pages . electronic submissions in postscript or microsoft word formats are preferred , and should be sent to prevost @ pal . xerox . com . otherwise , send four hardcopies to : scott prevost attn : embodied conversational characters workshop fx palo alto laboratory 3400 hillview avenue , bldg . 4 palo alto , ca 94304 voice : 650 / 813-7701 deadlines submissions due june 15th notification of acceptance august 17th final papers due september 14th workshop october 12th - 15th workshop organizers joseph w . sullivan , fx palo alto lab , usa ( sullivan @ pal . xerox . com ) justine cassell , mit media laboratory , usa ( justine @ media . mit . edu ) workshop program committee committee co - chairs : scott prevost , fx palo alto lab , usa ( prevost @ pal . xerox . com ) elizabeth churchill , fx palo alto lab , usa ( churchill @ pal . xerox . com ) committee members : elisabeth andr , dfki gmbh , germany ( elisabeth . andre @ dfki . de ) gene ball , microsoft research , usa ( geneb @ microsoft . com ) phil cohen , oregon graduate institute , usa ( pcohen @ cse . ogi . edu ) barbara hayes - roth , stanford univ . , usa ( hayes-roth @ cs . stanford . edu ) kenji mase , atr international , japan ( mase @ mic . atr . co . jp ) clifford nass , stanford university , usa ( nass @ leland . stanford . edu ) mark steedman , university of pennsylvania , usa ( steedman @ cis . upenn . edu ) kris thorisson , lego a / s , denmark ( kris @ digi . lego . com ) demos chair : timothy bickmore , isii inc . , usa ( bickmore @ pal . xerox . com ) additional information for more information , please consult the workshop web page : www . fxpal . com / wecc98 /",Safe Email

"The Times August 28, 2002
 
 It's August, and big cats are on the prowl
 By Alan Hamilton
 
 
 
 ROUND up the sheep. Pull on the gauntlets. Oil the shotgun. The British
 countryside is crawling with pumas, black panthers, fen tigers and other big,
 vicious cats. No corner of the nation is safe. Evidence released yesterday,
 including sightings, photographs, paw prints, livestock kills and hair
 samples, claims to prove that every county has big cats lurking in its
 undergrowth, poised to pounce on man and beast alike. 
 
 Sightings have reached record levels in 2002, according to Daniel Bamping,
 founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past 12 months has
 received more than 800 reports of big cat sightings. 
 
 Â“During the first six months we have seen an incredible amount of big cat
 activity. We have now had reports in every single county; the response from
 the public has been fantastic,Â” Mr Bamping said. Â“Big cats in Britain are
 real. They are out there, they are breeding; thereÂ’s more of them.Â” 
 
 Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark
 Fraser, who heads the societyÂ’s Scottish arm, said: Â“Lynx are now present in
 the Scottish countryside; I believe they are established and breeding. I donÂ’t
 want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several
 hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Borders.Â” 
 
 Next month the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which
 includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and tree scratchings, as
 well as stories of a horse strangely lacerated in West Wales and a man in
 Gravesham, Kent, who had to beat a hasty retreat to his garage after his hand
 was cut by a creature the size of a labrador dog, except that it had black
 hairy tufts on the tips of its ears. 
 
 The society is taking the sightings seriously. It plans to set up a network of
 trigger-cameras throughout the country to capture further evidence of the
 beasts, which it will then present to the Government. 
 
 It is not, however, clear on what it wants the Government to do about it all.
 Throwing its weight behind the pro-hunting lobby might be a start. 
 
 Next in August: record abductions by aliens.

different tool kit. With gnomehide, I ported a lot of gtk1.2 themes to gtk2,
because they are rarely compatible. Those themes are on dudex.net/rpms/ but it
does not matter unless you have gnome2.In gnomehide, the apps that actually use gtk2 are Nautilus, gedit, some of the

course the gnome panels and menus.--

         so we better roll the presses on the bad news. The CAMPAIGN
         FOR DIGITAL RIGHTS published its first in-depth analysis of
         the EUCD. For this exciting installment, CD-R has
         concentrated on what it does to people who have to
         circumvent copy protection to do their job. The short
         summary is: if they're not a teacher, a prison warder,
         disabled, or the cops, they can forget their jobs. If you're
         anyone else - like a musician, or a cryptographer -  and the
         copy protection says you can't make a backup, you can't. And
         even if you *are* a teacher or other exceptional person,
         you'll have to ask the Secretary of State if you can crack
         the protected CD. In writing. Each time.

                                   - what you can do to stop all this         But there's plenty more to ooze out of the law than that.
         One of the big questions about the EUCD is ""is it the
         European DMCA, or what?"". Well, the DMCA spurted bad juice
         in many different directions, but one way in which the two
         are similiar is over ""circumvention devices"". Distributing
         DeCSS, the DVD lobby have claimed, is a crime under the
         DMCA. DeCSS is code that was also a magically dangerous
         artifact: a circumvention device. Circumvention devices are
         about to become illegal here. Specifically, three months in
         chokey (or two years if you really nark the judge), for
         those who ""distribute otherwise than in the course of a
         business to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the
         copyright owner"" one of them. ""Otherwise in the course of
         business"" is legalese for ""as an ordinary punter"", so it's
         not just mod-chip sellers who are liable. Anyone who
         distributes such satanic machines is also a perp.

                                   - what you can do to stop all this         That's not going to go down well with ANDREW SIMMONS.
         Regular NTK readers will remember Andrew as a lightning rod
         to lawyers. Not only was he John Doe #13 in the American
         DeCSS case, but in a completely unrelated affair, he waws
         threatened with all manner of nastiness just for publishing
         his list of doomed dotcoms on his Website [NTK 2000-09-22].
         In the last week, he's had another letter via Demon, finally
         ordering him to remove his shiny ""circumvention device"" (aka
         DeCSS) from his site. It sounds like the lawyers may have
         shot their wad a tad early: the EUCD rules don't kick in
         until Christmas. But when the new laws do hit, and if what
         Andrew's preposterous correspondent says is believed in a UK
         court, hosting DeCSS *will* mean jail. There's been some
         talk about how the EUCD rules are better than the DMCA,
         because they specifically exclude computer programs from the
         new rules. Well, it looks like DeCSS is no longer just a
         computer program. From now on, it could become a special ""nick me""
         tag for your Website.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering         The crazy counterintuitive conditional probability world of
         BAYES THEOREM has a reputation for making judges look stupid
         in DNA-testing murder cases, and search-engines look even
         stupider when they suggest ""relevant documents"" - but it's
         getting a bit of a re-renaissance in the spam filtering
         world. Tradition states Naive Bayesian alone doesn't work
         well enough at filtering by example, so it's good to see
         dozens of people independently sloshing around the noospere
         looking for better tweaked solutions. Including, of course,
         leading noosphere cadet ERIC S RAYMOND, whose Bayesian
         BOGOFILTER is fast, has extra smarts, and is up to version
         0.2. Unfortunately, as with Raymond's abandoned kernel
         configurator and recent anti-gay anti-islam anti-vegetable
         rants, it requires taking on board just a *bit* too
         much extra baggage to really take off. Rennies' IFILE around
         has been around for a while, and has support for MH and
         mutt. Gary Arnold's BAYESPAM is something he knocked up in
         Perl for qmail; a good start if you want to try this
         yourself. Which you should, because nobody's cracked it yet.

I have a couple of small issues, and I'm not sure if their exmh issues
or my setup issues.First, when I try and run exmh with wish from tk8.4.0 it seems to take
forever to start, but with wish from tk8.a.4 it starts in a snap.Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen
messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages
rather than to the first unseen in the current folder.Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to
the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen
messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages.  (When I 
goto next from inbox it does go where I would think it should go).Just wanted to let you know what I'm seeing and find out if I'm expecting
some different than I should be.Thanks for all the effortJim

Be amazed - I've never bought anything online since an almighty cock up
with amazon dot con (that's not a typo) a few years back where I lost
all the dosh I'd paid them and had no books to show for it either. Had
it been the UK branch I'd have had them in the small claims court

was the US branch I'd just no comeback.

"summary : polish phonology not too long ago i posted a request for polish informants who were also linguists in the hope of getting some quick responses to some questions about polish phonology which are not fully addressed in the literature . the response has been tremendous . since the details may not be of interest , and since i am not sure if all respondents want their names used , i will summarize as follows : most respondents report having a contrast between the sequences [ k ' e ] and [ kje ] as well as [ g ' e ] and [ gje ] , where by [ k ' ] and [ g ' ] i mean a fronted velar probably not quite as front as ipa [ c ] , though . a minority of respondents report no contrast , which is apparently the result of a very recent and presumably spreading sound change . of those speakers who do have the contrast , most report also having a similar contrast between [ x ' e ] and [ xje ] sequences , although one or two do not . it is this last contrast , [ x ' e ] vs . [ xje ] ( both distinct also from [ xe ] ) which is of special interest because in attested forms it only appears before one suffix , a rather peculiar one at that . the suffix is spelled - ewicz and it forms last names such as stankiewicz or banachiewicz . it is also clear that such names come from eastern poland , and that the [ x ' e ] pronunciation is thus a borrowing into standard polish from some eastern dialects and ultimately from east slavic ( belorussian / ukrainian ) . synchronically , however , it is a genuine contrast and one of special interest to those phonologists who are interested in the universals governing the possible systems of contrasts ( e . g . , in lexical phonology 's structure preservation , ) . great thanks to everybody who has responded so far . once i verify whether i am authorized to publicize people 's names i will post a "" nonymous "" acknowledgement . any additional information on this topic would be welcome . alexis mr",Safe Email

' ' houston - based enron has lost $ 26 billion in market value since mid - october , when the company restated $ 586 million in earnings and disclosed that its executives may have profited from enron ' s dealings with affiliated partnerships that bought enron assets . enron , which was the buyer or seller on every transaction on its web site , handles only a fraction of the trades it once did . the company said today it will fire 4 , 000 workers in houston . ` difficult to resurrect ' the wholesale trading business of enrononline , which had been a valuable property , ` ` has for all practical purposes ceased operation and in a post - bankruptcy scenario , may in fact be difficult to resurrect , ' ' fitch inc . , a chicago - based firm that rates corporate credit , said in a report today . trading has surged in markets that compete with enron , including the new york mercantile exchange and intercontinental exchange inc . dynegy inc . chief executive officer chuck watson said his company ' s energy - trading web site has seen increased traffic . ` ` enrononline will just disappear , ' ' said peter fusaro , president of global change associates inc . , a consulting firm in new york . enron ' s portfolio of trades ` ` is evaporating ' ' and ` ` is replaceable ' ' with competing electronic trading platforms . dynegy ' s watson said on a conference call with analysts and investors that his company would try to expand in europe , where enron was the dominant energy trader . enron said friday it would fire more than 1 , 000 workers in europe . shutdown enrononline shut down wednesday after dynegy canceled its plans to buy enron , depriving enron of the cash it needed to meet its obligations and all but ensuring the company would be forced to seek protection from its creditors . later in the week , the site was offering trading in 472 commodity products , a third of its usual offerings , according to company officials . on thursday , the site logged 825 trades , down from the normal amount of about 5 , 000 . ` ` we ' re actively trading , ' ' enron spokesman eric thode said today , declining to elaborate . ` ` there may still be trading going on , but it ' s primarily to unwind positions , ' ' fitch credit analyst ralph pellecchia said . ` ` it ' s certainly not new growth or for profitability . for all intents and purposes , enron ' s horsepower , its earnings - generating machine , has been effectively shut down . ' ' needs capital enron declined to name the ` ` leading financial institutions ' ' it is in talks with to provide new capital for the trading business . ` ` if these discussions are successful , they could result in the creation of a new trading entity with a strong and unencumbered balance sheet , ' ' whalley said . ` ` we understand that it may take time for counterparties to resume normal trading levels with this entity , but we are confident that this business can be put back on a solid footing . ' ' enron ' s top creditors include citigroup inc . ' s citibank and j . p . morgan chase & co . the blackstone group is helping enron with its financial restructuring . a revival of enron ' s trading business isn ' t likely anytime soon , analysts said . it may take ` ` months to years , if ever , ' ' said david chang , manager of natural gas trading at bank of america na . in the meantime , enron has ` ` alienated a lot of its suppliers and customers , ' ' he said . ` ` it would be difficult for ' ' enron to come back . stopped shipping nisource inc . , which operates 16 , 000 miles of gas pipelines , stopped shipping enron ' s gas on saturday because of credit concerns , company spokesman kelly merritt said . williams cos . , which controls 27 , 000 miles of pipes , stopped shipping enron ' s gas last week . ` ` enron has lost all credibility , ' ' fusaro said . in the meantime , some traders that had become accustomed to the ease and speed of online transactions are finding it difficult to adjust . kevin cokinos , co - owner and vice president at cokinos energy corp . in houston , said he has had to rely on his old network of telephone brokers for price quotes rather than enron ' s web site . ` ` it ' s hard to do as many deals because you ' re spending so much more time on each one , ' ' said cokinos , whose company trades about 500 million cubic feet of gas a day . ` ` we hope somebody picks up enrononline so it will come back the way it operated before . but that might be kind of tough .

' ' citigroup , the largest u . s . financial services company , is probably owed $ 1 billion at most , analysts say , and much of that is backed by collateral such as gas pipelines , on which it should be able to collect . the company ' s profit may be lowered by between $ 250 million and $ 500 million before taxes , or between 3 cents and 5 cents a share after taxes , as a result of its involvement with enron , said napoli , who recommends investors buy citigroup shares . citigroup earned $ 2 . 08 a share in the first nine months of the year . hurting earnings j . p . morgan chase - - which enron says is owed $ 2 . 1 billion - - says its exposure totals about $ 900 million - - $ 500 million unsecured , and $ 400 million backed by collateral . that exposure could result in a 15 - cent decline in earnings per share , said goldman , sachs & co . analyst richard strauss . the second - largest u . s . bank earned $ 1 . 54 a share so far this year . j . p . morgan chase acts as a representative for holders of enron bonds , so while the company is listed by enron as a creditor on $ 1 . 9 billion of bonds , it may not be owed a cent on that debt . enron ' s $ 2 . 45 billion debt to bank of new york may work in much the same way , said lehman brothers analyst henry dickson . he estimated the bank is owed about $ 50 million . much of j . p . morgan ' s exposure is tied to citigroup ' s $ 3 billion loan to enron , a credit enron doesn ' t even mention . a syndicate of at least five other banks - - including j . p . morgan chase - - contributed to that loan , according to bloomberg data . as lead arranger , citigroup likely holds about 10 percent of the loan , meaning its exposure is about $ 300 million . j . p . morgan chase ' s share of that is likely less . bank of america corp . , commerzbank ag and barclays bank plc are among other enron lenders not listed as creditors . still , concern that the banks ' losses may exceed forecasts helped send their shares and bonds lower today . citigroup shares fell 99 cents to $ 46 . 91 in trading on the new york stock exchange . citigroup ' s 7 . 25 percent notes due in 2010 fell to 107 28 / 32 from 108 21 / 32 , pushing the yield up 21 basis points to 6 . 18 percent from 5 . 97 percent . j . p . morgan ' s stock lost $ 1 . 17 to $ 36 . 55 . its 7 . 9 percent coupon notes due in 2010 fell $ 16 per $ 1 , 000 face amount to 111 3 / 32 , pushing the yield up 23 basis points to 6 . 18 percent from 5 . 95 percent on friday . bank of new york ' s 7 . 3 percent notes maturing in 2009 fell about $ 20 per $ 1 , 000 face value to 108 3 / 32 from 110 7 / 32 , traders said . yield on the debt rose 32 basis points to 6 . 01 percent from 5 . 69 percent . its shares dropped $ 1 . 04 to $ 38 . 20 . ` ` they ' re big numbers , but these are big institutions , ' ' said greg habeeb , a bond money manager at calvert group , which doesn ' t own the banks ' securities . ` ` i wouldn ' t be going running out buying the bonds now , but i don ' t think ( enron losses are ) big enough to worry about .

"" the events in israel have created a lot of uncertainty , "" said peter coolidge , senior equity trader at brean murray & co . "" that more than counteracts any positive news on the economic front . "" at least 25 people were killed over the weekend in attacks by palestinian suicide bombers in jerusalem and the northern israeli port city of haifa . on monday , israel fired nine missiles near palestinian leader yasser arafat ' s headquarters in gaza city in an apparent retaliation . the violence overseas detracted from some fairly upbeat readings on the u . s . economy , including a report from the commerce department that consumer spending rose by a record 2 . 9 % in october . robust spending on cars and other big - ticket items contributed to the reading ' s largest jump since 1959 , when the data series began . the previous record had been a 2 . 6 % increase in september 1987 . personal income was virtually unchanged for the second month in a row , roughly in line with economists ' forecasts . the commerce department also surprised economists by reporting a 1 . 9 % increase in total construction spending for october . forecasts had that figure falling by 0 . 5 % . september construction spending was revised to show a 0 . 7 % drop from the 0 . 4 % decline previously reported . meanwhile , a closely watched index of manufacturing activity rose more than expected in november . the national association of purchasing management reported monday that its purchasing managers index rose to 44 . 5 last month from 39 . 8 in october . economists have been forecasting the pmi would rise to 42 . a pmi reading of 42 . 7 is considered the threshold between expansion and contraction in the wider economy . so november ' s pmi of 44 . 5 suggests that the economy is growing , albeit slowly . last week , the national bureau of economic research formally declared that the country had entered a recession back in march , ending the longest period of economic expansion in u . s . history . the government reported that total economic activity fell at an annual rate of 1 . 1 % in the july - september quarter . against this backdrop , analysts called the latest napm data encouraging . "" after absorbing last month ' s aftershock of the terrorist attacks , the manufacturing sector showed surprising resilience in november , "" norbert ore , director of the survey , said in a statement . "" the trend is definitely in the right direction , but it is too soon to claim an imminent recovery . based on this report , the sector regained a significant portion of the output lost in october , "" mr . ore said . matthew freedman , an economist at economy . com , said the napm report "" shows that the deterioration in manufacturing appears to be slowing quite dramatically . "" but the stronger - than - expected numbers did little to comfort investors , who have been scrutinizing economic readings in recent weeks for signs that the business cycle has hit bottom . the markets are especially interested to see if rising levels of unemployment will put a dent in consumer spending , which is considered a key to keeping the current economic recession a mild one . most major international markets traded lower monday , but the u . s . economic data helped narrow the losses late in the day in europe . frankfurt ' s xetra dax closed essentially flat and london ' s financial times stock exchange 100 - share finished 0 . 8 % lower . in asia , tokyo ' s nikkei 225 stock average closed with a loss of 3 . 1 % , and hong kong ' s hang seng index dropped 1 . 1 % . meanwhile , the turmoil surrounding energy - trading giant enron continued over the weekend , as the company filed for bankruptcy protection on sunday . the houston firm simultaneously sued its would - be merger partner dynegy for "" not less than $ 10 billion , "" accusing it of wrongful termination of their merger pact . news of the impending collapse of enron had weighed heavily on the market last week . some market participants suggested enron ' s bankruptcy filing - - the largest in u . s . history - - continued to pull stocks lower on monday . but others said it was largely expected and was having little effect on share prices . "" it could hurt the markets somewhere down the road , but i haven ' t heard a lot of people talking about it [ monday ] , "" said mr . coolidge of brean murray . enron shares rose 11 cents to 37 cents . dynegy was down nearly 8 % . financial - services stocks took a hit monday , dragged lower by some negative comments from analysts and fears about exposure to the enron debacle . shares of brokerage firm morgan stanley sank 6 % after goldman sachs analyst richard strauss pulled it from his recommended list and cut his rating on the stock to "" market perform "" from "" market outperform . "" mr . strauss said that the 60 % surge in morgan stanley ' s shares since sept . 20 has made it expensive compared to its peers . citigroup , a component of the dow jones industrials , declined nearly 2 . 7 % and j . p . morgan fell 3 . 8 % . the two companies advised on the failed merger between enron and dynegy and now find themselves among enron ' s largest unsecured creditors . automotive stocks were also trading lower monday as the big auto makers offered up monthly sales results for november . shares of ford motor were down 6 . 1 % on news that it is expected to warn this week that quarterly results will miss forecasts . separately , the company reported a 4 . 4 % increase in total u . s . vehicle sales , helped by 0 % financing offers . ford rival general motors , which has also been offering generous financing plans to lure buyers , reported a 13 . 3 % jump in car and truck sales from a year ago . shares of gm fell 1 . 4 % . in major u . s . market action : stocks fell . on the big board , where 923 . 7 million shares traded , 1 , 804 stocks fell and 1 , 291 rose . on the nasdaq , 1 . 17 billion shares changed hands . bonds rose . the 10 - year treasury note rose more than 1 / 4 point , or $ 2 . 50 for each $ 1 , 000 invested . the yield , which moves inversely to price , fell to 4 . 71 % . the 30 - year bond added more than 3 / 8 point to yield 5 . 26 % . the dollar strengthened . it bought 123 . 93 yen and traded at 89 . 14 cents to the euro , compared with 123 . 44 yen and 89 . 65 cents late friday in new york . copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dueling enron , dynegy lawsuits start of long battle by janet whitman of dow jones newswires 12 / 03 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - dueling lawsuits filed by former merger partners enron corp .

"" gonzalez , who was appointed to the federal bankruptcy court in new york in 1995 , has recently been hearing the case of sunbeam , which filed for chapter 11 protection this year after questions about its accounting . in may , federal securities regulators accused former top executives at the appliance maker - including former chief executive albert "" chainsaw al "" dunlap - of financial fraud that cost investors billions of dollars . last week , gonzalez postponed a hearing on sunbeam ' s second amended plan of reorganization - which was to be heard on tuesday - to next march 19 . coincidentally in both cases , in which the company ' s accounting is central , the accounting firm arthur andersen was auditor for sunbeam and also enron . gonzalez also oversaw the 1998 bankruptcy filing of livent inc . , the canadian theater - production company that collapsed amid major accounting irregularities . last year , gonzalez was on the bench for the case of iridium llc , a satellite telephone service , which entered the history books as one of the costliest corporate fiascoes of all time . the washington - based company cut off telephone service to its 55 , 000 customers as a prelude to court - ordered liquidation . iridium ' s last act was to "" de - orbit "" or ultimately burn up its constellation of 66 satellites . the network has been reported to have cost $ 5 billion to $ 7 billion . gonzalez cleared iridium to spend $ 8 . 3 million to start winding up its business while selling remaining earth - bound assets , including ground stations . last year , he was also in charge of the case involving u . s . media holdings inc . and its golden turtle press inc . unit which filed chapter 11 petitions . this year , gonzalez has been hearing the chapter 11 case of insurance company reliance group holdings inc . and also australia ' s collapsed hih insurance ltd . gonzalez received a degree in accounting from new york ' s fordham university in 1969 and a master ' s degree in education from brooklyn college in 1974 . he got his law degree at fordham university ' s law school in 1982 and llm in taxation in 1990 from new york university law school . after a spell in private practice , he was appointed assistant u . s . trustee in the southern district of new york in 1991 and u . s . trustee for the second circuit in 1993 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : us northwest natural seeks to buy portland general . by chris baltimore 12 / 03 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . washington , dec 3 ( reuters ) - northwest natural gas co said monday it asked approval from federal energy regulators to buy portland general electric co . from enron corp for $ 1 . 8 billion . northwest expects to soon file a similar request with the u . s . securities and exchange commission , a company spokesman said . the purchase is unrelated to the status of enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline , to which dynegy inc . is claiming rights after canceling a bid to purchase enron last week . portland , ore . - based northwest natural gas is a local natural gas distribution company that serves about 530 , 000 customers in oregon and washington . it is oregon ' s largest natural gas utility , while portland general is the state ' s biggest electric utility . northwest filed for approval with the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) on friday , after a similar application with the oregon public utilities commission on nov . 28 , with a response requested by may 15 , 2002 . the oregon commission ' s "" watershed approval "" would allow northwest to take operational control of portland general by the end of 2002 , said northwest spokesman jim boehlke . northwest said it wants ferc to act on its request by feb . 20 , 2002 . enron ' s declaration of bankruptcy over the weekend "" could complicate things "" for northwest ' s plans for portland general , boehlke said . but northwest is "" going forward ( with the purchase ) without regard for what it going on in the enron bankruptcy proceedings , "" he said . a bankruptcy court is likely to look favorably on northwest ' s purchase , boehlke said , because it will give enron cash to pay debts .

"words that are their own opposites : sum , cont 'd . here are some explanations of three famous types of auto-antonymy . bob fradkin gives us the auto-antonymy of verbs of covering / uncovering , chuck bigelow follows the english blackening of indo - european ' white ' , and david gamon explores how modal expressions may come to mean their opposite . * * * bob fradkin ( raf100f @ oduvm . cc . odu . edu ) writes : dust is part of a series of noun-verb conversions related to coverings of things . if the noun gives a covering that is natural to the thing , then the verb means "" remove the covering . "" if the covering is imposed , the verb means "" put the covering on . "" so you get "" shell an egg "" "" peel a banana "" but "" paint the furniture "" "" wax the floor . "" dust is interesting because it can go either way : "" dust the furniture "" ( a sort of natural covering to be removed ) vs . "" dust the crops "" ( put stuff on them that they did n't have and would n't unless humans put it there ) . i mentioned this in my english grammar book "" stalking the wild verb phrase "" ( univ . pr . of america 1991 ) at the end of chp . 3 . * * * chuck bigelow ( bigelow @ cs . stanford . edu ) writes : ) from historical linguistics , a well known example of a word 's meaning shifting to its opposite is english "" black "" , of which the indo - european root is * bhel - ' to shine , flash , burn , be white ' etc . another modern reflex of * bhel is "" bald "" - ' having a shining or white head ' . from a variant of * bhel - , * bhelg - / * bhleg - ' to shine , burn ' comes germanic * blakaz ' burned ' , and thence old english "" blaec "" - ' black , that which has been burned ' . nifty . ( i ' m using calvert watkins ' dictionary of ie roots , houghton mifflin , as reference . ) * * * david gamon ( gamon @ garnet . berkeley . edu ) writes : enantiodriomia refers to the diachronic process of acquiring an "" opposite "" meaning , and i suppose a word having two such meanings would be an enantiodrome . i learned this , by the way , from professor matisoff here at berkeley . enantiodromia of modals / attitudinals the first example of such a word i had drawn to my attention is * doubt * , which historically has a meaning such that to doubt that something be true meant to suspect it to be true . in some parts of northern england , i ' m told , it still has this meaning . this was brought to my attention by professor bill stewart at cuny . another example i ' m familiar with is the english modal * must * , which is reconstructed as meaning "" to have freedom or space "" ; the gothic cognate meant "" to be free or have permission ( to do something ) . "" there are two classes of explanation offered in the literature for this particular example of enantiodromia . first explanation : negation drops out klaren ( 1913 ) and antinucci and parisi ( 1971 ) propose that the semantic shift took place in a negative context , as follows : neg ( free to do x ) - - ) compelled ( neg ( do x ) ) given the equivalence of a lack of freedom to do something and a compulsion to not do something , an innovative "" compulsion "" semantics was reanalyzed from the "" freedom "" semantics in a negative context with concomitant scope change of the negative operator . the reanalysis is made esepcially perspicuous given a & p 's notation , which decomposes the older meaning of the modal ( freedom / persmission ) into the primes neg ( bind ( neg ) ) : if one is free to do something , then one is not bound to do it ; if this is negated , the first two negs cancel out to leave only the narrow-scope neg , with a resultant meaning of bind neg or "" compelled not "" with narrow-scope neg , as follows : cause ( x ) ( neg ( neg ( bind ( neg ( john goes out ) ) ) ) ) [ = j . may not go out ] - - - ) cause ( x ) ( bind ( neg ( john goes out ) ) ) [ = john must not go out ] the same sort of explanation could be applied in reverse to the german modal * duerfen * , which underwent a semantic shift from an original "" necessity "" or "" compulsion "" semantics ( cf . mod . germ . * beduerfen * "" need , require , "" * duerftig * "" needy , poor , lacking "" ) to the modern "" permission "" meaning : bind ( neg ( do x ) ) - - ) neg ( free ( do x ) ) however , the a&p notation fails to link the conservative and innovative senses in a natural manner . second explanation : antithetical nature of modality the other kind of explanation has been proposed by breal ( quoted in bech 1951 , p . 19 ) , visser ( 1963-73 , p . 1797 ) and traugott ( 1989 ) , and basically proposes that permission is used as a polite way of imposing obligation , with the implication subsequently being semanticized , or the originally indirect speech act giving way to direct , conventionalized coding . one might see the same sort of shift occurring in present-day english in contexts that suggest that this sort of explanation may indeed be valid , as in "" you may leave now . "" one can see from this , at least , that what counts as an "" opposite "" is largely a matter of the scale one implicitly chooses along which to arrange the items at issue , or the specific semantic prime upon which one chooses to focus . also , one would n't even think of conceptualizing the innovative meaning as antonymous if most of the conservative meaning were n't being preserved intact . another example is * prove * , which in middle english meant something like "" to test , "" or in a legal context , "" to put on trial . "" when the expression "" the exception proves the rule "" was coined , it quite logically meant that an exception or counterexample to a generalization or claim makes you question the generalization or that the exception so to speak puts the rule on trial . as the verb * prove * shifted its meaning 180 degrees , the expression , illogical though it then became , was preserved simply because it 's so handy - - whenever someone presents counterevidence to your claim , you can write it off as "" the exception that proves the rule "" !

"for the link - I'm fascinated by archaeology as well.----- Original Message ----- From: ""James Rogers"" To: Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 2:48 PM Subject: Re: Goodbye Global Warming I've seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forums for several years. I've always found archaeology interesting for no particular reason. Here is a recent article from U.S. News that I actually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com -------------------------------------------- http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020916/misc/16meltdown.htmDefrosting the pastAncient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bounty of a warming worldBY ALEX MARKELSAs he hiked near Colorado's Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, Ed Knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000 feet. ""It looked like a bison skull,"" the building contractor and amateur archaeologist recalls. ""I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don't live this high up.' ""Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a bisonâ€“one that died about 340 years ago. ""This was an extraordinary discovery,"" says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that it could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. ""There's probably a lot more like it yet to be found.""And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers and snowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru to Alaskaâ€“a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and industryâ€“have shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. As the ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is emerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep freeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky fringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of our predecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.""It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through studying these remains,"" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude archaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic Society. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered in the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old ""Ice Man,"" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have offered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as the ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother Natureâ€“and lootersâ€“take them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they're often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them don't even realize they're ancient.That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in British Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a dead animal. ""It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,"" recalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. ""But when I looked closer I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones.""Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur trapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc bag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed the fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what seemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter lived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long Ago Person Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who may be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human from the period ever found in North America.Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could explain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the first place. ""Before this there was no archaeological record of people living here,"" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. ""Now we see that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities.""Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband, Gerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south Yukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in caribou dung. ""It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't been caribou in the area for at least 100 years,"" recalls Kuzyk, then a wildlife biologist with the Yukon government.Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found ""what looked like a pencil with string wrapped around it."" It turned out to be a 4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the ice patchâ€“and scores of others around the regionâ€“revealed icy layer cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800 years of changing hunting practices.Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies. Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded some equipment in the ice. ""We've got people hunting with throwing darts up until 1,200 years ago,"" says Hare, who now oversees the research project. ""Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about 1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwing darts.""Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangell and St. Elias mountain rangesâ€“the United States' most glaciated terrainâ€“and in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing European Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as the Ice Man. ""Global warming is providing us high-altitude archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We're probably about the only ones happy about it.""",Safe Email

since the i386 was the CMOV introduced with the Pentium Pro. gcc 2.95 
will use that instruction if directed to with -march=pentiumpro and you 
will generally get a few percent improvement out of it. Code compiled 
with that option will fail on Pentium and earlier processors.> The Pentium also

generated by the compiler such that they make best use of the parallel 
(""superscalar"") pipelines present in a modern CPU. gcc 2.95 has a fair 
go at scheduling according to the -mcpu=pentium/pentiumpro option. gcc 
3.1 does a better job, and fine tunes for a few more processors such as 
athlon and athlon-xp. They're in the process of replacing the compiler's 
instruction scheduling with a whole new mechanism that should do an even 
better job, but that's a ways down the road yet in gcc 3.3.As for the exotic extra instructions sets, gcc 3.1 will make use of SSE 
or SSE2 instructions instead of 387 instructions if you use the 
-mfpmath=sse option and you may see some speed benefit from it, but 
there's a chance you may also see incompatibilities. gcc will still use 
i387 code for missing functionality in the SSE instruction set (double 
precision floats for example).AFAIK no current gcc will ever use MMX or 3DNOW! instructions though gcc 
3.1 enables user code to explicitly generate these instructions with C 
code. The kernel sometimes uses these instruction sets to get super-fast 
block copies of memory or RAID math but not much else.> Not sure what improvements the P4 introduce? I think it's mostly just speed 
> improvements rather than any execution changes.P4 introduced SSE2, a _MUCH_ improved version of SSE and a viable 
replacement for i387 FPU code. SSE supports only single precision floats 
while SSE2 can handle doubles. MMX and SSE shared registers with the FPU 
which hobbles them a bit, but SSE2 has its own large, dedicated register 
file. So far P4 is the only CPU equipped with SSE2. AMD's x86-64 CPUs 
are said to have it as well. Of course x86-64 itself is a whole other 
ball game...Paul.--

"Ripped fromhttp://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Linux.Wireless.usage.html"" 11 Access Points, Home Gateways and Ethernet bridging
Most Access Points act as a MAC level bridge, allowing the Wireless LAN to 
be a natural extension of a wired network. They are deployed in a cellular 
fashion, and provide extended security, management and roaming.
On the other hand, the Home Gateways allow a single cell to be connected to 
a WAN, like a modem, a cable modem or a DSL access. The set of features is 
quite different, and they offer NAT/masquerading and PPP configuration.The conventional Ethernet bridging method (promiscuous sniffing) doesn't 
work with most wireless LAN standard, because of the header encapsulation 
and the interactions with link layer retransmissions. In other word, most 
often, when you use a software bridge on a wireless LAN (such as the Linux 
bridge on a 802.11 card), it doesn't work (moreover, quite often promiscuous 
is broken as well). ""[[ What the?? What is he talking about?? Aren't we all using Linux to bridge 
our networks? ]]"" The driver could work around this restriction by creating its own MAC 
headers (802.11 headers instead of 802.3, and putting the right bits in the 
right place), but in fact most vendors don't provide the specification on 
how to this with their hardware (when they don't explicitely prevent it in 
hardware, to force you to buy their Access Points).In other words, don't expect to use your Linux PC as a wireless bridge or 
wireless Access Points with most products out there, and forget about 
turning it into an Access Point. Of course, there is some exceptions. ""[[ Is this true? ]]
"" The workaround is to set the wireless LAN in ad-hoc mode and to use other 
methods, such as routing, masquerading, IP bridging, ARP proxying... ""
[[ Yes, I am in a process of building a wireless-lan <-> wired-lan bridge. 
But I don't understand what this guy is talking about. Anyone?

Remove the floppy disk cable from the mobo, the ide cables from the mobo... essentially leaving only a video card... ram and a keyboard plugged in.Turn on the system. If it doesn't POST then, switch it off and remove the video card.Switch it back on ... if your mobo doesn't emit some beeps complaining about lack of video card then.Switch it off. Remove it's ram.Same procedure as above.If you still don't have any kind of mobo beep codes then you can try as a last ditch effort to reseat the cpu... (remembering to never ever ever power up your system without a heatsink & fan).If after reseating the cpu into the mobo... you still get no beep codes, from it with just the cpu inserted into the mobo ie(no pci,*isa cards or and no actual ide or floppy cables connected to the system)... even though you have power... you either have a faulty motherboard or a faulty cpu.Once you get beep codes various permutations of the above should eventually disjunct which device it is, is causing the lack of POST.

"" the number of class members will be huge , "" says maurice pesso , a lawyer at a new york firm that has filed a claim . there are , however , limits to the company ' s liability . it has already restated its results going back five years , but federal law restricts litigation to the past three . moreover , enron will not take the rap alone . its auditor , arthur andersen ( now plain andersen ) , is also named as a defendant in at least one of the complaints already filed . the litigation comes after a rough decade for andersen . it has had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements after sloppy audits on such companies as waste management , sunbeam and discovery zone . because enron evolved from an energy company into a financial firm , it became much like an unregulated bank . the lack of supervision meant that the role of the company ' s auditor was crucial . andersen was certainly paid as if it was . in 2000 , it collected $ 25 m for auditing enron ' s books and another $ 27 m for consulting services . now how do you account for that ? copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c did ken lay understand what was happening at enron ? by floyd norris 11 / 16 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company what a tangled web was weaved by enron . both investors and managers seem to have been misled . ' ' enron became overleveraged , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said this week , adding that things went wrong in ways that ' ' i could not have ever contemplated . ' ' he pointed to investments that ' ' performed far worse than we ever could have imagined . ' ' that was the first time that enron had admitted it had a leverage problem , and it came only after the brutal reality had become apparent to many others . mr . lay says he understood what was going on , but i suspect he had left crucial details to others who have since departed and did not fully grasp the reality that was obscured by enron ' s soothing financial statements . when enron was riding high , it could easily have sold stock to raise capital that it now desperately wants . mr . lay and other executives sold stock , but the company did not . just a month ago , mr . lay spoke enthusiastically of how great the company ' s continuing earnings were . the leverage was not easy to find . a lot of it was carried off enron ' s balance sheet . partnerships and special - purpose entities that enron set up borrowed money and funneled the cash to enron . enron guaranteed the debt but did not have to show it on its own balance sheet because it could meet its obligations by issuing stock . as undisclosed losses built up in those entities , it became more likely they could not pay their bills , leaving enron to do so . it is also clear that the bond rating agencies did not understand enron ' s plight until the last couple of weeks . when they figured it out , it took a $ 1 . 5 billion equity infusion that is part of the dynegy takeover to keep enron ' s rating above junk level . now enron has a board committee investigating various transactions , and promises to release details as they are uncovered . officials speak as if they are learning what happened for the first time , and perhaps they are . jeffrey skilling , mr . lay ' s protege , was enron ' s chief financial engineer until he quit this summer . and enron ' s chief financial officer and treasurer were ousted as enron unraveled . some investors would say none of that matters now , that the only important fact is that dynegy is buying enron anyway . chuck watson , dynegy ' s chief executive , is convinced that enron ' s energy trading business is a gem that more than justifies the price dynegy is paying . he figures the losses from the bad investments can be contained . the big question now may be whether mr . watson will retain his enthusiasm after his people study enron ' s trading positions . enron has always said it hedged its big derivative positions - - positions that can contain huge leverage that does not show up on the balance sheet - - but some of that hedging was with affiliated companies . if big surprises are found , dynegy could back out of the deal . there is plenty of blame to go around here , and suits have been filed against enron , its current and former officials , and its auditor , arthur andersen . but investors also bear responsibility . enron ' s financial statements were , as mr . lay conceded this week , ' ' opaque and difficult to understand . ' ' investors and analysts knew they did not know what was going on . they bought anyway . enron was viewed as a company that always made its numbers . an old - line gas pipeline company had been transformed into a brilliant trader that could apply its magic around the world . investors did not care how enron made the numbers . now , when it is too late , they do . graph tracks the monthly closes of enron ' s stock price from 1998 through 2001 . yesterday ' s close : $ 9 . 48 copyright ? 2000 dow jones section a a quick change in fortune dulls the glimmer of houston by jim yardley 11 / 16 / 2001 the new york times page 14 , column 1 c . 2001 new york times company houston , nov . 15 - - on a day when oil prices plunged to two - year lows , when the hometown enron corporation continued its ugly free fall and when gloomy projections showed the local economy headed for a decidedly rough patch , george alcorn lunched on chilean sea bass at the downtown petroleum club and decided that the sky was not falling . ' ' i ' ve been an optimist all my life , ' ' said mr . alcorn , 69 , who owns an independent exploration company and survived the oil bust years of the mid - 1980 ' s . ' ' the opportunities in this town have always been large . i don ' t think it ' s going to change at all . ' ' that mr . alcorn could sound upbeat in such seemingly grim economic times is hardly surprising in a city largely built on pluck and buoyant optimism . until recently , economists had predicted that the economic downturn plaguing the rest of the nation would largely bypass houston , the nation ' s energy capital . in june , the economist magazine , citing houston ' s increasingly diverse economy , even promoted it as a candidate for the world ' s next great international city and business center . but june is a long time ago . by then , the city had already lost 2 , 000 jobs from the struggling computer maker compaq and will probably now lose thousands more if the company ' s merger with hewlett - packard is approved . in the aftermath of the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , continental airlines , which is based here , announced 12 , 000 layoffs , some likely to come in houston . the texas medical center , one of the largest medical complexes in the world , is facing financial peril after flooding in june caused an estimated $ 2 billion in damages . the latest blow to the economy as well as the local psyche is the plight of enron , the energy company that some analysts said tottered near bankruptcy before a merger with its local rival , dynegy , was announced last week . even if the merger goes through , the city is expected to feel a crunch ; local real estate analysts say the merger could produce a glut of downtown office space at a time when new towers are under construction , including one by enron . one visible symbol of the changing fortunes is that two of the city ' s sports stadiums , enron field and compaq center , are named for companies that soon may not exist . this week , the national association of purchasing management , which measures business activity and industrial production , released a report showing that houston ' s economy had contracted in october after 32 consecutive months of expansion . ' ' over the first half of this year , you had to feel pretty good , ' ' said bill gilmer , an economist at the federal reserve bank of dallas and an authority on houston . but mr . gilmer said that much of the city ' s recent job growth was driven by oil and gas companies and that the decline in prices meant the sector was ' ' running out of steam . ' ' ' ' the national economy , ' ' mr . gilmer added , ' ' is not helping out right now . ' ' the fact that the ailing national economy is dragging on houston is , oddly enough , evidence of the city ' s success in recovering from the 1980 ' s oil bust . then , with the local economy dominated by oil and gas , the drop in prices crushed the city and prompted civic leaders to preach economic diversification . and it worked : compaq , continental , the texas medical center as well as dramatic growth in small business helped houston recover and grow even faster , becoming the nation ' s fourth - largest city . the new generation of sophisticated energy companies , led by enron , then created a boom . economists say the next several months are likely to be slow . there could be substantial layoffs if compaq and enron mergers take place . mr . gilmer said the price of oil still played a large role in the city ' s economy ; the number of exploration rigs has dropped to roughly 1 , 000 from about 1 , 300 in recent months . yet no one is predicting a reprise of the bust , when downtown office buildings stood practically empty . instead , economists point to a relatively quick rebound . ray perryman , a texas economist who runs the perryman group , said houston still had an infrastructure envied by most other cities , including the city ' s bustling port , the nation ' s second largest . the city was recently named as one of four finalists to become the american entry to be host of the 2012 olympic games . voters recently approved construction of a starter light rail line , and federal environmental officials recently signed off on a plan to greatly reduce air pollution . ' ' we ' re sitting here with over two million jobs , ' ' said former mayor bob lanier . the downfall of enron , though , a company whose value dropped almost 90 percent because of accounting problems and financial distress , has been the most highly publicized and unexpected blow to the city ' s economy . the company had embodied the self - image that houston business leaders hold dear : it was entrepreneurial , aggressive and ground breaking . it was also a generous civic benefactor ; the company ' s chairman , kenneth l . lay , a close friend of president bush , had even been rumored as a potential mayoral candidate . but this week , enron ' s lost glory became painfully evident . in a hall at rice university on tuesday , mr . lay presented alan greenspan , the federal reserve chairman , with a lifetime achievement award , the enron prize , which mr . lay ' s company had endowed and named in flush times . the next morning , an article in the houston chronicle said no decision had been made on whether the name of the prize would be changed . photos : compaq center , home of the n . b . a . houston rockets , is named for a company that soon may not exist . enron , above , may soon be acquired by a rival energy company .

( operating cash flow at cablevision is defined as operating profit before depreciation and amortization . ) insurance will cover some of the cost of the johnson - longley payouts . ' ' the team looks healthy , ' ' jim dolan , the president of cablevision , said on tuesday during a conference call with analysts . ' ' i don ' t expect any more write - offs . ' ' whether that turns out to be true depends on whether any currently hearty player sustains a career - ending injury . but cablevision could have avoided this financial circumstance had it paid attention to the physical conditions of johnson and longley . in each case , the garden knew it was acquiring damaged goods . in his second season in charlotte , johnson hurt his back , and he has never been the same . maybe the garden was swayed that he was well enough , because he averaged 20 . 5 points and 8 . 4 rebounds in the season before it traded anthony mason for him . but the persistence of his back problems in the last few seasons attests to the riskiness of getting him in the first place . the back compromised his skills , often limiting him to being a symbol of the knicks ' grit . he also spelled ' ' l ' ' with his bended arm quite nicely , yet not worth an average of $ 7 million a year . when longley arrived from phoenix last year in the four - team deal that sent patrick ewing to seattle , he said he had told the knicks that he had a degenerative ankle condition . ' ' i brought up my ankle in my physical with the knicks , ' ' he said in july , ' ' and they said , ' have you been playing ? ' i said , ' yes , ' and that was it .

"" it ' s in our best interest to involve them . this project is a large project , and certainly westcoast and transcanada would have been stretched to do it by ourselves , "" said mr . birch , who is also the co - chief executive officer of foothills pipe lines ltd . a joint venture co - owned by westcoast and transcanada . foothills holds the regulatory permits to the proposed alaska highway pipeline . mr . birch said the equity position of each company in the project is still to be worked out . rocco cianco , a foothills spokesman , said that is in part because some of the companies are in a state of flux . westcoast is in the process of being taken over by duke , while houston - based enron is in the process of being bought by hometown rival dynegy corp . the partnership brings back to the table all nine of the original participants in a similar pipeline project that was proposed in the 1970 s and shelved because of weakening commodity prices and native opposition . mr . birch noted that it also removes a legal question hanging over the pipeline project , of whether the six u . s . companies had any claim on the project based on their capital investment in the 1970 s project . they withdrew from that project on the understanding that if it was to restart , they would be able to recover that initial investment , which some have pegged at up to $ 4 - billion including interest , he said . in getting back on board , the six companies have agreed to waive that claim , he said . scott kent , the minister of economic development for yukon , a vocal proponent of the proposed pipeline , said the removal of the legal question lifts a huge barrier to the project . "" there was a chance this could have ended up in a lengthy court battle that would have significantly hampered "" the project , he said . "" it ' s certainly very good news .

"" everybody and his and her uncle wants to be in this pipeline , there ' s so many ' me toos ' that they just want to position themselves , "" he said . the market understanding is that the alaska producers , which include exxon mobil corp . , phillips petroleum co . , bp amoco plc and chevron corp . , will ultimately decide who will build and operate a pipeline because the cost of such a project would be recovered from them in the form of pipeline tolls . gina taylor , a spokeswoman for enron , said the partners got together with an eye on approaching producers to get an answer from them on whether the project can go ahead . "" marketplace approval is key to us moving forward with this , "" she said . "" that ' s why we put the [ memorandum ] in place , so we could go out and revisit with the producers . "" but curtis thayer , a spokesman for the alaska producers , said it is too early to talk about who will build or operate the pipeline , because his group has not even decided to proceed with one yet . he noted that a preliminary analysis done as part of a $ 100 - million study the group has undertaken indicates a pipeline couldn ' t pay for itself at current commodity prices . however , no decision has been made , he insisted . some of the other options floated include building a pipeline off the north shore of alaska and yukon to gas fields in the northwest territories , then down the mackenzie valley of the nwt , or a pipeline going over land in yukon to the nwt . there are various backers for each proposal and the alaskan producers have not ruled out undertaking a project themselves . joe handley , the minister of finance for the nwt , said news of the partnership is a spur to participants in the proposed mackenzie valley pipeline . the territory ' s government has consistently said an nwt pipeline must be built first or risk being derailed by an alaska pipeline that would flood the market with product .

"" the economic benefits of this multi - billion dollar project would impact most regions of the u . s . and canada , "" said mike stewart , co - chief executive officer of foothills pipe lines . foothills reached the agreement with transcanada pipelines , westcoast energy and american companies williams , duke energy , el paso corp . , enron , pg & e corp . and sempra energy international . the groups comprise the original alaskan northwest natural gas transportation company which had first proposed building this project in the 1970 s . under the terms of the agreement , the companies plan to dismiss $ 4 billion in costs and interest associated with the dormant project that would have been charged to developers of the pipeline . the money represents their original investment , with interest . "" their intention is to remove that as an issue , "" said foothills spokesman rocco ciancio . that was seen as a key roadblock to building an all - alaska pipeline to the lower 48 by officials with the state , which would own 12 . 5 percent of any natural gas pumped out of the north slope . "" now that that ' s been resolved , it ' s time the producers come to the table with pipeline companies , the state of alaska and other players to get this project underway , "" said gov . tony knowles . exxon mobil , phillips and bp have spent millions studying the viability of the project and , so far , have determined it is not profitable . knowles and other state officials have been pressuring the oil companies to build a route that generally follows the trans - alaska oil pipeline and the alaska highway to alberta . it would provide jobs for alaskans , cheap natural gas to communities and revenues for state services , knowles said . but canadian officials have pushed for a beaufort sea route that taps into rich reserves stranded in the mackenzie delta . the oil companies estimate the canadian route would cost $ 15 . 1 billion compared to the alaska highway route , which would cost $ 17 billion . ciancio said his group estimates a pipeline would cost $ 9 . 7 billion to construct and would get the natural gas to market quicker than other proposals . the consortium has held permits to build the all - alaska route since 1976 . "" we ' re estimating it would take a greenfield ( start up ) project somewhere near two to three years to reach the same state of readiness as this project , "" ciancio said . the consortium ' s project proposes running a 42 - inch pipe from prudhoe bay to alberta where the companies have other pipelines to ship natural gas to chicago and san francisco , he said . if agreements are reached quickly with the oil companies , the pipeline could be in operation by 2008 , ciancio said . a spokesman for the oil producers team which is studying the project greeted the news and said it would welcome any pipeline plan that would be profitable .

"" while janus again cut sharply into its stake in sun - dropping 14 . 7 million shares - its holdings of cisco and oracle were nearly unchanged in the quarter , the filing showed . janus also cut about 12 . 6 million shares of advanced micro devices inc . . on the other hand , the company added some 13 . 6 million shares of microsoft corp . and boosted its stakes in jds uniphase and ebay inc . . the funds also more than doubled their holdings in berkshire hathaway inc . to 320 , 691 shares . the filing showed that janus made almost no change in the third quarter to its holding of enron corp . , the energy trading company whose stock collapsed amid a u . s . regulatory probe . at the end of the quarter , janus held 41 . 36 million shares in enron . the janus spokeswoman would not comment on the enron shares , but said that the filings are dated and don ' t necessarily reflect current holdings . shares of enron plunged in mid - october as investors rebelled over the company ' s off - the - balance - sheet deals that are now under investigation . enron whose stock is off 63 percent so far in the fourth quarter . the company agreed last week to be acquired by smaller rival dynegy inc . for about $ 9 billion in stock . janus ' s stake in exxon mobil corp . more than doubled to 39 . 8 million shares in the quarter . janus ' s stock holdings were worth $ 102 . 09 billion at the end of the quarter , down from $ 141 . 05 billion at the end of the second quarter . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . cash infusion little comfort to enron counterparties by andrew dowell of dow jones newswires 11 / 15 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - one and a half billion dollars doesn ' t go as far as it used to . despite a cash injection of that size from dynegy inc . ( dyn ) this week , u . s . energy companies continue to restrict their dealings with enron corp . ( ene ) , traders in the u . s . power and natural gas markets said wednesday . traders said they were doing deals with the houston - based energy giant when necessary , and some reported that activity appears to have picked up . but traders said they were continuing to limit their exposure and doing business with other parties if possible until enron ' s credit rating improves . "" it ' s a company with one foot on a banana peel and one foot in the grave , "" said ed kennedy , a miami - based trader with pioneer futures . both moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s rate enron one notch above speculative grade . moody ' s has enron ' s ratings on review for a downgrade , and s & p has enron on negative credit watch . enron ' s ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment - grade ratings . tuesday ' s infusion of cash from dynegy , which has agreed to buy enron in a stock - swap currently worth about $ 10 billion , isn ' t enough to change the outlook for enron , said todd shipman , a director in the u . s . utilities group at s & p . instead , the firm will be watching to see whether enron can hold on to its core business of trading north american gas and power . if it does , s & p may revisit enron ' s credit - watch status after new year ' s with an eye to upgrading it to "" positive , "" shipman said . circular reasoning that sets up a staredown of sorts between the ratings agency and the energy markets , with each waiting for the other to take the first step . "" it always has been a sort of face - off , "" shipman said . "" for the time being , we ' re standing pat unless the situation at enron gets significantly worse . "" moody ' s wasn ' t immediately available for comment . traders and their companies said consistently that until enron ' s credit ratings improve , they will continue to watch their exposure to enron carefully , with trades limited to short - term deals . mirant corp . ( mir ) is trading with enron on "" a very limited basis "" that won ' t be broadened until enron ' s credit situation improves , spokesman chuck griffin said . aquila corp . ( ila ) ceo keith stamm said the company was heartened by dynegy ' s injection of cash and was continuing to monitor enron ' s condition . "" the $ 1 . 5 billion has improved their situation with us , and we ' ll keep watching the situation , "" stamm said . on monday , aquila said it had whittled down its exposure to enron significantly . enron spokesman eric thode said 30 - day - moving - average volumes on enrononline , the internet - based trading platform on which enron is the counterparty in every deal , have improved to a more typical 5 , 700 transactions per day with a notional value of $ 2 . 7 billion . "" volumes have returned to the normal range , "" he said . some traders said enron ' s short - term business does appear to have picked up from earlier this week . staffing changes a concern enron is the country ' s largest trader of natural gas and electricity , accounting for up to a quarter of both markets by some estimates . even when companies aren ' t prohibiting their traders from doing business with enron , some traders are taking steps on their own to limit exposure . one funds analyst said the possibility of staffing changes at enron are contributing to traders ' reluctance to do business with the company . "" you have headhunters out there , "" the analyst said . "" why tie yourself down with a five - year deal with someone who may not be there ? "" enron currently employes about 1 , 500 people in its trading operation , and dynegy employes some 300 . the acquisition is expected to produce cuts , but dynegy hasn ' t said to what degree . energy companies began shying away from enron over the past month , as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75 % drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with distressed debt . enron ' s restatement of four and a half years ' worth of earnings last thursday and ratings downgrades friday led some companies to severely restrict their business with enron , even if that meant paying higher prices or accepting lower bids to do so . enron ' s ability to recover that business is critical to its future , s 201 - 938 - 4430 ; andrew . dowell @ dowjones . com ( john edmiston in houston , jon kamp in chicago and mark golden in new york contributed to this article . ) copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dynegy may want some of enron ' s broadband assets by erwin seba of dow jones newswires 11 / 15 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) houston - ( dow jones ) - enron corp .

"" i ' ve not been given any definitive information , "" a trader said . traders and brokers who are counterparties to enron said enron ' s traders remain active in the bandwidth market , regularly showing prices for various contracts . dynegy traders are also present in the market , but not as pervasively as enron traders have been , said one broker . dynegy ' s traders regularly show a high offer price without presenting a bid price , a broker said . usually dynegy traders will stay with that high offer expecting buyers in the market to come to them . also , the broker said , dynegy seems most active with contracts on the new york - miami route . in addition to deciding what to do with enron ' s network , dynegy also faces decisions about whether to retain enron ' s bandwidth traders and the contracts the company still holds for bandwidth services . guiding dynegy ' s decisions will be a continuing commitment to its own bandwidth strategy . "" dynegy has been focused on building very long - term customer relationships , "" rosser said . "" we are focused , just as we have been in our energy business , on being a value - added provider to our customers . we have maintained a focus on the wholesale market . . . and large enterprise consumers of bandwidth . we have maintained focus on structured transactions and not trading , primarily because we don ' t think a true trading environment exists yet .

"status vasant - i hope you had a wonderful vacation back home , and are rested and recovered from the long flight back . i wanted to give you an update of the eol project , the gas model , and of my intentions here at enron . software ( in compiled c on the unix platform ) has been developed and debugged to listen to the eol trades , process them , book them , and file them away . in addition , software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on a continual basis , and to store the entirety of open positions on eol in a dynamic matrix facilitating analysis . it has yet to get back with me on how the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit purposes . these data files are stored in a format for reading by excel or by sas , for which i have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines elucidating the structure of the data . i am in the process of documenting all of this for you . with regards the gas model and its slow performance on the compaq , dell has agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the compaq , to see if the performance issue of the lp is related to the compaq . i have been researching this issue with it here and with compaq and dell . the new machine will be here any day now ( no financial obligation to anyone ) , and i will be able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is compaq - specific . i am also in the process of documenting the gas model for you . i ' ve tried to do my best for you , vasant , but i have been frustrated by not only the death of my mother but some internal systems in it here . just the other day , sas could not open a full query of the eol database because there wasn ' t enough free space on the server ' s hard drive for the workfiles . in discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power trading , people whom i have known for over 10 years , they indicated they were ubiquitous here . the power traders have similar pc ' s to my new one , and they have complained from day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones . also , there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses ; during my brief tenure here it has gone through two differing proposals as to how to address this . when i have been told of tools available for real - time data harvesting , my requests for such have typically been met with "" well , we have it , but we haven ' t really tested it yet . "" an example is the weather : we still do not record to disk the hourly nws observations from the goes satellite . my interests here are to help enron to do well , because i will do well only if enron does well . these aren ' t empty words - my ira is 100 % invested in the enron stock fund . i believe my best contributions to enron will be in the areas of systems as well as modeling , and the difficulty working in the research group , in terms of systems development , is that , frankly , few people at enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems . we aren ' t directly generating revenues for enron , and we aren ' t really their customers , except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses . as it happens , power trading posted an opening for a modeling and forecasting person , and i spoke with them and they asked me to take the job , reporting to george hopley . it is a wonderful opportunity for me , vasant , as they are interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their traders ' access to real - time fundamentals data . i was completely candid with kevin presto regarding my shortcomings here in research - i told him you were disgusted with me because i repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines . they also understand i have yet to be at enron for 1 year , and thus may only bid on a job with your permission . we agree the move is good for enron ; we all work for enron , and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but merely permit it . they are comfortable with me - they have known me for years as a hard worker , honest and unpretensive . they have already ordered a state - of - the - art unix workstation and server for me , and they have told me they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful , including hiring an analyst to work for me . and , i have already been able to teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis i have learned here . so , i am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening . it would be a lateral move in position and salary , and i would commit to you to help you in any way possible in the future with regards the gas model or the eol database . i will continue to work on their improvement , and complete their documentation . as it happens , i am away on enron business in portland monday and tuesday , and will be back wednesday . i had wanted to talk face - to - face instead of by email , but enron business supercedes - i am on a team designing the data warehouse for floor trader support . clayton .",Safe Email

between those ""in poverty"" and those who
are more affluent than ""working class"".I don't know what poverty officially is,
but from a CA perspective, $15k income is
not going to go far.  At current interest
rates, one would probably want somewhere
around $500k* wealth to throw that amount,
which pretty much limits the non-working
class to a small, single-digit percentage
of households.  (how much overlap do we
have with the retirement cohort here?)The 2000 numbers pretty much confirm it:shows that the top 5% of incomes are mostly
two+-earner households, and the zero-earner 
households are rare above median incomes.
We are the workers' paradise.The census figured $18k as the cutoff for
lowest 5th, so with that as a poverty line,

legislation simply says that lying

a matter of cheating the accounts,

"next of kin [ business ] goodday , i am frenkel heydorn , staff of smith came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division . he informed us that he had a financial portfolio of thirty million united states dollars , which he wished to have us turn over ( invest ) on his behalf . i was the officer assigned to his case , i made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de - facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector , especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank . we met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed . i encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings . the favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments . based on my advice , we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation , the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over ten million united states dollars , this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments . in mid 2001 , he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the united kingdom . he directed that i liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm . i informed him that smith & williamson would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process , the bank would have to make a 9 . 5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges . he complained about the charges but later came around when i explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us . cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9 / 11 . i contacted my affiliate and made the funds available to the security firm . i undertook all the processes and made sure i followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited with the security firm . the security firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash . this small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well - connected organizations . in line with instructions , the money was deposited with the security firm . the deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from norway later that week . this was the last communication we had , this transpired around 25 th february 2003 . in june last year , we got a call from the security firm informing us that the inactivity of that particular portfolio . this was an astounding position as far as i was concerned , given the fact that i managed the private banking sector i was the only one who knew about the deposit at the security firm , and i could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his deposit . i made futile efforts to locate the deceased . i immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of smith depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous . this bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself , ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said , rarely do they nominate next of kin . private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care , in this case ; the deceased died without a testate . in line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away , we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate . this investigation has for the past months been unfruitful . we have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem . it is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased . my official capacity dictates that i am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation . what this means , you being the last batch of names we have considered , is that our dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable family member . this leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit . according to practice , the security firm will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to smith & williamson , failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to smith & williamson . this will result in the money entering the smith & williamson accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division . this will not happen if i have my way . what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something . it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational . the world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios . you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what i propose . there is thirty million dollars deposited in a security firm , i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless i instruct them to do so . i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as smith they have investigated for months and have found no family . the investigation has come to an end . my proposal ; you share the same surname with our late client ; i am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the security firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation . upon receipt of the deposit , i am prepared to share the money with you in half . that is : i will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you . we share the proceeds 50 / 50 . i would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me , but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit . but on the other hand , you with the same very name as the original depositor would easily pass as the beneficiary with right to claim . i assure you that i could have the deposit released to you within a few days . i will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased i will then officially communicate with the security firm and instruct them to release the deposit to you . with these two things : all is done . the alternative would be for us to have the security firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder . this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the security company . we can fine - tune this based on our interactions . i am aware of the consequences of this proposal . i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail . i ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive . if my offer is of no appeal to you , delete this message and forget i ever contacted you . do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal . you may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector . i am not a criminal and what i do , i do not find against good conscience , this may be hard for you to understand , but the dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move . such opportunities only come ones ' way once in a lifetime . i cannot let this chance pass me by , for once i find myself in total control of my destiny . these chances wont pass me by . i ask that you do not destroy my chance , if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me . i am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities . there is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking . i have evaluated the risks and the only risk i have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank . i am the only one who knows of this situation , good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life . lets share the blessing . if you find yourself able to work with me , contact me through this email account if you give me positive signals , i will initiate this process towards a conclusion . i wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels ; i will deny knowing you and about this project . i repeat , i do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do i want you contacting me through my official email account . contact me only through the numbers i will provide for you and also through this email address . i do not want any direct link between you and me . my official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our total quality management policy . please observe this instruction religiously . please , again , note i am a family man , i have a wife and children . i send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences , but i know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold . this is the one truth i have learned from my private banking clients . do not betray my confidence . i await your response . frenkel heydorn . mail sent from webmail service at php - nuke powered site fanghaowen . com - http : / / fanghaowen . com",Phishing Email

xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXThank you for your interest!Judgment Courses offers an extensive training
course in ""How to Collect MoneyJudgments""If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income .If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.""The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoney
Judgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5more
Judgments take its place.We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.The income potential is substantial in this profession. We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time .One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)Quote's from several of our students:Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .Your
professionalism in both the manual and your support.  
You have the video opened doors for me in the future. 
There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states 
he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on""After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us: ""I am now making $2,000.00 per
week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now""After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
""I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help out""Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months"">From the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:With our course you can own your own successful business.
A business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. A business which is
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
day is new and exciting.None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen
for many others already. Make it happen for you!If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.Please call us at 1-2`8`1-5`0`0-4`0`1`8.We have Service Support staff available to you from 8:00am to
10:00pm (Central Time) 7 days a week . If you callthis number
you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.
They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person
can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not.Thank you for your time and interest.

">>From the BBC website - www.bbc.co.uk Tuesday, 8 October, 2002, 09:43 GMT 10:43 UK  Fake bank website cons victims
 
 West African criminals have used a fake version of a British bank's online
 service to milk victims of cash, say police. The fake site was used to squeeze
 more money out of people they had already hooked. 
 
 The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service,
 (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being
 taken in by the fake website. 
 
 The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a
 share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African
 nations. 
 
 NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would
 otherwise spot the scam. 
 
 Convincing site 
 
 News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an
 unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out
 their victims.  A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had ""the"" in
 front of the bank's name. 
 
 ""I have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated,"" said the NCIS
 spokesman. ""It's very convincing especially to people not very experienced
 online."" 
 
 Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people
 behind it have not been caught. 
 
 NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. 
 
 The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many
 other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again.  Domain games 
 
 Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or
 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any
 cash successfully moved out of Africa. 
 
 The '419' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such
 crimes. 
 
 Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking
 the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe
 uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. 
 
 Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to
 it. 
 
 NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in
 London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. 
 
 Cutting edge fraud 
 
 Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of
 legitimacy. 
 
 
 People tricked into clicking on fake sites
 
 But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in
 place of the certificates. 
 
 ""To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web
 technology,"" said the spokesman. 
 
 One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website
 that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African
 Reserve Bank, the country's national bank. 
 
 Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to
 visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has
 been deposited in their name. 
 
 But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically
 asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. 
 
 Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national
 priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. 
 
 Modern gloss 
 
 An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that
 criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give
 old cons a modern gloss. 
 
 The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come
 forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two
 months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. 
 
 He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be
 true, undoubtedly is. 
 
 One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment
 service Paypal. 
 
 Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account
 and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. 
 
 The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed
 people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use.

By Dale Franks 10/08/2002
For over two generations, the countries of Western Europe have been our
closest allies. We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the
Cold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We
celebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation
of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that
Hudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed ""progressive
transnationalism"". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist
progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the
deconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of
citizenship (i.e. a ""global"" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and
the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the
United Nations.The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the
pooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there
is a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelected
European Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits
to their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where
elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an
appointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy,
whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover,
the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of
the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired
by the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice
regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member
governments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development.European criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of
complaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact
that our republican system of government is not based on proportional
representation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise
the fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy
is so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear
- the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere
in the world.On August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK's Independent
newspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be
restrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decade
or so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because it
exaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather because
the impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of
the US literally fantastic.At least, for now.Despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact
remains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European
intellectual and political elite.The Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in
check the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such a
system in Europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. America,
however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannot
understand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national
sovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it
does on compliance with international ""norms."" They view all departures
from such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equal
vote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the
process is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The trouble
with this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic,
authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic
societies. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.Thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals
to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the
liberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because its
dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated references
to the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to
comply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume,
therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a
commitment to
constitutional rights.None of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, or
cooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in
favor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, while
their tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such a
political atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably
increase.That thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is the
thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the
new ideology of transnational progressivism.

On conclusion of this business, I shall compensate you with 45% of the fund, while 5% is mapped out for any expense we should encounter during the cause of transaction, and the remaining amount should be used to open account for my family for investment over there with your assistance.

Sounds like you are talking about setting up a company, to be a vendor....
I'd venture the early days of Debian, Slackware and other involveds there
was no such financing.--

Oh.  OK.
 
These results don't help break EC crypto at all.
 
With RSA, you pick a number with secret factors and to break the
cryptosystem, you can factor the number.  Due to fast sub-exponential
algorithms for factoring, the number had better be 1024 bits at the
very least (record = 524 bits).
 
With EC, you pick a curve and pick points on the curve with secret
discrete logarithm.  To break the cryptosystem you can compute a
discrete log but the best algorithms for random curves are exponential
(record = 109 bits, for a slightly special curve).
 
Up until now, people pick curves chosen from a small fixed set.  One
choice is a few curves with special properties that originally were
chosen to make point-counting easier, and can also speed up the crypto
operations, but in some cases they can also speed up attacks, not on
curves deployed at the moment but the danger exists.  The other
choice is to precompute a handful of random curves.  The NSA did this
a few years ago when it took hours on a fast machine and NIST
standardized those curves.
 
What changes is that it is now possible is to generate your own curves
on an ordinary PC.  This has been getting easier and easier, with
small curves taking seconds on a fast machine since a year or two.
Now even reasonably big curves take seconds on a typical PC.
 
This means that you don't have to rely on standard curves but can
distribute risk over many curves in case some get broken at some
stage.  In certain circumstances you can even keep the curve itself
secret so an attacker doesn't know which discrete log to try to
compute!  There isn't really a good analogy with RSA, but imagine
wanting to factor a number and you don't even know what it is...
 
So basically recent progress has made new things feasible and this
makes them even more so.  The underlying primitives for signing,
encoding and so on are not affected, but the security vibes get better.

"california update 4 / 05 / 01 below is the transcript of an interview conducted yesterday with state treasurer phil angelides : summary : ? bond issuance to be $ 10 b with 10 - 15 year term , 70 % tax exempt and 30 % non - exempt ? angelides in favor of wind fall profit tax ? opposed to current discussion between davis and socal in regards to socal paying off the generators over 12 years with a 2 - year grace period what decisions on rate components are necessary before you can sell bonds ? "" the big things we need are that the puc must enter into agreement with dwr , essentially warranting that sufficient revenues from rates will be available for purchasing power . it is really their job to define what each party needs to pay for power . we need to give assurance to the investment community that whatever the overall rate is , the state will get enough to pay its bonds . however , if the utilities challenge the decision , it could stall the bond issuance . "" what do you think will be the size of the first bond issue ? "" based on what is currently possible and what the legislature has authorized , around $ 10 bn . the puc has allowed us to sell north of $ 13 bn , but we anticipate that $ 10 bn is absorbable . until the administration provides details for this office and the public on what its costs of buying power are and what it needs in terms of funding , what will drive it is that number , not what the puc has said . the issuance may well be a single $ 10 bn issue or a series of smaller ones done together , e . g . $ 3 bn each 3 weeks apart . "" what is the total size of the market for ca tax - exempt bonds ? "" what we do normally is $ 5 - 10 bn in bonds for various revenues or general obligations . in 1997 the ca infrastructure rate reductions bonds was a $ 7 bn issuance , and this was handled well . this is not exclusively a ca market . around $ 200 bn of these bonds is sold each year . we anticipate that the bonds will be 70 % tax - exempt and 30 % non - exempt . "" what is the total of electric supply contracts that are firm enough to require funding ? "" we have estimates . the dwr is buying power , and let ' s say power costs $ 100 and its portion of rates is $ 70 . this bond issuance covers the diff between $ 100 and $ 70 . so , the bond issuance is a way to cover the gap . however , if power prices do not come down , you cannot keep borrowing . if we issue more than $ 10 bn in bonds , i have to see the whole financial plan . ( the implication is that he will not keep this plan secret . ) "" what will be the term mix of the bond issues ? "" overall term is expected to be in the 10 - 15 year range . i do not know the mix . "" do you have the ability to do bridging tax anticipation notes or anything like that to take care of the general fund ? "" the very purpose of the bridge loan is that we are taking a taxable and tax - exempt bridge loan until bonds are issued . in order for us to issue bonds , a number of steps have to occur . i would hope that the puc and dwr do what they have to do realistically by june . then the bond issuance would come semi all - at - once . ( in other words , either all at once , or something like $ 3 billion every three weeks . ) "" are all of the general funds ' assets in cash , or are some in the form of a less liquid receivable ? "" we have a lot of liquidity in real cash in general fund . we have a cash flow . we have the ability in pooled money investment accounts so that we can go out to five years . we have $ 40 bn - plus in that account . "" what is the minimum working capital required in the general fund for day - to - day operations ? "" it depends , and goes up and down . on any given day we are doing on the order of $ 500 mm . there is a $ 100 bn budget between the general funds and special fund . "" are you discussing the dwr contracting in relation to the required funding ? do you have a veto on the deals struck ? "" this is all in the administration ' s court . what we have asked for is the information . we have asked for this today by letter . we have to move from working with 3 or 4 banks to a public offering , which means public disclosure . the general fund has been making advances to buy power , but we want to get out of that business and to stop the $ 4 bn plus drain on general fund from arranging an interim loan . "" what is the credit risk from industry or other large users cherry picking or self - selecting ? "" there are limits on the options out there . ablx has limited the ability of people to opt out of the system . if you do allow them to opt out , what do they have to pay to preserve the revenue stream ? the agreement between the dwr and the puc will say that , through a financing order , we will get you the revenue to service the bonds , even if it adjusts rates . this will be a covenant that the money will be made available . "" if an initiative is launched could it create enough uncertainty to have an effect on abix or the bond issuance ? what about "" harvey proofing "" ? what is the direct state participation ? "" the state ' s role is infrastructure and economic development . bonds will be issued in name of dwr only to pay for power the state is buying , not to repay utility deb . i don ' t think the state will repay utility debt . the state can buy power in or out of chapter 11 . there will be no participation by the state bank . i know harvey well , and he and i agree on a number of things . for example , i am cosponsoring the public power authority . we should not put the state in the business of refinancing utility debt . i don ' t think most consumer groups realize that we are selling bonds to pay for power . i very much want , and it is in my interest , to repay the general fund . at the same time that this office is financing the purchase of energy , the fundamental problem is the price we are being charged by the generators - the ransom that is being demanded by the generators . i agree with harvey that as of this current time the generators are winning . we will have to consider excess profits taxes , or if the generators continue , they have increased their prices tenfold . the generators they bought a set of plants for $ 3 . 1 bn . since january the state has spent over $ 4 bn . if the generators don ' t take their foot off our throat , they may leave us no option but to take back plants under emergency power . so let them justify those rates . what causes the problem is the generators jacking up prices to the point where they will make us do something about it . "" what is the "" measurable size premium "" that will have to be paid based on the most current estimates of bond issue size ? "" measurable is the wrong choice of words . we don ' t know how many basis points . if it is more than $ 10 bn , we will begin to feel it . also , i am not for that proposal to allow the utilities to pay off the generators over 12 years with a 2 - year grace period . they should work that out themselves , not on the backs of ratepayers . the perspective here is that they did very , very well in 1996 , 97 and 98 . they upstreamed billions .
