It has a couple different definitions.  The most common is Luser 
[sic] Attitude Readjustment Tool.  It was first used to describe the 
reporting of spam to ISPs that didn't think spam was bad.  Their 
attitude needed a little readjusting.  It has since taken on the 
generic meaning of reporting email/security incidents to the 
appropriate parties.  Somewhere the definition is online.  I can't 
seem to find the page though.
LART is about as good a word as any to describe reporting 
Rumplestiltskin attacks.  Come to think of it, I generally get a much 
better response to spam LARTs than I do to LARTs for other things. 
I'm always careful to say in the LART that the massive amounts probes 
on our system disrupted service to our customers and that we 
therefore consider it a DoS attack.  That tends to ellict a better 
response.  I also either include a log snippet in the email or I dump 
it to a file and make it accessible on a web server with other logs 
of hosts that abused our mail server.  That helps too. :)Justin

"Hi all,I have a debian machine with an external ISDN terminal adapter, which 
I'm trying to get to dial a Cisco 3600 running CHAP. wvdial on Red Hat 
copes fine with this. However, I get the same results if i use pon or 
wvdial on Debian: pppd negotiation is detected, pppd is started -- and 
I'm never assigned an IP address.Looking at the logs on the Cisco, I see that in place of the username I 
seem to be transmitting a six-digit hex number. e.g.:Aug  8 23:35:00.311 UTC+1: %ISDN-6-CONNECT: Interface Serial0/0:19 is 
now connected to  19eb85The last entry should be my dialup username. (Substitute incoming phone 
number for ).Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?Cheers,

  Japanese Crime Noir in DivX Video
  ---------------------------------  A wide variety of innovative studios and film distributors have
  been using DivX video-on-demand technology to sell downloadable
  DivX titles online since August of last year. One of the many
  interesting films currently available is the Japanese crime
  thriller ""Nobody"" from DivX partner Vanguard Cinema. Called ""a
  triumph"" by the New York Times, ""Nobody"" is an action-packed
  thriller-noir that tells a story of an escalating cycle of
  violence and revenge. In the tradition of international crime
  thrillers like ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""Tokyo Fist,"" ""Nobody"" takes
  the viewer through a labyrinth of suspense and carnage without
  release until the very end.* Watch ""Nobody"" in High-quality DivX Video:

"" chinese translation proved difficult for coke , which took two tries to get it right . they first tried ke - kou - ke - la because when pronounced it sounded roughly like coca - cola . it wasn ' t until after thousands of signs had been printed that they discovered that the phrase means "" bite the wax tadpole "" or "" female horse stuffed with wax , "" depending on the dialect . second time around things worked out much better . after researching 40 , 000 chinese characters , coke came up with "" ko - kou - ko - le "" which translates roughly to the much more appropriate "" happiness in the mouth . "" not to be outdone , puffs tissues tried later to introduce its product , only to learn that "" puff "" in german is a colloquial term for a whorehouse . the english weren ' t too fond of the name either , as it ' s a highly derogatory term for a non - heterosexual . the chevy nova never sold well in spanish speaking countries . "" no va "" means "" it doesn ' t go "" in spanish . ford introduced the pinto in brazil . after watching sales go nowhere , the company learned that "" pinto "" is brazilian slang for "" tiny male genitals . "" ford pried the nameplates off all of the cars and substituted them with "" corcel "" which means horse . when gerber first started selling baby food in africa , they used the same packaging as here in the usa - with the cute baby on the label . later they found out that in africa companies routinely put pictures on the label of what ' s inside since most people can ' t read . in the french part of canada , hunt - wesson introduced its "" big john "" products as "" gros jos .

"re : 5 . 1462 comparative method geoff pullum has raised the question of the null hypothesis with respect to proto - world and long-distance relatedness . i would suggest that the lack of progress in the dispute may be due in part to the conflict between two ways of setting the null hypothesis . a priori , in terms of evoutionary considerations , long range relationships going back to a single ancestor are to be expected : this point has been made by numerous linguists in discussion , if not so often in print . however , methodological considerations force us to set the null hypothesis the other way , since we clearly cannot disprove long-distance relatedness . the problem is analogous to medical disputes : there are plenty of researchers who would like to show once and for all that homeopathy , acupuncture etc . are of no benefit in the treatment of the illnesses for which such effects are claimed . but all that can be said is that we have no scientifically respectable evidence that homeopathy works ( please note that this is a purely methodological point - i do n't want to see linguist cluttered with replies disputing the homeopathic facts ! ) the greenbergian dispute is even less likely to be resolved by disproving long-distance relatedness hypotheses than the homeopathic one , since in the latter case one can at least do controlled trials : while there have been proposals on controlling for chance similarities , there will always be too many variables involved for the greenbergian null hypothesis to be refuted . steve matthews",Safe Email

Adios to options excess?
If the nation's politicians expect Silicon Valley to fall in line on the issue of expensing stock options, they're living in a fantasy world.
		Flipping through my Rolodex this past week, I couldn't find one solitary technology type willing to support even the mildest proposal to change how corporations account for stock options. The more common response was a verbal ""middle finger"" shouted in the general direction of Washington.
				No surprises, there. The options argument is not just about putting food on the table--make that a lot of food, in some cases--but about the way the computer industry views itself. Tech companies believe they belong in a different category, say, from the likes of Coca Cola, Washington Post Co. and Bank One Corp.--all which recently decided to begin expensing stock options.
				Tech titans also served notice they will remember to support friends--and shun foes--in Washington next November. An empty threat? Perhaps, but consider this: in the last national election, the computer industry contributed more than $40 million (52 percent to Democrats, 46 percent to Republicans.) That was good for a seventh place ranking, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.		
Charlie Cooper, Executive Editor/Commentary
		Â 
Why the options party is overTransamerica Investment Management portfolio manager Kenneth Broad says
it's easy to see why the tech industry is fighting so hard to keep options from
being expensed: no one likes to lose a free lunch.

Sorry about that.Yep, that did the trick.Thanks for the help!Regards, Paul Fries paul@cwie.net-----Original Message----- From: spamassassin-talk-admin@example.sourceforge.net [mailto:spamassassin-talk-admin@lists.sourceforge.net] On Behalf Of Vince Puzzella Sent: Thursday, September 12, 2002 11:23 AM To: Paul Fries; spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net Subject: RE: [SAtalk] 2.41/2.50 spamd/spamc problemdefang_mime 0-----Original Message----- From: Paul Fries [mailto:paul@cwie.net] Sent: Thursday, September 12, 2002 2:12 PM To: spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net Subject: [SAtalk] 2.41/2.50 spamd/spamc problem I noticed that after upgrading to 2.41 (or 2.50) from 2.31, the -F option was removed from spamd. This is fine because all of the HTML format mail seems to arrive properly. However, messages that get tagged as Spam arrive as just html source.Is there any way around this? I would like all HTML/RTF messages to retain their formatting even if they are flagged as spam. I would accomplish this on 2.31 by using the ""-F 0"" flag when starting spamd.Thanks!Regards, Paul Fries paul@cwie.net CWIE LLC ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-talk mailing list Spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-talk mailing list Spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-talk mailing list Spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk",Safe Email

"On Tue, Jul 30, 2002 at 03:47:40PM +0100 or so it is rumoured hereabouts, 
Niall O Broin thought:

   Record (MBR); this seems to be the most common configuration. You want
   to  install  LILO  on  what's  presently the second hard disk but will
   become the first hard disk.   Edit the file /new-disk/etc/lilo.conf as follows:        disk=/dev/hdb bios=0x80       # Tell LILO to treat the second

' gold ingots were originally * chopped * into small ( eventually , circular ) pieces and used as coins . in contemporary russian , the past passive participle of this verb is * rublennyj * ( e . g . , * rublennoe mjaso * ' chopped meat ' ) . gary h . toops wichita state university 5 . response : "" real "" in portuguese / spanish is cognate with "" royal "" and "" regal . "" my hunch is because it was currency backed by the crown , but it 's a hunch . it would be interesting to be able to do something like prove that the spanish / portuguese used the term ' real , ' which was picked up by the moors and carried with islamic invaders into se asia . also difficult . the russian "" rubl ' "" is a bit more than a hunch - - it derives from the word for "" cut "" : rubit ' ' to cut ' , and other words . check out fasmer 's ( vasmer 's ) etymological dictionary , available in german or russian . i was told by a slavic professor that this is cognate to "" rupee , "" but the guy was going around the bend and could easily be wrong on that point . t . beasley ucla 6 . response : the rial words are all originally "" after f [ rench ] ( and sp [ anish ] ) models "" and are indeed cognate with royal . in england a gold coin of this name was issued in 1465 , and there were french , spanish and scottish coins of the same name over the 15 and 16c . the name seems to have travelled with the maritime empires . dollar also has a complicated history . starting as the english version of thaler ( a coin of the german states ) it then was used for the large spanish coin ( worth 8 reales ) of spain . because of the importance of the spanish maritime influence and of its currency , the term became very widespread and was used ( even in parts of the british empire , such as the straits settlements - - we still use dollars here in singapore ) in many places , including in the us . you cannot assume that the use of dollar is a sign of american influence . rupee is different , coming from a sanskrit word for silver , it is of indian origin . anthea fraser national university of singapore 7 . response : according to vasmer 's etymological dictionary of russian , rubl ' ( gen . sg . rublj ' a ( stress on ending ) ) shares a root with the verb rubit ' ' hack ' and meant ' hacked off piece of a grivna ( larger unit of currency ) ' . gladney 8 . response : russian rubl ' is not related to rial / real . it comes from a root meaning ' cut ' . the origin of the term is from silver bars from which sections were clipped off ( otrubit ' in russian ) and used as currency . i remember visiting a church in moscow dedicated to the ' cut-off head of john the baptist ' ( otrublennoj golove ioanna predtechy ) . btw kopejka ( 1 \ 100 of a rubl ' ) means 's mall spear / lance ' and comes from the depiction of st . george killing the dragon which was the symbol printed on it . the russian word for money - 'd en ' gi ' - is of turkic origin and is one of several in the russian language coming from a turkic root meaning 's tamp ' . incidentally , i ' m pleased to see that the slovenian currency is the toler - one more from dollar . geraint jennings 9 . response : panamanians use the term real for a 5 centavo piece . it was interesting to me because the currency is in balboas & centavos , but , as with american money , this coin had its own name . as far as i know , it was the only coin that had its own name ( i lived there for 11 years ) . it was also a type of test in the marketplace to determine who was "" local "" & who was n't . when the price quoted to me was "" 2 reales "" & i pulled out the exact change , they knew i was n't a tourist ! the word real means royal in spanish , but i do n't know why the 5 centavo piece would be called such . caroline l . steele university of hawaii 10 . response : according to klein ' s comprehensive etymological dictionary of the english language , * rial * , * riyal * are from spanish * real * ( < latin regalem ) to which portuguese * real * is obviously related . i have no info on * riel * . the russian * ruble * and indian * rupee * are not related to the above nor to each other . they both come from indigenous words . marc picard 11 . response : according to the macmillan dictionary of measurement , the first real ( ` royal ' ) was a small silver coin issued by the spanish royal mint . rupya ( > rupee ) is an ancient indian word for ` ( metal made into ) coinage ' , and ruble may be related . dinar comes from latin denarius , a coin worth ten asses ( a word related to ace ) . anton sherwood 12 . response : . . . "" real "" was also the name of a old gold or silver coin in the kingdoms of castile , portugal and aragon ( later in spanish america ) . the first dated ' real ' was coined in castile in the middle of the 14th century . they were called ' real ' because they were coined by the crown , in opposition to local coins coined by bishops , counts and noblemen . according to my sources of information ( enciclopedia larousse - spanish version ) , there were ' reals ' in france too . in the 14th century , the iberian peninsula was divided in several territories : three christian kingdoms : castile , aragon and portugal , and a lot of small moorish kingdoms ( called ' taifas ' ) . it is not unlikely , thus , that the name for the ' real ' had been taken in arabic as ' riyal ' . one curiosity : in contemporary spanish , the sentence ' no tengo un real ' ( literally : i have not a real ) means ' i have not a dime ' ( the same in catalan : no tinc un ral ' ) . j . carlos ruiz universitat jaume i castells 13 . response : in the case of brazil 's real , the currency is named after an old currency which was always referred to in the plural as ' reis ' and ' mirreis ' ( thousands ) .

"feminine he feminine he ouch ! no doubt about it , pronouns and gender are touchy topics . robert millar ( in metaphorically slapping me around a little in the ad hominem mode ) makes some good points but mistakes my focus a bit , misspeaks my findings somewhat , and misstates the fuller design of my position a lot . his linguistic list vol-6 - 835 ( 22 jun 1995 ) responds to my vol-6 - 806 ( 12 jun 1995 ) . i don ' t mean to say that , as robert millar attributes , "" 's he ' entered english as a whole suddenly at the advent of printing "" - - puhleeeze . i do mean to say that the h - stem feminine suddenly , after printing begins , disappears forever from the written record . my broader conclusion is that the h - stem feminine was alive for centuries beyond the oed 's orthodox-view account of its purported demise . i don ' t discount the sh - forms during the periods when and in the regions where they are amply attested . far be it . i do , however , maintain that the "" significant "" cause , in the overview , for the disappearance of the h - stem feminine was , not that it began to resemble phonetically the masculine , but rather the standardizing force of printing ( the motive for this is a separate question ) . and , too , there is the telling evidence that spoken pronoun use is often quite different from written . and i am suggesting that some of the oe h - stems survived in speech beyond printing 's seeming signal of their demise . the late survival of the h - stem feminine has the implication for socio / political linguistics that 18th century grammarians , regarded during these past decades as androcentric ( for having written down the "" he rule "" ) must be admitted to not have been so - - "" he "" is the principal thrust of the androcentric argument , right ? i am tempted to apologize for my insensitivity to other people 's faculty for correctness . in this case , it resulted in robert millar suffering mood swings - - feelings he shared with us - - his sorrow , his anger , regarding my position . my intention was not to academically abuse or linguistically victimize anybody . but despite his mood swings , we may all nonetheless benefit from his hot flashes of insight appropriate to his rejoinder to my native morphology of singular "" they "" hypothesis . but i will not continue the "" they "" discussion here , however , so 's not to detract from the late survival of the h - stem feminine presently under discussion , and indeed much more the hot topic . robert millar says that he suspects that i only have a slight understanding of dialect diversity , and that my discussing material from _ piers plowman _ and _ ayenbite of inwyt _ is a way to "" circumvent . . . lalme , mcintosh and samuels . "" first i would suggest that he provide fuller citations , this for the benefit of those on the list who concentrate in other areas of linguistics than this subject ; and second i would like to make available to him and anybody else some of my charts resulting from my indexing and sorting all the citations for all the forms for all the third person pronouns in the oed . m . l . samuals , "" dialects and grammar , "" in _ a companion to piers plowman _ ( ed . , john a . alfred , 1988 ) , specifically identifies by dialect nine of the seventeen manuscripts of the a - version of _ piers plowman _ . these are the ones that had already been identified in kane - donaldson , 1960 ( _ piers plowman , the a - version _ , george kane ) , after generations of effort . the book is a momentous compendium that in my thinking was conceived with the intention of making work such as mine possible . i use the seventeen manuscripts of the a - version of _ piers _ as the mainstay of my argument . samuals is unable to identify the dialects in nearly half the manuscripts of piers . i specifically focus on _ piers _ because it is a manageable corpus that anyone can go and check for themselves . _ piers _ is a great source for studying diverse forms because the forms are all variations on the same text . where can one find such a wealth of data for comparative analysis ? and piers can also be considered the first highly "" popular "" work in medieval english , and for this reason , the scribes , in copying the work for their intended audiences , would tend to avoid esoteric , literary , and archaic forms . the "" cult of auctoritas "" is the conservative emulation of older forms by the copying scribe . robert millar alludes to this to explain the h - stem feminines found in manuscripts of _ piers _ . i have met with this criticism before . i will make available to anyone who wants them particular lines as found in all seventeen manuscripts , and rather than the conservation of forms , the contrary of the auctoritas principle seems to be found in _ piers _ , whereby the scribes , in copying from the original , tended to modify it to regional conventions . i am not saying that auctoritas was not in many instances of medieval scribal practice the rule . i ' m saying that looking at lines of _ piers _ , through the seventeen manuscripts , sees in them a tremendous diversity . and even so , the use of the h - stems in all the manuscripts - - assuming for the sake of argument they were not in colloquial use - - indicates that they were well known , nonetheless , does n't it ? robert millar reads between my lines that i consider the anglo - normans as "" wicked . "" not so . chronocentrism in the reading of history is as inimical to reason and human understanding as is ethnocentrism in the reading of culture . he holds to the orthodox view and says that "" the rising london standard spread much more rapidly than it ever would have done in an age of purely manuscript culture . "" but would n't the london "" standard "" better be called the status dialect . it is mistaken to assume that writing , before and after printing , reflected how people generally used language day-to - day . most people talk like _ i love lucy _ and _ the honeymooners _ , not like _ the new york times _ . today , for example , the indefinite / proverbial "" he "" is primarily a written status form ; the singular "" they "" a spoken form . i think it is very safe to assume that then , just as now , there is a common english and a status english within a particular regional dialect . it is on the basis of this assumption , coupled with evidence for the widespread knowledge of the h - stem feminine in the generations before printing , that i am postulating the late survival of the h - stem feminine . anybody who would like to have my charts showing the "" persistence "" of all the feminine and masculine h - stem forms from the 11th century on , comparative exhibits of lines through the seventeen manuscripts of _ piers _ , pronoun paradigms from the same manuscripts , and perhaps a few other items - - they are available for a dollar copy charge and two stamps for usa . jeffrey weber , 2843 n . spaulding ave . , chicago , illinois , 60618 , usa . this current transmission is more an aside than the summary that will be forthcoming . i have received an excellent critique from wittysan ( sean ) , which he sent also to robert millar , and would be happy for the asking to share it and my response as this inquiry continues .",Safe Email

to zero; but if you set it to say 0.01, spamassassin would ignore tests
with scores -0.01<0<0.01 (trading accuracy for time).The overkill variant of this feature would have scores scored by (score

Submitted manuscript should normally be 4000-6000 words long; longer ones will be considered but may be subject to editorial revision.Submission of a paper implies that its content is original and that it has not been published previously, and that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere.

little embeded controller spoke to its DOS (not exactly the easiest

creating the other end of it. Near the end of the project we gave it
extensive long burnin tests, sadly overnight tests would always crash
out for some obscure reason.  Tracking it down showed that my

Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. 
Register for Gnomedex today!   
I've finally done it! Lockrgnome's Top 50 
Mac OS X Tips is in publication 
and available for purchase at GnomeTomes.com. Less than half the tips have 
appeared in the Apple Core newsletter already, so purchasing them means 
getting mostly brand new content. This represents the first thing I've 
written that people might actually pay to read, so if we sell one copy, 
I'll be ecstatic. And hopefully, any of you who check out the tips will 
find them useful. I know that figuring out how to do each of the 50 things 
on the list has improved my personal OS X experience.Although this newsletter started out with Chris, Randy, and I writing 
sections of the newsletter, time constraints have limited the 
contributions of the other two guys. This does not mean either of them is 
truly less involved, it just means I'm doing more writing. Both Chris and 
Randy regularly send me links to cool Mac stuff they find, much of which 
will ultimately end up in upcoming issues. Since the writing will be 
primarily mine, I've opted to eliminate the ""Review by"" links at the bottom 
of each article. Unless otherwise noted, you can safely assume I wrote it. 
If you need to send me an e-mail, the E-mail The Editors Link in the 
sidebar will reach me, as well as putting your message in front of Chris 
and Randy.I've been doing some exploring of AppleScript over the past several months 
and believe I'm finally confidant enough in writing scripts that I'm going 
to add a section on scripting to the newsletter. I'm curious to know what 
your level of experience with scripting is, because I can either start with 
some really basic stuff, or skip the basics and dive into meatier scripting 
topics. Either way, I'm open to some 
AppleScript suggestions.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Jake LudingtonÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â

Sherlock Plugins v2.2 [600k] Mac OS 9/OSX FREE
http://www.searchstandard.com/
While doing some research for my top 50 tips, I discovered that turning 
off some of Sherlock's extras, like multi-language indexing, in the 
preferences will speed things up considerably, particularly for local 
machine searches. This renewed my interest in finding ways to add-on 
search capabilities to the bundled sleuth, resulting in my discovery of 
SearchStandard.com. This bundled collection of search plug-ins makes it 
possible to look for almost anything using Sherlock. Their Web site 
won't wow you, but SearchStandard's free plugins most certainly make 
finding things online, including searches on your favorite Mac sites, 
that much easier.

Xnet v1.0.6 [216k] OSX $48
http://bitcom.ch/products-xnet-e.htmlDealing with servers that offer mission critical services, like 
intranet access, e-mail, or Web serving, means dealing with those 
services failing from time to time. Don't be left in the dark 
when one of your services go down, let Xnet keep you informed. 
The unregistered version of the product lets you verify http, 
ping, smtp, and ftp service availability, with many more service 
verifications included in the pro version. Xnet runs on your 
local machine, verifying remote service availability and sending 
you a message when those services go down. The interface allows 
for user-defined services, with alert features for both an e-mail 
account (mine alerts are going to my cell phone) and locally via 
a sound from your machine.
Â GnomeTERMINALFor OS X installs with multiple users, there may come a time when you 
need to change ownership of a particular file. This is particularly 
useful in situations where one user created a file, but an entirely 
different user is the only one who will ever make future decisions 
relating to that file, like whether to keep it or throw it in the 
Trash. chown is the Terminal command designed to handle this. From 
the command line type:sudo chown username filenameYou'll of course want to substitute the username of the new owner for 
username. The name of the file receiving a change of ownership will 
replace filename.

particular file type, rename files, and reassign permissions. One of 
the best features of Show Info is it's ability to store ""comments"" 
related to a file or application. This can be a great place to store 
information on recently made changes to a file, information from others 
who've looked at a file, or in the case of applications, serial numbers

"I have translated the article in full - see 
end of post (I think that I've done a far 
better job than the Google translation - at 
least it's readable now - any corrections
appreciated).Stuff in {}'s is my (and others) additions 
to the debate.My apologies if I've paraphrased anybody 
incorrectly, I will be glad to retract if 
anyone is miffed.The article makes four main points.
1) Absence of critical clauses. 
In this case, the idea is that the licence 
is invalid because it doesn't specify
under what country's law the GPL is governed.
2) Specification in English only.That for the end user (as opposed to businesses), 
the GPL doesn't apply because it's not written 
in French.
3) Arbitary licence change.The point here is that (under French law) the 
author can change the terms of the licence 
arbitarily. This is because any granting of 
rights by an author must be clearly delimited
in terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and 
times. In the absence of such limitations, the 
original author has the right to change his 
software back to closed on a whim.
{David Neary makes the point that the copyright 
holder automatically retains the right to change 
the licence.Scott replies it simply requires authorisation from 
all *copyright holders*That's not my understanding. French law allows a 
GPL type licence *_on condition_* that the 
specific conditions of the granting of such
rights are clear - if they are not, there is
nothing to stop the original author taking
back ""his work"". The lawyers see this
(correctly IMHO) as a weakness in the GPL).}4) Hidden defects.Roughly, this clause means that the author(s) 
is/are liable for any defects if the consumer 
is not an IT engineer, so if Linux blows up 
and data is lost, then the authors are liable.
{Ciaran Johnson says that M$oft and others have 
similar clauses - the point here is that they 
are *_all_* invalid - just that this one 
affects the GPL also.Niall O'Broinn makes the point that it is not
a sale, but rather a service/leasing arrangement
and that's why it doesn't come under this point.I would suggest that the whole thrust of this
article has been to see software ""sales"" (even
if no money changes hands) as governed very
much by consumer law (in France anyway).
Rick Moen makes the point that it is not
a sale but rather a granting of rights which
are not default. See the bit about even the granting of 
rights by an author having to be 
explicitly specified - under French law.
The fact that two IP lawyers in France think that
the GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that 
there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract.}5) Roughly.There may be other reasons under French 
law why the  GPL may be invalid.-----  Whole Article. -----------
Freedom(a) is worth more than these 
imperfect licences.
Specialised lawyers look at the GPL.Lawyer Cyril Rojinsky (duly appointed to 
the court) and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum, both 
specialised in the area of intellectual property 
examine the ""free"" licences and in particular the 
GPL. They have published their study
in the review ""Proprietes intellectuelles 
(Intellectual property)[1]"" and their
conclusion is grim.
Their approach is interesting. The problem for 
them is not to know whether freedom is valid under 
French law (for them the question is a moot point)
but rather they asked themselves about the form 
and the content of the text of free licences, and 
in particular the GPL. The problem is not free 
programmes, but rather the licence contracts of 
free programmes.Absence of critical clauses.The authors tell us that first of all, the 
reference to ""copyright"" is not legally 
sufficient in the framework of international 
contracts  (which is the case of licence 
contracts for programmes developed and spread 
via the Internet). The idea of copyright can 
basically include differences from one country 
to another. This is why, under international 
contracts, it is necessary to specify to which 
laws one is referring (French law, American &c.).The authors only found three public licences 
which were correctly formulated on this point: 
QPL, IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public
Licence).Specification in the English language.Next, the authors remind us that (at least in 
France), no clause in a contract may be contrary 
to French law [2]. However, it turns out that a 
licence such as the GPL is contrary to French law 
in several respects. Firstly, it is written in 
English and the FSF doesn't officially approve 
translations. The ""Toubon law"" obliges this sort 
of contract to be written in French, including for 
businesses since the notion of ""user"" applies not 
only to consumers, but also to businesses, 
professionals &c. 
Contacted by the editors of LinuxFrench, 
lawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that, as 
far as business is concerned, the ""Toubon 
law"" is probably doomed to change since 
it is in contradiction of European directives 
on the subject, but whatever about that, the 
problem is still valid for individuals, and 
while waiting for it (French law) to change, 
French companies have to deal with it, since 
it is the law of the land.
A programme under the GPL can suddenly 
change licence.
Another problem, much more serious, is 
that according to French law, the author of 
a free programme can, at any time, invoke 
the invalidity of the licence for this 
software by simply changing the licence.
In effect, the law of intellectual 
property stipulates that the granting of  
rights by the author is subordinate to 
the condition that each of these granted 
rights be the object of a distinct clause 
in the granting act (i.e. the licence) and 
that the granting of any such rights be 
delimited with respect to its scope and its 
grantees, and also with respect to its 
location (i.e. where such rights may be 
excersised)  and duration of any such grants. 
[3] This is not the case of the GPL nor of
other free licences. Briefly, this means 
that in France, or elsewhere if the author 
is French, that which is under the GPL could 
revert to proprietary from one day to the next. 
 
The problem of the guarantee ""hidden defects"".
An other very serious flaw is that of the 
guarantee. The GPL licences and others show 
that the software is delivered ""without 
guarantee"". You are going to immediately
reply that commercical programmes carry the 
same clause in their licence contracts,
and this is correct. However, whatever is 
written in a licence contract, one cannot
free oneself from the ""guarantee from 
hidden defects"", since it is imposed in the 
Civil Code. This concept is poorly understood 
by the layman, it protects the buyer
(whoever it may be, individual or business, 
since it specifies the Civil Code and not 
consumer protection law) against hidden 
defects, deliberate or made in good faith by 
the seller. 
For example, if one buys a pair of socks 
in a sale, and the shop has a notice 
specifying that ""Sale items are neither 
refunded nor exchanged"", and on arriving 
home you notice that one of the socks has 
a hole in it, several scenarios are possible.
You could have checked the socks before 
purchase: the flaw is deemed ""obvious"" and
you can sing for your money.
You couldn't check the socks (they were 
packaged for example), and in this case, 
despite the notice ""neither refund nor 
exchange"", you may invoke ""hidden defect"" 
and have them changed or obtain a refund, 
it's up to you. Personally, I have already invoked in shops 
the ""hidden defect"" clause and it always 
worked well (shopkeepers are always very 
cooperative if you quote a couple of words 
of the Civil Code). 
The concept of hidden defect is rather 
wide, it is necessary that you hadn't 
the possibility of discovering the defect 
before buying the product and then 
(according to the Civil Code) that you 
wouldn't have bought it at that price if 
you had known about the
defect.
The third case which is much rarer , is 
if you are able to show that the vendor had
knowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn't 
inform you. In this case, not only does he 
have to reimburse the product, but all 
expenses incurred by the sale (metro 
tickets to go to the shop, the fuse 
which blew when you plugged it in &c.)
This idea of ""hidden defect"" applies to
 all products, including programmes. This 
was made abundantly clear by the 
authorities (and the courts) surrounding 
Y2K. This is particularly inconvenient for 
free programmes, since a site which 
offers a Linux distro for download is 
supposed to provide a guarantee against 
hidden flaws.
LinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if 
in the case of a free programme, 
one could speak about a ""hidden"" defect 
since the source code was available, 
he replied ""Actually, concerning the 
guarantee, the question of obvious 
defect will arise. This analyis will 
be different depending on whether the 
person who downloads the distribution 
is an IT professional or not"". OpenSource has this advantage over 
the proprietary programme: it protects 
the distributor against a guarantee of
hidden defect insofar as the buy is an 
IT person. But, for distribution to the 
public at large, the problem remains 
the same.Roughly Speaking.
Lawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself, 
this study is far from being exhaustive 
and many other areas could be explored. During this interview, we asked ourselves, 
for example, about the fragility of the 
GPL clause which forbids linking source 
code under the GPL with proprietary code. In effect, the laws of intellectual 
property give the right to the user 
to modify a programme with the
intention of permitting interoperability 
with another programme. If for that,
I need to link with a proprietary library 
(communication protocol, device driver)
I may consider as ""null and void"" this 
clause of the GPL.
The conclusion of this study is a wake 
up call for the community. ""Freedom"" 
merits more than these shoddy licences, 
which should be modified before court 
cases over them proliferate and put at 
risk the undeniable originality of 
this effort.

"Man killed 'trying to surf' on Tube train

Wednesday December 4, 2002 11:07 AM
An investigation has been launched into the death of a passenger who tried
to ""surf"" on a Tube train.
The passenger, a man in his mid 20s, died in the incident at Chalk Farm
station on the Northern Line on Monday night.
Witnesses have reported seeing the man trying to hang on to the train as it
left the north London station.
There is also a suggestion that he may have been waving at friends in the
train.
The man died when he struck the wall at the beginning of the tunnel at the
end of the platform.
""We think he may have been trying to jump on to the side of the train. It's
not quite clear what happened,"" said a London Underground spokeswoman.
The incident was being investigated by both LU and British Transport Police,
who today described the death as ""non-suspicious."" To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:

it's a no brainer, use apt-get or just download and install.What's more, OSS is fully ""imitated"", older apps using OSS are as happy as a clam.
My personal taste tells me newer apps which use alsa sound better (alsaplayer, xmms
with alsa module) to my ear.The 2 things that trick people are the modules.conf file, they didn't have that
automatic matrix page when I started with alsa, you don't know how good you have it.And on my old installs (only the first time I installed it on a clean box), alsa
always was ""muted"" until you fire up a mixer and turn up the music. It's possible
Matthias even took care of that too. Anyway it is/was only a one time thing on 1st
install, that was a long time ago for me.Those ALSA dudes had been trying to get it into the 2.4 kernel but missed it, but
it's been in 2.5 for a while now, so alsa is the future of sound in the linux kernel.--
That's ""angle"" as in geometry._______________________________________________

""Though summers are hard in any city, Tokyo's narrow streets, hordes of people and clusters of massive skyscrapers, largely unrelieved by greenery, produce a special brand of discomfort. ""And it gets worse every year. (((Oh yeah. You bet it does.))) The number of nights when temperatures stay above 25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit) in Tokyo has doubled over the last 30 years, while average temperatures have shot up by 2.9 degrees C over the last century. Relief, however distant, could be on the way. (((""Great news, weather sufferers! We live in the high-tech capital of a G-7 state!""))) ""At the behest of the Construction Ministry, the panel has drawn up a plan that would use a network of buried pipes, and water pumped from the sea, to cool things down. 'In the very best conditions, certain areas could in theory become as much as 2.6 degrees Celsius cooler,' said Yujin Minobe, a ministry planner. ""The huge air-conditioning systems currently used to cool buildings get rid of the heat they take out of the structure by venting it into the outside air, raising temperatures still further and creating a 'heat island' phenomenon in large cities. (((Soon whole *cities* will do it and vent their heat straight into the rising seas! Look out, Antarctica.))) ""Under the plan, this heat would be transferred to water in large underground tanks, and the water then pumped through a six-km (3.7-mile) network of underground pipes to a cooling plant on the Tokyo waterfront. ""There the heat from this water would be transferred to cooler sea water before the then-cooled water was pumped back through the underground pipes. The sea water, now warmed, would be released into the waters of Tokyo Bay. ""COSTLY PLAN. (((That's unsurprising.))) Minobe said the plan would cover some 123 hectares (304 acres) in the centre of Tokyo, including the Marunouchi business district and the posh Ginza shopping area, and would initially cost around 41 billion yen ($344 million). ""'Savings on reduced energy usage would eventually help pay for this,' he said. (((A real nest of ironies here, folks.))) Officials quoted in the English-language Japan Times said energy savings would total more than 1 billion yen a year, meaning the system would pay for itself in a bit over 30 years. ""However, Minobe said many problems remained with the plan, which has only been under discussion since April last year. One of the most serious problems is whether warmer water being returned to Tokyo Bay would damage the fragile marine ecosystem, a point Minobe said still required more study. (((Give it 30 years and there won't be any ecosystem left to study.))) ""He said the average temperature cut is likely to be only around 0.4 degrees. 'I'm not even sure people would be able to feel that difference,' he said. Any such plan, however, would likely produce a gleam in the eyes of Japan's huge construction industry, known for its propensity for public works projects. Although several are decried as wasteful, public works projects have long been used by the government in attempts to stimulate the economy. (((Nice use of the word ""attempts.""))) ""Frankly, I think this plan is still really more of a dream than anything else,"" Minobe said.

( 2 ) computational models and ( 3 ) symbol grounding . the target audience of this colloquium will include engineers and scientists in neural networks and artificial intelligence , developmental psychologists , cognitive scientists , philosophers of mind , biologists and all of those interested in the application of artificial intelligence to real world problems . programme : monday , may 15th , 1995 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * introduction : 9 . 00 registration + sustenance 10 . 00 ` an introduction ' noel sharkey ( department of computer science , university of sheffield , england ) biology : 10 . 30 ` the neuronal mechanisms of language ' valentino braitenberg ( max plank institute for biological cybernetics , tuebingen , germany ) computational models : 11 . 00 ` natural language and exploration of an information space ' oliviero stock ( istituto per la ricerca scientifica e technologica , irst ) ( trento , italy ) 11 . 30 ` how visual salience influences natural language descriptions ' wolfgang maass ( cognitive science programme ) ( universitaet des saarlandes , saarbruecken , germany ) 12 . 00 discussion 12 . 30 lunch grounding symbols : 2 . 00 ` on grounding language with neural networks ' georg dorffner ( austrian institute for artificial intelligence , vienna , austria ) 2 . 30 ` some observations on symbol-grounding from a combined symbolic / connectionist viewpoint ' john barnden ( computing research laboratory , new mexico , usa ) & ( department of computer science , university of reading , england ) 3 . 00 sustenance break 3 . 30 ` grounding symbols in sensorimotor categories with neural networks ' stevan harnad ( department of psychology , university of southampton , england ) panel discussion and questions : 4 . 00 ` grounding representations ' chairs + invited speakers s / in s / in : 4 . 30 ` de brief / comments ' paul mc kevitt ( department of computer science , university of sheffield , england ) 5 . 00 o / iche mha / ith * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * publication : we intend to publish a book on this colloquium proceedings . addresses iee contact : sarah leong groups officer the institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) savoy place gb - wc2r obl , london england , uk , eu . e - mail : sleong @ iee . org . uk ( sarah leong ) e - mail : mbarrett @ iee . org . uk ( martin barrett ) e - mail : dpenrose @ iee . org . uk ( david penrose ) www : http : / / www . iee . org . uk ftp : ftp . iee . org . uk fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-497 - 3633 phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-240 - 1871 ( general ) phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-344 - 8423 ( direct ) location : the institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) savoy place gb - wc2r obl , london england , uk , eu . academic contact : paul mc kevitt department of computer science regent court 211 portobello street university of sheffield gb - s1 4dp , sheffield england , uk , eu . e - mail : p . mckevitt @ dcs . shef . ac . uk www : http : / / www . dcs . shef . ac . uk / www : http : / / www . shef . ac . uk / ftp : ftp . dcs . shef . ac . uk fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 114-278 - 0972 phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 114-282 - 5572 ( office ) 282-5596 ( lab . ) 282-5590 ( secretary ) registration : registration forms are available from sarah leong at the above address and should be sent to the following address : ( it is not possible to register by e - mail . ) colloquium bookings institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) po box 96 stevenage gb - sg1 2sd herts england , uk , eu . fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 143 874 2792 receipt enquiries : + 44 ( 0 ) 143 876 7243 registration enquiries : + 44 ( 0 ) 171 240 1871 x . 2206 pre-registration is advised although you can register on the day of the event . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ r e g i s t r a t i o n costs _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( all figures include vat ) iee members 44 . 00 non-iee members 74 . 00 iee members ( retired , unemployed , students ) free non-iee members ( retired , unemployed , students ) 22 . 00 lunch ticket 4 . 70 members : members of the ieeie , the british computer society and the society for the study of artificial intelligence and simulation of behaviour and eurel member associations will be admitted at members ' rates .",Safe Email

"re : option pricing challenge zimin , to generalize your initial comment , for any process ds = mu ( s , t ) * s * dt + sigma ( s , t ) * s * dz , the delta - hedging argument leads to the black - scholes pde . this is true for any arbitrary functions mu and sigma , and so includes gbm , mean reversion , and others . there is no problem with this , because in the risk - neutral world , which is what you enter if you can hedge , the drift of the "" actual "" process is irrelevant . i believe your concern is that you would like to see a different option price for mean reversion process . this can only happen if the asset is not hedgeable , and so the actual dynamics then need to be factored into the option pricing . if you assume that the underlying is a non - traded factor , then the pde will have to reflect the market price of risk , and the drift of the actual process is then reflected in the pde . vasant zimin lu 10 / 17 / 2000 05 : 20 pm to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , pinnamaneni krishnarao / hou / ect @ ect , alex huang / corp / enron @ enron , kevin kindall / corp / enron @ enron , tanya tamarchenko / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : option pricing challenge dear all , i have a fundamental question back in my mind since 95 . hope you can give me a convincing answer . zimin - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - in deriving bs differential equation , we assume the underlying follows gbm ds = mu * s * dt + sigma * s * dz where mu is the drift , sigma is the volatility , both can be a function of s . then we use delta hedging argument , we obtain the bs differential equation for the option price , regardless of mu . with the bs pde and boundary condition , we can derive bs formula . fine . no problem . question comes here . suppose the underlying is traded security and follows , say , mean - reverting process ds = beta ( alpha - s ) dt + sigma * s * dz apparantly , this sde leads to a different probability distribution . however , using the delta hedging argument , we still get the same bs differential equation , with the same boumdary condition , we get the same bs formula . not fair ! from another angle , i can derive the distribution from the bs pde for the underlying , which is the lognormal distribution . my thinking is : can i drive the distribution for any sde from the option pde ? the answer should be yes , but got to be from a different pde rather than bs pde . then what we do about the delta - hedging argument ? thanks .",Safe Email

"sum : dets and number about a month ago , i posted the following query : i ' m looking for languages whose nps have the following three properties : ( 1 ) bare , unmarked nouns occur in argument position , and may be interpreted as either singular or plural ( eg . malay , mandarin , japanese , as opposed to english ) ; ( 2 ) at least some determiners are unmarked for number ( eg . english "" the "" , "" some "" , "" john 's "" , as opposed to "" this "" , "" these "" ) ; and , most interestingly , ( 3 ) when a bare , unmarked noun occurs in construction with a determiner that is unmarked for number , the resulting np * is * marked for number . so far , i am familiar with two languages satisfying the above three conditions . ( both are singaporean dialects of languages whose standard varieties do n't satisfy these conditions . ) singaporean malay ( 1 ) like in standard malay , bare , unmarked nouns are unmarked for number , eg . "" kucing "" ( cat / cats ) ; ( 2 ) again like in standard malay , the determiners "" itu "" ( that / the ) and ini "" ( this ) are unmarked for number , eg . "" seekor kucing itu "" ( that / the one cat ) , "" dua ekor kucing itu "" ( those / the two cats ) ; ( 3 ) unlike in standard malay , bare , unmarked nouns in construction with "" itu "" and ini "" tend to be interpreted as singular , eg . "" kucing itu "" ( that / the cat / ? * cats ) . [ apparently , there is some variation here between speakers , and between different constructions for the same speakers . ] singlish ( aka colloquial singaporean english ) ( 1 ) unlike in standard english , bare , unmarked nouns are unmarked for number , eg . "" cat "" ( cat / cats ) ; ( 2 ) like in standard english , prenominal possessors such as "" john 's "" are unmarked for number , eg . "" john 's one cat "" ( john 's one cat ) , "" john 's two cat ( s ) "" ( john 's two cats ) ; ( 3 ) when bare , unmarked nouns are preceded by prenominal possessors , the resulting construction can only be interpreted as singular , eg . "" john 's cat "" ( john 's cat / * cats ) . some questions : ( a ) is anybody familiar with more such examples ? ( references ? ) ( b ) is this a southeast asian areal feature and / or a common cross-linguistic pattern ? ( c ) in both of the above cases , an unmarked noun plus an unmarked determiner results in a singular np . are there any cases where the result is a plural np ? ( d ) does anybody have any ideas how to analyze / explain this phenomenon ( within any theoretical framework , or none ) ? * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * this is one case where the summary is much shorter than the query itself . two other languages emerged with a pattern identical to that of singaporean malay : japanese ( thanks to pamela a downing and mayumi masuko ) , and korean ( thanks to jae jung song ) . ( in the meantime , further field work of my own revealed that in singlish , not just prenominal possessors but also the definite article "" the "" exhibits a similar singularity effect : although unmarked for number ( as evidenced by "" the one cat "" , "" the two cat ( s ) "" ) , "" the cat "" is interpreted as singular . ) further observations were provided by steven berbeco , richard dearmond , bob fradkin , mark a . mandel , edith a . moravcsik , and gwyn williams .",Safe Email

"re : 5 . 1205 linguistics and imperialism for what it is worth , i remembering hearing somewhere that the old persian empire used to employ a number of translators who were competent both in the imperial language and in the language of their region to carry messages throughout the empire . presumably , this was somewhat similar to the british empire where imperial functionaries used to receive additional payments when they had passed appropriate exams in local languages . an old family friend who was district commissioner for some part of uganda used to sit in court regularly overseeing cases in customary law which were always conducted in the vernacular . these were not languages that were necessarily well-known in the fco , although he had to make regular reports back to london . although he would not have described himself as a linguist , it would seem that his work depended on an amount of ( pre-theoretical ) linguistics . tony bex",Safe Email

"project qin wang lloyds tsb pacific limited hong kong branch fax : + 852 - 301 - 66259 thank you for giving me your time . please be patient and read my email to you . i am a staff of lloyds tsb group attached in private banking services . i am contacting you concerning a customer and , an investment placed under our banks management 3 years ago , i contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication and i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you . in 2000 , the subject matter ; ref : bb / tsb / bank / 73 came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking services department . he informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8 . 35 million united states dollars , which he wished to have us turn over on his behalf . i was the officer assigned to his case ; i made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de - facto chief operations officer of the private banking services department , especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank . we met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed . i encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings . the favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and alternative investments . based on my advice , we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation , the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 10 million united states dollars , this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments . in mid 2001 , he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in europe . he directed that i liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm in europe . i informed him that our bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process , the bank would have to make a 9 . 5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges . he complained about the charges but later came around when i explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us . cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9 / 11 . i contacted my affiliate in europe and had the funds available in main land europe . i undertook all the processes and made sure i followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security consultancy firm , the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash . this small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well - connected organizations . in line with instructions , the money was deposited . he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from norway later that week . this was the last communication we had , this transpired around 20 th june 2002 . in june last year , we got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particular portfolio . this was an astounding position as far as i was concerned , given the fact that i managed the private banking sector i was the only one who knew about the deposit , and i could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit . i made futile efforts to locate him i immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of our bank . four days later , information started to trickle in , that he was apparently dead . a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in cannes , south of france . we were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed . the bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate . if you are familiar with private banking affairs , those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity , but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes . in his bio - data form , he listed no next of kin . in the field of private banking , opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence , accounts are rarely held under a name depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous . this bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself , ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said , rarely do they nominate next of kin . private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care , in this case ; he died in testate . what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something . it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational . the world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios . you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what i propose . there is us $ 8 , 370 , 000 . 00 deposited , i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless i instruct them to do so . i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the finance firm , the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when i sent the funds to the firm , all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process . the finance firm has no single idea of what ' s the history or nature of the deposit . they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward . this is the situation . this bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man ' s family ; they have investigated for months and have found no family . the investigation has come to an end . my proposal , you share similar details to the late fellow i am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation . upon receipt of the deposit , i am prepared to share the money with you in half and no more . that is : i will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you . we share the proceeds 50 / 50 . i would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me , but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit . but on the other hand , you with a similar name as the original depositor would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to claim . i assure you that i could have the deposit released to you in a few days . i will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the customer . i will then officially communicate with the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you . with these two things : all is done . the alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as accountholder . this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the firm . we can fine - tune this based on our interactions . i am aware of the consequences of this proposal . i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail . i ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive . if my offer is of no appeal to you , delete this message and forget i ever contacted you . do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal . you may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector . i am not a criminal and what i do , i do not find against good conscience , this may be hard for you to understand , but the dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move . such opportunities only come ones ' way once in a lifetime . i cannot let this chance pass me by i hope you understand because for once i found myself in total control and face to face with my destiny . these chances won ' t pass me by . i ask that you do not destroy my chance , if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me . i am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities . there is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking . i have evaluated the risks and the only risk i have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank . i am the only one who knows of this situation , good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life . let ' s share the blessing . if you give me positive signals , i will initiate this process towards a conclusion . i wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels ; i will deny knowing you and about this project . i repeat , i do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do i want you contacting me through my official email account . contact me only through this email address ( q _ wang @ o 2 . pl ) i do not want any direct link between you and me . my official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our total quality management policy . please observe this instruction religiously . please , again , note i am a family man ; i happily married with two kids . i send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences might be , but i know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold . this is the one truth i have learned from my private banking clients . do not betray my confidence . if we can be of one accord , we should plan a meeting , soon . i await your response . sincerely , qin wang * este mensaje fue enviado desde http : / / www . enterate . com . ar / * conectate gratis a internet desde enterate ! usuario : enterate @ enterate . com . ar clave : enterate desde buenos aires : 4004 - 8007 desde otras ciudades , consulta en :",Phishing Email

If no /dev/dvd exists, it'll create it.
If /dev/dvd exists, it won't touch it.
If someone installs ogle (a DVD player), I'm assuming the hardware is
recent enough for software playback and that the drive is a DVD-ROM... all
of them support DMA! But since that change requires a reboot or a manual
change, I'm still hesitating to integrate it :-/My goal is to allow users to install a DVD player through synaptic and play
DVDs in no time. Outputting a message in the %post section of a package is
always a bad idea, putting the tip in the %description sounds good though.Matthias--

( i will also touch on them and their . ) the orthodox view of pronoun history ( for she , they , them , their ) involves the north-to - south "" wave theory , "" as stated as early as 1866 by richard morris . it is the theory that is set forth in the oed and has never been questioned . the feminine h - stem , according to this accepted view , was displaced in the language in a wave of cultural diffusion when the feminine pronunciation began to approximate that of the masculine pronoun in the 12th and 13th centuries . the other pronouns discussed here also involved the north-to - south waves of diffusion . my contention is that the significant cause for the historical replacement of these pronouns ( except for the h - stem subject plural ) was the standardizing force exerted by the printing press - - it happened rather quickly - - not waves of cultural diffusion over centuries . in my analysis of the seventeen manuscripts of the a - version of piers plowman , the h - stem feminine is found with great regularity . how can this be explained ? in many lines , the occurrences in the manuscripts of h - stem feminines outnumber the sh - forms found in the same lines . many manuscripts use both forms . the manuscripts are copies of copies of copies . on the bases of the manuscripts that have been dated , i place the "" average "" manuscript within a few generations of the advent of printing . my explanation , perhaps the anglo - norman rulers had a predilection for a distinction in the masculine / feminine singular . while the folk generally used the bi-gendric "" egalitatian "" h - stem form in the vernacular , the more politically correct sh - form was preferred at oxford / cambridge , in proper social etiquette , and in writing when referring to a "" lady . "" when caxton began his enterprise , the sh - form ( as well as the others spoken of here ) became enforced as the correct form through the great power of the press . and the h - stem feminine remained known in the spoken language , alongside the sh - form , well beyond printing . it had not dropped from speech and become archaic by 1300 . when the "" prescriptive "" grammarians prescribed indefinite-he , this h - stem still carried in its semantic domain a bi-gendric reference . although the seventeen manuscripts of piers is my main corpus of evidence , there are various kinds of other evidence to support my theory for the late survival of the h - stem feminine in the colloquial of the middle ages . one of the more interesting is the existence of the h - stem feminine in gullah ( when and if west african origins are discounted ) . other supporting evidence can be found in various places in the oed . it is scanty and scattered , but nonetheless there . h - stem and sh - form feminines existed for centuries , side by side , as formal and informal , although , for sure , in many cases the distinction was lost . "" hi was a fair wifman "" is found in the mid - 14th century agenbite of inwyt ( i am currently translating this work ) . in it , the pronunciation of the feminine pronoun is the same as the modern masculine ! ( the vowel had not yet diphthongized ) . the supposition that this h - stem is a "" literary form , "" as suggested by the oed ( presumably this means copied in manuscript from an earlier exemplar ) is untenable because the agenbite was translated directly from french . i have extracted the pronoun paradigms from all the manuscripts of the a - version of piers . in addition to the great evidence for the wide use of the h - stem feminine centuries beyond its supposed demise , the h - stem plural ( although extremely rare ) can also be found ( in line prologue 63 it is used to satisfy alliteration ! ) . and in every manuscript of piers the h - stem obliques ( modern them and their ) are to be found ( often alongside the th - forms ) . and then , in a generation after printing , the h - stems for she , they , them , and their seem to vanish ! ! , at least from the written evidence . the h - stem feminine held wide currency in the colloquial of the middle ages and therefore , supported by other evidence , was not unknown to the prescriptive grammarians a few centuries later . the accepted theory that the h - stem feminine dropped from the language before 1300 , prior to the time the poem "" alysoun "" was written , is in need of revision . piers shows it to have been very much alive in the 15th century . an explanation for the replacement of the h - stem plural nominative by they , a replacement occurring earlier than the other pronouns in question , has never been proposed . would n't there have been pressure for some alternative to the oe h - stem subject plural as a result of the disappearance of the preterit plural during this period ? because the english verb lost its marker in the preterit for number , the h - stem plural ( which shared the same form with the feminine singular nominative ) became in some contexts ambiguous for number . a new form was needed . although a norse form may have reinforced it among northern speakers , there was a native singular form available from the same set of oe demonstratives that gave us the . the and they appear to be duplets . if this is so , then the singular morphology of they is in fact historical and has been alive in the colloquial for a very long time ! ! the , in oe a singular , developed as a singular / plural ( the car / cars ) , extended to the accusative , but lost its absolute ( stand-alone ) use . they , retaining the pronunciation of oe the , was restricted to the nominative , and became the unambiguous written plural by 1400 - - but in the colloquial it retained also its singular morphology . later , in regard to them and their , caxton used the th - forms as the unambiguous plurals because the h - stems for these pronouns had throughout england a tremendous diversity of forms . for example , in one ( written ) dialect her would be a feminine / singular / possesive , in another it would be an all-genders / plural / possesive . caxton needed forms that would be universally understood , hence the written th - form obliques replaced the h - stems in an historic blink of the eye - - not in a wave of cultural diffusion that coincidentally wafted through london at the time caxton set up his print shop . a well supported case can be made for the late survival of the h - stem feminine , into the 15th century , and hence a case for its cultural currency at the time of the prescriptive grammarians . if this is so , the exclusion of one gender from "" cognitive space "" would not apply , and hence the motives of these grammarians would have to be reassessed . if in fact the sapir - whorf hypothesis does apply to pronouns , then i invite comment to help me understand two facts . 1 ) that for two-thirds of the history of english the subject pronoun used to refer to a group of men / boys was a form that was identical to the feminine singular ; and 2 ) the expression by a pronoun of "" possessing "" something by men / boys was also for two-thirds of the history of english expressed by a form that was morphologically marked for feminine but not masculine .",Safe Email

More like Apple's implementation - the Gconf2 files are bog-standard 
XML, should you feel tempted to edit it by hand :)There are some possibilities that using standardised configuration tools 
provide: the ability to centrally manage a large number of computers - 
something like Windows' group policy. Although that would require other 
applications to use GConf as well .Haven't installed Limbo beta2 myself - been sidetracked by work; the 
fact that the computer I'm installing it on is connected to a dodgy USB 
ADSL modem that requires heavy kernel patching means that I would have 
to do it over a weekend - but I don't think Red Hat currently does it 
for its config tools.Regards,Michel__________________________________________________

"special issue cl journal / finite state methods . . . please post or distribute call for papers computational linguistics special issue on finite state methods in natural language processing recent years has seen a substantial increase in the use of finite state techniques in many aspects of natural language processing as mature tools for building large scale finite-state systems from various research laboratories and universities become available . this trend was by no means foreseen as late as ten years ago given the well-known demonstration by noam chomsky in 1957 that finite-state methods are inherently incapable of representing the full richness of constructions in a natural language . nevertheless , it is evident now that there are many subsets of natural language that are adequately covered by finite-state means and that there are many other areas where finite-state approximations of more powerful formalisms are of great practical benefit . as a follow-up to the fsmnlp ' 98 , international workshop on finite state methods in natural language processing , it was proposed that a collection of papers in this area be published as a special issue of the computational linguistics journal . we would to encourage authors of the papers presented at this workshop , as well as all others who would like to contribute , to submit full versions of their papers for consideration for this special issue . guest editors : lauri karttunen ( xerox research centre europe , france ) kemal oflazer ( bilkent university , turkey ) guest editorial board eric brill ( johns hopkins university , md , usa ) eva ejerhed ( umea university , sweden ) ronald m . kaplan ( xerox palo alto research center , ca , usa ) martin kay ( xerox palo alto research center , ca , usa ) george kiraz ( bell laboratories , nj , usa ) andrs kornai ( bbn , ma , usa ) mehryar mohri ( at&t labs research , nj , usa ) mark - jan nederhof ( dfki , germany ) atro voutilainen ( university of helsinki , finland ) submission details please submit 6 copies of your hard-copy manuscript to lauri karttunen xerox research centre europe 6 chemin de maupertuis meylan , 38240 , france by monday , october 19 , 1998 . the format of the submission should follow the general submission requirements of the journal . manuscripts for computational linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper ( 8 . 5 by 11 inches , or a4 ) , double-spaced throughout , including footnotes and references . the paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words . manuscripts must be written in english .",Safe Email

' s stock and bond prices took another beating after the energy company ' s release late monday of its much - anticipated third - quarter financial filing with the securities and exchange commission , which revealed potentially major new cash - flow and earnings headaches . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , enron shares were at $ 6 . 991 , down $ 2 . 07 , or 23 % . enron once again topped the big board ' s most - active list with 89 . 9 million shares traded , more than twice the volume of the next most active stock . enron bond prices fell into the range of between 70 cents and 80 cents on the dollar , according to market observers . following the announcement earlier this month of dynegy inc . ' s plan to purchase enron for around $ 10 billion in stock , bond prices had firmed to above 80 cents on the dollar . yesterday , a dynegy spokesman wouldn ' t comment on the status of the pending acquisition , other than to say his company was reviewing enron ' s third - quarter financial report , filed with the sec , as part of continuing "" due diligence . "" under the proposed acquisition , dynegy would exchange 0 . 2685 of its shares for each enron share . based on dynegy ' s 4 p . m . price yesterday on the big board of $ 41 . 70 a share , off $ 1 . 90 , the deal values enron shares at about $ 11 . 20 - - well above the current market price . monday ' s third - quarter financial report from enron , which supplemented and revised enron ' s earnings announcement last month , reinforced fears that the energy - trading company is in a "" precarious financial position and will be for awhile , "" said andre meade , head of u . s . utility research at commerzbank securities . as reported in the wall street journal , enron ' s sec filing monday said that because of the company ' s deteriorated credit standing , it might have to repay a $ 690 million note by this coming monday . the filing also said enron might be forced to take a $ 700 million pretax charge to earnings in the current quarter , ending dec . 31 , due to a drop in value of some of its assets . houston - based enron has been in deepening financial distress for the past month , since announcing big asset and shareholder - equity reductions in the third quarter . much of the turmoil has been caused by the company ' s dealings with partnerships headed by former enron officers , including its former chief financial officer . those dealings are the subject of a formal sec investigation . enron ' s financial woes have also led to a "" reduced level of transaction activity "" with the company by trading partners , the sec filing said . how well , or poorly , enron ' s energy - trading volume holds up is "" the million - dollar question , "" said simmons & co . analyst jeff dietert . enron ' s trading operation has been the company ' s main profit engine and the major attraction for dynegy in the acquisition deal . yesterday , other major energy - trading companies said they were still doing business with enron but were closely monitoring the firm ' s condition . standard & poor ' s ratings group also reaffirmed enron ' s credit ratings even though it said monday ' s sec filings "" raise liquidity issues "" for the company . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron , vdeg may bid to export bulgarian electricity , paper says 2001 - 11 - 21 03 : 40 ( new york ) sofia , nov . 21 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the largest energy trader , seeks to export electricity from bulgaria to italy , dnevnik daily reported , citing unidentified sources from the state energy agency . enron , as well as two german companies , including vdeg , will be invited to bid at a tender for the national electricity company to select energy trading partners , the paper said . enron is being bought by rival dynegy inc . for about $ 20 billion . currently nec ead is the sole exporter of electricity from bulgaria , which provides energy to most of its neighbors , including serbia , macedonia , montenegro , greece , kosovo , albania , and turkey . last year the country exported electricity worth $ 117 million to turkey alone . opening the energy market to competition is part of the requirements for bulgaria to join the european union . the international monetary fund , which is expected to provide $ 150 million to bulgaria over the next year , also insisted on reorganization of the energy industry . raymond james analyst cartwright comments on enron disclosure 2001 - 11 - 21 07 : 45 ( new york ) new york , nov . 21 ( bloomberg ) - - jon kyle cartwright , a senior vice president and senior energy analyst at raymond james & associates inc . in st . petersburg , florida comments on the enron corp . ' s disclosure that it may have to repay a $ 690 million note next week following the downgrade of its credit ratings to the lowest investment - grade level . the houston - based energy trader made the disclosure in a filing with the securities and exchange commission known as a ` ` 10 q ' ' on monday . ` ` i have to believe that dynegy knew about this , maybe not when the deal was signed , but certainly before the 10 q was published . there was wiggle room in the deal for both write downs , which effectively includes both the note and the potential write down for whitewing . ' ' ` ` there still appears to be enough liquidity to handle the write offs and the $ 690 million limited partnership note . ' ' ` ` over the short - run , the rest of this week , it is going to be difficult for anyone to trade with enron , because they should be generally concerned that neither enron nor dynegy has made public comments on this 10 q . ' ' ` ` if it is only for a few days , we ' re ok . as long as dynegy doesn ' t pull out of this deal , we should be ok , and enron should maintain its investment grade rating , and all the enron corp . bonds should mature without incident . ' ' ` ` hopefully the company will comment shortly . if there has ever been a company that couldn ' t afford to disclose a time bomb in a 10 q , it is enron . this should have been disclosed prior to this . it added to the crisis of confidence .

' ' if enron is out there standing on its own , i don ' t think that ' s sustainable , ' ' said a senior executive of one of enron ' s largest energy - trading competitors . besides dynegy ' s continued commitment to the merger , analysts and industry executives said the most crucial issue for enron was restoring the confidence of investors and trading partners in its financial health . the restatement of earnings two weeks ago and other disclosures about complex dealings with partnerships , some of them run by enron ' s former chief financial officer , had prompted the major credit - rating agencies to rate enron ' s bond ' s at the lowest investment - grade level . ' ' if the rating agencies take them below investment grade , they can ' t do business anymore , ' ' the rival executive said yesterday . ' ' that ' s become almost conventional wisdom . ' ' another downgrade could force enron to pay or refinance up to $ 3 . 9 billion in debt , and it could prompt other energy traders to halt dealings with the company entirely . in fact , standard & poor ' s , one of the major credit - rating agencies , gave enron something of a vote of confidence yesterday . while it will continue to review the company for a potential downgrade , s . & p . said , it expects enron ' s near - term financial health ' ' to be sufficient to carry the company through the completion of its proposed merger with dynegy . ' ' s . & p . noted that enron was continuing to negotiate with major banks and other institutions for an infusion of $ 500 million or more in new equity and that enron executives still believed that the company would complete the sale of $ 800 million in assets by the end of the year , raising badly needed cash . major energy trading companies continued to limit their exposure to enron and carefully watch the company ' s financial condition . officials at the el paso corporation and reliant energy , two large energy traders in houston , said yesterday that they continued to do business with enron . but others have pulled back . mirant , a large electricity generator and trader in atlanta , is ' ' trading on a very limited basis , and we don ' t expect to broaden that until enron ' s credit situation improves , ' ' a spokesman said . executives at two other companies that rank among the nation ' s largest traders but who spoke on condition their companies not be identified , also said they had scaled back trading . one of those companies was selling natural gas and electricity to enron only in cases in which the sales helped balance its account with enron , an executive said . ' ' we ' re trying to do business that offsets our risk , ' ' the executive said . ms . denne , the enron spokeswoman , said the company ' s ' ' transaction volume remains within the normal range , ' ' adding that there was ' ' no recognizable change ' ' yesterday in the number of companies willing to trade with enron . ' ' no one significant has dropped off , ' ' she said . analysts said enron ' s disclosures late on monday indicated that the company was using up cash more rapidly than had previously been thought . most of the $ 5 . 5 billion that the company has taken in through equity infusions and borrowings the last month has already been depleted .

' ' now that the sale of dabhol is a certainty , the aggressive enron may be forced to adopt a pragmatic approach during the negotiations , ' ' said k . ravi , a utility analyst with the consulting firm of frost & sullivan . dabhol power ' s 2 , 184 megawatts of generating capacity was the showpiece of an economic liberalization drive in the early 1990 ' s . but enron has had repeated conflicts with politicians and environmentalists over the project . earlier this year , the maharashtra state utility , which has a contract to buy all of dabhol ' s output , complained that the prices were too high and stopped paying its bills , running up $ 64 million in arrears before the power was cut off and the plant shut down . enron raised the stakes in the dispute by serving notice that it would terminate the contract and pull out of the project . but a group of indian state - owned banks and financial institutions , with $ 1 . 4 billion committed to the project , countered with challenges to asset sales by dabhol and with other legal obstacles . earlier this month , a court ordered dabhol not to send the utility a final termination notice until dec . 3 . initially enron adopted a tough posture over the sale of dabhol . kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive and a close friend of president bush , was quoted as saying that india would have to face economic sanctions if the government did not create a favorable climate for the sale of enron ' s stake . but enron now will find little lobbying traction in either washington or new delhi , and the coalition - building diplomacy of the war in afghanistan makes it unlikely that the bush administration would agree to press india on enron ' s behalf . in september , the asking price for enron ' s stake in dabhol power was said to be over $ 1 billion . but the two serious indian bidders - - tata power and bses , both privately owned utilities backed by major industrial concerns here - - are reportedly willing to pay only about half that . if the lenders and prospective buyers adopt a take - it - or - leave - it line , enron may have little choice but to accept their offer and swallow a huge loss on a controversial project that once gleamed with promise .

"" in light of that , "" said mr . gerber , "" we would expect to see a bit of an increase in sales on november . "" he adds that sales typically drop again in december as people opt to wait another month so they can defer capital gains for another year . in terms of overall purchases , "" insiders are obviously finding fewer bargains after this nice market surge , "" says jonathan moreland , director of research at newsletter insiderinsights . com . still , he says there are a few sectors where insiders have been indicating they see value in their own shares . among those , he says , are independent power producers , such as aes corp . and nrg energy inc . , which he expects will benefit from the need for new energy plants . he also points to lending institutions household international inc . and metris cos . , which because of their sensitivity to interest - rate moves have suffered on fears of a recession , says mr . moreland . but they are likely to "" benefit from the lower interest rates and an economy which will likely strengthen in the next year .

"" enron ' s hellish tuesday on the market came after the company made new disclosures in a u . s . securities and exchange document , filed after the market closed on monday . most pressing was news that enron has until nov . 26 to put up $ 690 million in collateral against a debt to a partnership . otherwise , the partnership could begin liquidating assets , including a brazilian gas company which enron plans to sell to raise $ 250 million . in the sec filing , known as a form 10 - q , enron said it was suffering a decrease in trading volumes , particularly in longer - term deals . trading volume down since the trading business - enron ' s crown jewel and the segment most coveted by dynegy - is low - margin , volume drives its profitability . it is too early to tell what effect the lower volumes would have on future profitability , enron said , but analyst andre meade of commerzbank securities said dynegy will watch the volume drop carefully . "" if it has a long - term effect , it will definitely impact the value dynegy will put on this business , "" he said . dynegy gave a limited response when asked if it was concerned about lower volumes , and whether it was aware of the $ 690 million debt before it made its deal to acquire enron . "" we are in due diligence and enron ' s 10 - q is a part of the that process , "" dynegy spokesman john sousa said . meade said the filing yet again showed enron ' s penchant for making disclosures bit - by - bit . of note was its latest downward revision of its third - quarter earnings , he said . "" the restatements are coming out piecemeal as they find them , and my guess is they don ' t know the full extent . we think further revisions are likely , "" meade said . one analyst who follows enron said the sec filing painted a darker picture of the company ' s cash position , given that it had $ 2 . 3 billion on hand as of nov . 16 . "" it shows that the cash drain on the company looks to be very significant , "" said the analyst , who asked not to be identified . standard & poor ' s said enron currently has about $ 1 . 5 billion in cash , but that follows an infusion in recent weeks of $ 1 . 5 billion from the dynegy merger , $ 550 million in loans secured by pipeline assets , and $ 3 billion from its revolving credit lines . another $ 450 pipeline - backed loan is expected in a day or two , and enron said it expects $ 500 million of private equity investment plus $ 800 million from asset sales . enron owes $ 9 . 15 billion by the end of next year , and its total liability for debt and other obligations is $ 16 . 86 billion , according to the sec filing . its merger with dynegy is expected to close by the third quarter of 2002 , raising the possibility that an enron without investment - grade credit might not have the liquidity to survive that long . enron acknowledged as much in the sec filing , stating starkly that it would be unlikely to "" to continue as a going concern , "" if a credit rating cut triggers the early payoff of $ 3 . 9 billion in debts to partnerships to which it belongs . enron said that if its rating were cut , it would work out other payment arrangements . s & p said a similar effort being undertaken in the case of the $ 690 million debt will likely be successful "" given the alignment of the interests between enron and the banks .

heim : well , enron filed their 10 q last night , as i think everyone knows , and it did include a modest restatement , but i don ` t really think that ` s the big news . more of concern is the debt obligation that you talked about , although even that is - - $ 690 million is manageable . but i think the 10 k filing has addressed many of the previous concerns about some of these limited related party partnership that enron has and the obligations , the backstopping enron has provided with those partnerships . hays : michael , could you just tell us a little bit more about that ? because it , it - - i get - - it ` s so complicated , i really have - - you know , have a hard time following it after a while . and what i can ` t understand is , presumably , the reason they were opposing this deal , dynagy and enron , is that dynagy knew what was going on , figured they were a lot of deals like this , so one - - i ` m kind of surprised that they would be talking about maybe triggering the material adverse charge at this point , which could get them out of the deal . i mean , they say they ` re not going to do it , but bankers say they ` re talking about it . so what ` s going on here ? heim : well , it ` s not unusual for deals to have a material adverse condition clause , and there was a lot that ` s unknown in enron . it ` s a very difficult company to follow , and dynagy certainly has done a lot of due diligence . but it was in a crash period , and i ` m sure there ` s a lot of questions dynagy has with enron as well . the - - dynagy was very careful on how they worded the deal and left themselves some outs . and i don ` t know if they ` re going to try and take advantage of those outs . but certainly i ` m sure they share a lot of the concerns that enron investors have . francis : is there another shoe to drop next week when these obligations come due on the 26 th ? heim : well . . . francis : and should we be braced for another big day in - - for enron stock , or has it found a basement ? heim : well , that ` s a very tough question to answer . certainly anybody who ` s been negative on the stock has done so not because they knew there were some problems coming , but because they didn ` t know that there weren ` t problems coming . and i certainly can ` t say that there isn ` t other problems that could be disclosed . yes , in situations like this , you have to rely a little bit on the company . and unfortunately the company ` s reputation ` s already been stained . francis : michael , you got a sell on the stock . is there a point at which this issue becomes attractive , or are there just too many potential bodies buried here ? heim : well , i ` m a firm believer there ` s always a point at which stock becomes attractive . but at this point , it ` s really become a betting game on whether the deal gets done . and there are certainly people , a lot of people speculating on that , both sides , and as an analyst , i don ` t know if you necessarily have a more insight to that type of question than somebody else . it ` s not a bet that we want to take at these prices . hays : ok , well , michael hime , you certainly , certainly got a lot of reasons , i guess , not to take the bet , certainly not before you have to . michael heim , a . g . edwards energy analyst , thank you so much for joining us . hime : thank you . francis : thanks . we appreciate it . copyright ?

' ' welcome to the program . floyd norris , financial editor , ` ` the new york times ' ' : thank you . romans : this has been a fascinating story and stock to watch develop . first off , what is the latest that drove this stock down more than 20 percent again today ? norris : well , yesterday , after the close , they filed a report with the securities and exchange commission , and as people studied it overnight , they were quite surprised . and it got worse this morning . they disclosed that they have $ 690 million in debt . so they may have to pay next week if they can ` t either come up with collateral , which will not be easy , or persuade the lenders to renegotiate . and what was shocking about that wasn ` t that the debt existed , that was known , it was that they had to pay it so quickly . it turns out , according to what people are telling analysts , that dynegy ( company : dynegy inc . ; ticker : dyn ; url : ) , which agreed to buy them only a week or two ago , didn ` t know about this . they had not told them , apparently , enron didn ` t realize they had this problem . romans : ok , wait . there seems to be a lot of things that wall street didn ` t know was going on . and every sort of revelation is a big blow to the stock . who is watching what ` s happening here and how can there be so many surprises . that ` s confusing to a lot of folks who are following this . norris : well , it ` s - the fact wall street is surprised isn ` t necessarily surprising , but the fact that enron seems to have been surprised is surprising . they ` ve had a lot of turnover . it reinforces the suspicion that jeff skilling , the chief executive officer who quit in mid - year , and perhaps the treasury and chief financial officer , both of whom were ousted within the last month as this crisis grew , may have been the only people who really understood what was going on there ; and that makes you wonder what else might yet come out . romans : well , what about auditors and what about the board governing this firm . and what about ken lay , i mean he is sort of the statesman of the industry , isn ` t he ? and he ` s running this company again ? norris : well , he ` s back running the company . the suspicion is , and lay denies it , he says he knows what ` s going on , my suspicion is that he didn ` t know the details . he trusted . he understood the company was overvalued , probably . this is a man who was taking out hundreds of millions of dollars by selling stock , exercising stock options and selling stock . but i suspect he didn ` t understand all of the details and now they are coming back to haunt him . the other thing that is bothering people today is these numbers show the company is burning through cash at an amazing rate . and enron has not really given us a good understanding of why they are burning through the cash that fast . but it raises questions about whether the company can continue operating until its supposed to be taken over by dynegy by next september . and , of course , the way the stock is trading , it ` s obvious that a lot of people on wall street doubt that deal will go through or at least doubt that it will go through on the announced terms . tracy eichler , ubs painewebber : floyd , my question regarding shareholder lawsuits . it seems like there ` s some validity there . any new news on the sec investigation and the magnitude to those lawsuits ? norris : there ` s no news on the sec investigation . there are , of course , huge shareholder lawsuits . they ` re filed against enron , they ` re filed against the current and former officers of the company . and they ` re filed against arthur andersen , which audited this company . the accounting regulators are already starting to check in again on arthur andersen , which used to be the class of the accounting business and has had a string of recent embarrassments . romans : all right , floyd norris for ` ` the new york times , ' ' thank you so much for joining us . norris : thank you .",Safe Email

"1,000 people will have seen the piece of spam that could've been avoided. But the other 99,000 will never see that spam. Evenly distributed, it means that an average user will only see 1% of spam. That's not realistic, because not everyone will get the same spam, but the basic threshold can be adjusted. At the very least, 30 people need to ""vote"" on a given piece of mail to make a realistic decision. Since there's no ""no"" vote mechanism (except revocation--and that's after the fact), only a ""yes"" vote mechanism exists and so if you received 30 ""yes"" votes then you could safely say that you got a reasonable sample.The system could pretend to have never seen the piece of mail until after it determined that it was probably spam. So instead of a rating going up incrementally, it would take a big leap at the beginning (from undefined to a relatively high number) and then go from there. So after the first group of people (our samplers, we'll say) have seen the spam, no one else would ever see it.As far as unsubscribing, I'm always leery of clicking on the link (and don't do so unless I specifically remember signing up for something), but the sample population will decide for themselves whether they feel that it's spam.So ultimately, I guess I'm saying that the most effective route would be to use a constantly changing sample pool and just accept that there is some fraction of users that will have to see the spam. In a system that depends on people deciding whether or not something is spam, is there any other way?Isaac-----Original Message----- From: Patrick Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2002 2:13 PM To: Oates, Isaac Cc: razor-users@example.sourceforge.net Subject: Re: [Razor-users] many vs oneOn Wed, 14 Aug 2002, Oates, Isaac wrote:> I'm new to razor but have studied trust systems before.

A simplistic view would be that 999 subscribers received a piece of spam that could have otherwise been avoided. But the reality is likely that many, many more individuals would have received the piece of spam when you factor in report times.> By having the server pretend to never have seen it, you can avoid > people who just re-report spam because it was already marked as spam, > something that is completely useless.Wrong. razor-check will tell you if a specific piece of mail matches something already in the database. If you have the system pretend to have never seen a piece of mail, how do you propose people use the system for filtering?> What about revocations?

If you've ever taped a ""Seinfeld"" episode or traded music online, Uncle Sam may want you--to stop.
Draft legislation that is winding its way through Congress would sharply limit Americans' rights relating to copying music, taping TV shows and transferring files through the Internet. The first part of their proposal, which would limit backup copies, has drawn objections from academics and nonprofit groups that have reviewed it.Under current copyright law, Americans who record a TV program or radio segment generally may ""sell or otherwise dispose of"" that analog recording or digital file as they wish.The proposed bill would end that exemption, handing copyright owners substantial new control over the distribution of their works by curtailing a consumer's right to copy material under a doctrine known as ""fair use.""Another salvo in the copyright battle was delivered when a federal judge said that record labels and film studios could expand an ongoing copyright lawsuit to include Sharman Networks, which distributes the popular Kazaa software.The Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Association of America last October sued three prominent file-swapping companies in Los Angeles federal court. The suit named Morpheus parent StreamCast Networks, Grokster and Kazaa BV, the Netherlands-based company that originally created the Kazaa software.However, in February, Kazaa BV sold the Kazaa file-swapping software to Sharman, a company later revealed to be based in Vanuatu, a small island in the South Pacific. The recording and movie industry trade groups asked permission to add that company to the lawsuit in June. A judge ruled this week that Sharman could be added to the lawsuit.
Shoring up U.S. security Computer security is becoming increasingly critical to President Bush's proposal for a homeland defense department. When Bush formally proposed the department last month, he never mentioned the Internet or so-called cybersecurity. But as Capitol Hill scrutinizes the proposal, politicians are fretting about tech-savvy terrorists--and insisting any new agency must shield the United States from electronic attacks as well. House Republicans have asked committees for any suggested changes to the White House-backed bill by the end of the week.Included in the proposal are radical changes for the U.S. government's Internet defenses. The plan would stitch together nearly all computer protection functions, from the Commerce Department's Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office to the Computer Security Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to the Federal Computer Incident Response Center.Additionally, the proposed department is likely to get its own privacy czar. A draft of the legislation seen by CNET News.com states that the Secretary of Homeland Security must appoint a privacy officer to ensure that new technologies ""sustain and do not erode"" privacy protections and to verify that the agency's massive databases operate within federal guidelines.
Who's running your computer? Perhaps a more immediate security concern to individuals is what is going on now with their computers.Apple Computer OS X users could let hackers piggyback malicious code on downloads from the company's SoftwareUpdate service.  According to the BugTraq mailing list, a hacker named Russell Harding has posted full instructions for how to fool Apple's SoftwareUpdate feature to allow a hacker to install a backdoor on any Mac running OS X.The exploit takes advantage of SoftwareUpdate, Apple's software updating mechanism in OS X, which checks weekly for new updates from the company. According to Harding, who claims to have discovered the exploit, the feature downloads updates over the Web with no authentication and installs them on a system. So far, there are no patches available for this problem.Users of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Outlook and Outlook Express applications may be vulnerable to a recently discovered software flaw that could leave their system open to malicious code carried on Web pages or in e-mails. A security researcher and partner at risk-assessment company PivX Solutions warned that HTML objects embedded in Web pages and e-mail could carry code that allows an attacker to check out victims' cookie files, read their documents and execute programs on their computer.Still another problem is plaguing Outlook: A popular plug-in that lets users encrypt and digitally sign messages has inadvertently weakened security and left the mail program open to attack. Security company eEye Digital Security issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associates' Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerability in the add-on could let attackers execute malicious software on a victim's computer.
Wi-Fi everywhere, but not everyoneOne of the first cameras that can shuttle photos and videos using the Wi-Fi wireless networking technology has made its debut. IQinVision plans to sell the camera to companies such as security firms that need to put video cameras in places where wires can't go, or as a way to quickly install a temporary security system.This product is among the first devices to combine digital videography and wireless LANs (local area networks) that use the Wi-Fi, or 802.11b, standard. Expect more digital camera makers to follow suit. The number of digital cameras has been on the rise, and it's only a matter of time before a camera maker wants to add a popular new technology like Wi-Fi.Wi-Fi is also invading handheld devices. Wireless equipment maker Intersil is working with SyChip to incorporate 802.11b wireless networking technology into a Secure Digital (SD) card for handheld devices. The card, which should be available to manufacturers for testing in the fourth quarter, lets handheld owners add and remove wireless networking capabilities to handhelds that contain an SD slot from Palm, Hewlett-Packard and other companies.Wireless SD cards would make it far easier for handheld manufacturers and owners to get these devices linked. Only a few handhelds include wireless capabilities, and they are some of the most expensive on the market. With the card, wireless access becomes an option for many.Not everyone is pleased with the explosion in popularity of wireless networking. Broadband providers are cracking down on some customers, threatening to cut service to those who set up the inexpensive wireless systems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access.After being introduced just a couple of years ago, so-called Wi-Fi ""hot spots"" that tap into cable or digital subscriber lines (DSL) are now in at least 15 million homes and offices. The problem is that one paying subscriber can set up a local network that allows several other people to access the Net, for fun or for profit.

I'm sure if you call their customer service number
they can unsubscribe you.   I took me 4 tries,

' s credit and debt ratings have fallen to junk status , crippling what once was the largest u . s . energy trader , observers are pointing fingers , and wondering what took the top three u . s . credit rating agencies so long to act . "" the rating agencies are at fault here for waiting so long and thinking they could hold the deal together , "" said tom burnett , a director of merger insight , a research and analysis firm . "" that ' s not their job . there ' s not one new piece of information available today that wasn ' t available last week . "" the agencies - standard & poor ' s , moody ' s investors service and fitch - denied being influenced to keep enron ' s once investment - grade ratings , or they declined to discuss the issue . observers , though , said investment banks arranging enron ' s now - dissolved merger with once - smaller rival dynegy inc . - citigroup inc . and j . p . morgan chase & co . - had been fighting to preserve those ratings . they now stand to lose millions of dollars of advisory fees with the merger ' s collapse . "" s & p and moody ' s have stated that they ' re not going to be the cause of problems for a company , and in my opinion waited until dynegy decided not to proceed with the merger , "" said sean egan , managing director at egan - jones ratings co . in philadelphia . egan - jones on wednesday cut its own debt rating for enron to "" c , "" one notch above default . anger grows prices on enron ' s distressed bonds had been in a tailspin for several sessions , and after wednesday ' s cuts they fell by more than half . traders bid them on wednesday near 25 cents on the dollar , with often triple - digit yields . "" i do get the feeling there is a lot of anger and feeling that something should have occurred before "" wednesday , said mary ann hurley , vice president of fixed - income trading at d . a . davidson in seattle . "" there was talk in the markets that the absence of official statements from dynegy and enron ( on ) tuesday should have been taken by the rating agencies as a clue that the merger was about to fall apart .

"" in any rating activity , we ' re discussing developments with the companies , so we ' ve been in touch with the companies as we normally would do , "" he said .

"" all this wouldn ' t have occured if the market wasn ' t deregulated . "" enron was one of the earliest and most aggressive advocates of power deregulation , which breaks down traditional utility monopolies by letting customers choose their electricity provider , banking on competition to drive down prices . its aggressive strategies gave enron 20 percent of the north american electricity and natural gas market , and enron was ranked no . 7 on fortune magazine ' s list of the biggest u . s . companies . the downfall but in recent weeks , enron ' s credit and debt spiralled out of control as a series of partnerships designed to hide debt off of its balance sheet caused its investors to lose faith . the partnerships , which included top enron executives , are the subject of a u . s . securities and exchange investigation . in a fluid , competitive marketplace , punishment comes quickly . enron ' s share price closed at 61 cents on wednesday , down $ 3 . 53 , or 85 percent , from a peak of over $ 90 in august 2000 , after the top three u . s . rating agenices downgraded enron to junk status . "" there are winners and losers in deregulated markets and people who champion them are not necessarily those who will be around in the end , "" keenan said . as more business and mounting profits fell into enron ' s hands , the company took on a air of invicibility . despised by some market players , many of its trading partners nevertheless were willing to go out on a limb because of enron ' s good reputation , smart traders , and high - flying share price . enron ' s core business of trading electricity and natural gas relies highly on creditworthiness , and much of its trading was backed by a corporate guarantee , a kind of standby iou . once that credit guarantee began to be be doubted , credit managers pulled the fire alarm and reduced their exposure . "" up to about two months ago , an enron corporate guarantee was seen by many as money in the bank . then the whole house of cards came down , "" keenan said . people began looking at enron more closely , especially since october when a series of negative disclosures about the company ' s finances forced the company to lower its reported earnings by $ 600 million over the last four years as a result of questionable off - balance sheet transactions . enron ' s trading business - its crown jewel - has also suffered from lower volumes as wary trading partners shifted business away from the cash - poor and credit - threatened enron . what now ? if enron ' s fallout has a significant affect on the regulated companies it did business with , regulators and policymakers could slow down the pace of power deregulation . but if the damage is confined to the wholesale trading market , there will not be as much impact , analysts said . so far , 23 states and the district of columbia have moved to deregulate their retail power markets , although nearly one third of them have delayed the onset of competition partly due to california ' s failed free market experiment . analysts also said if enron is no longer a major player in the large customer market , where it has been very effective , deregulation is not likely to proceed as quickly . "" it ' s a perception issue . enron ' s struggle may have adverse consequences on retail choice even though it has very little to do with it , "" said sharon reishus , an associate director of north american power at cambridge energy research associates ( cera ) , an independent research firm based in cambridge , massachusetts .

( ene ) and dynegy inc . ( dyn ) is going to hurt , no doubt . but before discussions of "" systemic risk "" and other doomsday scenarios gain too much of a foothold , it ' s worth pointing out that the enron mess is no long term capital management . the death of the enron - dynegy deal is probably tantamount to the demise of enron , too . and that eventuality , should it come to pass , is going to have repercussions beyond one or two energy - trading companies . so it ' s fair enough that this news pulled down stocks of all kinds wednesday . yet the deal ' s demise and troubled enron ' s likely subsequent fate isn ' t a call on the broader value of stocks , whose fortunes remain tied to other fundamentals ( more on this later ) . the bottom line : a major corporation with about $ 62 billion of assets seems destined to fail . in some ways enron could indeed end up being like the implosion of hedge fund long term capital management , since so much of enron ' s assets are involved in trading . and it ' s for sure that the still relatively new industry of trading energy commodities like gas and oil - the so - called merchant energy business - is in shock and will have to regroup . stepping back a bit from the energy business , some big - name banks and other firms may end up with some bad debts if enron ends up in bankruptcy , as most industry observers now expect . individual investors , including mutual - fund holders unlucky enough to own some power - company shares , will also take a hit , as will some pension funds . all told , holders of enron stock have lost more than $ 60 billion this year , with the stock down more than 99 % . but the enron - dynegy deal ' s undoing , while painful and headline - grabbing , is not about to endanger financial markets across the globe , and there is where the analogy to a failed hedge fund thankfully breaks down . even at the epicenter of the enron debacle , there ' s no systemic risk : other merchant energy traders are already saying they ' ll be able to adjust , and s & p said in a conference call wednesday afternoon that it didn ' t expect to downgrade firms similar to enron . in fact , the biggest risks to stocks remain the same as they were yesterday or last week or last month . they ' re fundamentals unrelated to what ' s going on at enron , whose problems started with questionable off - balance sheet transactions . key among those risks , ironically , is stocks ' recent good fortune , which has driven share prices back up to levels that are unsustainable if history is any guide . this is big concern for technology shares but a host of other sectors , too . here ' s proof from elsewhere in wednesday ' s news : gap shares may be trapped near their 52 - week low , but according to prudential securities , which lowered its rating on gap to sell , they ' re still trading at 93 times projected 2001 earnings . another fundamental worry for stocks is the consumer economy , whose health is being hampered by the rising unemployment rate . u . s . payrolls , beefed up like never before during the 10 - year economic expansion , will be pared plenty more . fired people - or those who fear that fate - spend less and certainly pull back on equity investments . a third fundamental that will continue to weigh on stocks is the uncertainty about when exactly corporate earnings will return to meaningful growth . while companies of many stripes have begun to talk about bottoming out , when exactly they ' ll start to see real revenue gains again isn ' t clear . but you can bet that fundamental no . 2 ( the consumer economy ) is a factor here , and until revenues and thus earnings start advancing again , fundamental no . 3 ( share price valuations ) are also at risk . as for the enron debacle , bankruptcy might be the only way out . dynegy will probably have to cough up some money for breaking up the deal and cover some credit exposure to enron ( though it also stands to gain a natural gas pipeline owned by enron ) . chevrontexaco corp . ( cvx ) , which owns just over a quarter of dynegy and which also injected cash into enron , might have to kiss that money goodbye . houston might also suffer , as it ' s the home of both enron and dynegy . but the enron story is , despite all the headlines , a relatively contained one , and the challenges and risks for the rest of the stock market haven ' t changed . - by gene colter , dow jones newswires 201 . 939 . 2068 e : mail : gene . colter @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . in the money : enron trades heavily off the nyse by carol s . remond 11 / 28 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) a dow jones newswires column new york - ( dow jones ) - numbers often speak volumes . or in the case of enron corp .

' s risk management skills will be raised . kenny norton the ratings agency downgrades are doubly damaging for enron because rating agencies played a critical role in efforts to shore up the houston company . some observers , noting the steep discount on enron bond prices , had criticized the agencies ' reluctance to downgrade enron debt . but s & p and moody ' s said they wanted to see if the dynegy offer would revive enron . of course , as enron ' s core operations continued to sputter even after the deal was agreed to , the rating agencies ' position looked increasingly untenable . inevitably , if the deal doesn ' t go through and enron implodes , some people will blame s & p for enron ' s demise . s & p analyst todd shipman replies : "" we have always promised people that we wouldn ' t overreact , and i don ' t think we have overreacted . "" he adds that the turning point came when the rating agency stopped believing dynegy and others could revise the deal terms and find cash in time to stop the deterioration in enron ' s business . also , he doubted whether those working to salvage the merger would come up with the sort of provisions needed to keep enron viable . dynegy abandons enron deal shares of energy trader plunge , bankruptcy looms cbsmarketwatch . com lisa sanders 11 / 28 / 01 enron shares ( ene ) closed at 61 cents , down $ 3 . 50 , having lost as much as 85 percent of their value on the day and having collapsed from a 52 - week high of almost $ 85 just 11 months ago . the company lost around $ 2 . 6 billion worth of market capitalization from tuesday to wednesday . close to 342 million enron shares had changed hands wednesday by the close , and the stock broke the all - time volume record of 309 million shares set by intel on sept . 22 , 2000 . dynegy ( dyn ) shares lost $ 4 . 92 , or 12 percent , to $ 35 . 97 . saying in a conference call that it had to "" protect "" its shareholders , dynegy announced it had terminated its agreement with enron , citing "" enron ' s breaches of representations , warranties , covenants and agreements in the merger agreement , including the material adverse change provision .

"" to do this , we will work to retain the employees necessary to the continuing operations of our trading and other core energy businesses , "" said enron chairman and ceo ken lay . enron told employees their questions would be answered in due course and they would receive their paychecks on friday . analysts said the next step for enron would likely be a bankruptcy filing . "" chapter 11 is not the worst of all worlds by any means , "" said john olson , a houston - based energy analyst .

"" i ' m not aware of any changes in any status of the merger , "" dynegy spokesman john sousa said before the s & p announcement . the merger agreement contained a material adverse - affect clause that , if triggered , allowed dynegy to walk away from the deal . the decline in enron ' s stock price and information contained in the company ' s 10 - q filing of nov . 19 could had activated the clause , but olson said the s & p downgrade clearly fit the description of a material adverse affect . also wednesday , ubs warburg and rbc capital cut their ratings on enron , to "" hold "" from "" strong buy "" and from "" strong buy "" to "" buy - speculative , "" respectively . lisa sanders is a dallas - based reporter for cbs . marketwatch . com . citi , morgan sink on enron exposure cbsmarketwatch . com 11 / 28 / 01 greg morcroft new york ( cbs . mw ) - - j . p . morgan and citigroup shares fell wednesday as investors fretted about the banks ' exposure to troubled energy trader enron . enron shares collapsed after dynegy abandoned plans to buy the largest u . s . energy trader and standard & poor ' s cut its rating on the company to junk bond status . j . p . morgan chase ( jpm ) fell $ 2 . 30 , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 37 . 50 . fellow bank stock citigroup was the second biggest dow loser , dropping $ 2 . 75 , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 47 . 80 . both firms have served as lenders and advisers to the embattled enron , which today saw its debt rating cut to junk status and its would - be acquirer dynegy walk away from the deal . early afternoon calls to citigroup were not returned , and a j . p . morgan spokesman declined to comment on reports of the bank ' s exposure to the situation . the wall street journal reported that both banks were attempting to finance dynegy ' s proposed purchase of enron , and had each committed roughly $ 700 million to $ 800 million in the form of various loans , about half of which were unsecured . the report noted the banks had also committed an additional $ 250 million in equity investments . enron deal falls apart enron ( ene ) shares ended the day at 61 cents , having lost as much 85 percent of their value . dynegy ( dyn ) shares closed down 12 percent at $ 35 . 97 . in a report wednesday , rating agency s & p cut enron ' s rating to b - minus , or junk status , from bbb - minus , which is the lowest investment - grade rating . the rating agency said that the move reflects "" concerns about the viability of the merger agreement with dynegy and liquidity implications of the possible failure of that transaction . the ratings are placed on creditwatch with developing implications . "" shares could be worthless analyst michael heim at a . g . edwards said the downgrade of enron ' s debt by standard & poor ' s "" kills any chance of a deal "" with dynegy . he believes dynegy will have no problems using the debt downgrade to walk away from the deal without paying a break - up fee . "" without a deal , enron has no value , in our opinion , and will most likely be declared bankrupt shortly , "" heim explained in a note to clients . "" unlike other bankruptcies in which a stock continues to trade at a low price , there are no hard assets to salvage . "" he added the s & p downgrade will force enron to accelerate a debt payment of $ 3 . 9 billion , making it virtually impossible for enron trades to interact with most counterparties . u . s . bancorp piper jaffray estimated that enron represents about $ 500 million exposure to citigroup and $ 300 million to j . p . morgan chase . "" n our judgment , these credit facilities are well - collateralized , "" the firm said in a note , anticipating that non - performing assets would increase by $ 440 million at citi in the fourth quarter and $ 300 million at j . p . morgan , reflecting an enron bankruptcy . greg morcroft is new york news editor of cbs . marketwatch . com . at enron , best lay plans go awry commentary : from cabinet prospect to bankruptcy cbsmarketwatch . com 11 / 28 / 01 by david callaway san francisco ( cbs . mw ) - - for ken lay , the collapse of enron corp . goes beyond one of the largest and swiftest corporate meltdowns in u . s . history . it represents the destruction of a lifetime of work that until only three months ago had the texas business leader and political rainmaker perched at the top of the corporate world , the most powerful energy mogul in history and an advisor to the president of the united states . it was less than a year ago that the 59 - year - old lay was being touted as incoming president bush ' s top choice to be treasury secretary , or at the very least , energy secretary . he ranked no . 36 on a list of the 50 best ceos last year published by worth magazine , after having put together a 240 percent return on shareholder value in enron ( ene ) stock over the last three years . enron ' s market value rose from $ 2 billion in 1985 , when lay created the company through a merger of two texas natural gas firms , to more than $ 80 billion earlier this year . but all of that power and prestige came crashing down over the last few months , culminating wednesday in a complete collapse of enron ' s shares in reaction to news that rival dynegy ( dyn ) would not step in to rescue the failing company . when the dust settled , enron ' s shares stood at 61 cents each , its total market value at $ 454 million . see full story . lay and enron now face an almost certain chapter 11 filing , which would be the biggest in u . s . history , and a slew of lawsuits as well as a federal investigation into how they built a tangled web of derivative trades and energy businesses into the empire that it was . a power broker unplugged now lay , a behind - the - scenes string puller in the corridors of power for more than a decade , will find out just how loyal his friends are , starting with bush . lay is a close friend of the bush family and has been one of the largest contributors to the president ' s political campaigns for president and texas governor . enron has pumped more than half a million bucks into bush ' s coffers over the years , including $ 100 , 000 for last year ' s presidential campaign , which was matched by lay and his wife . lay hired former cabinet members james baker and robert mosbacher after they left their positions with the cabinet of bush ' s father , george bush , in the early 1990 s . and with his political largesse came the benefits . lay had vice president cheney ' s ear earlier this year when cheney was presiding over the establishment of bush ' s energy policy , a process cloaked in secrecy that even today cheney refuses to shed light on . in may , he found himself in hot water after the new york times reported that lay called curtis hebert , then chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission , and offered his support if hebert would change his views on electricity deregulation and embrace bush ' s push for retail energy competition . hebert said he refused , and had the impression his job was in jeopardy . lay later denied that he had threatened hebert ' s job security . whatever the case , hebert was later replaced as chairman of the agency by patrick wood , chairman of the texas public utility commission . lay was more successful in his adopted hometown of houston , where he was able to convince gov . bush to deregulate the state ' s electrical markets in 1999 and where , earlier this year , the houston astros began playing in their new stadium , enron field . that lay is a remarkable executive and power broker is without question . he took a rinky - dink natural gas company and in just over 16 years turned into the mightiest energy empire in american history , virtually inventing a new energy market , which enron itself controlled . bill gates would have been proud of the monopoly . but the speed with which the empire collapsed and the shambles that is left suggest that , at best , enron was not much more than an elaborate hedge fund that bet too much on itself . and now ken lay , rainmaker , has fallen back to earth . david callaway is executive editor of cbs . marketwatch . com",Safe Email

strategies that are PROVEN WINNERS.                  If you've read any other books on eBay, you know that all of them are designed
for the computer idiot and the auction novice. They tell you how to register,
how to list an item, how to avoid fraud, etc. This is not the information
you need to make millions on eBay. You need to learn effective SELLING STRATEGIES
not read a photocopy of eBay help files! My manual assumes that you already
know your way around eBay; you don't need any specialized computer knowledge,
but you should be familiar with buying and selling on eBay auctions. I'm
not going to waste your time teaching you how to register - I'm going to
pass on the SECRET SELLING TECHNIQUES that I use each and every day to bring
in hundreds of thousands of dollars selling my products on internet auctions.
The manual comes as a complete course with the following lessons:Make a Fortune on eBayÂ™Â

designed for re-use.  I'd like to see a module that can take a single
message or a collection of messages and tokenize each one.I'd like to see the tokenize by customizable, too.  Tim had to exclude
some headers from his test data, because there were particular biases

> Bigger Bar Code Inches Up on Retailers
> August 12, 2002
> By KATE MURPHY I can't imagine why they're inching forward through 
13- and then 14- digit extensions; seems they should
just leap ahead to something with real headroom, say
40-digit numbers (128 bits or more). How hard can it be to widen the glyph area and 
narrow the bars? The sensors have got to be tens
or even hundreds of times more accurate/robust 
than when barcodes first took off.One segment of the article along these lines:> But moving to 13 digits may not be enough. The Universal
> Code Council and EAN International, which formed an
> alliance in 1996, strongly advise manufacturers and
> retailers to go a step further and prepare their systems to
> accommodate a 14-digit code. That is the length of a newly
> patented bar code that takes up less space. Its reduced
> size means that it can be affixed to small items like loose
> produce, and the extra digits let a retailer keep track of
> additional data like batch and lot numbers. A newly *patented* bar code, that merely fits 14 digits
into less space? I sure hope there's more to this
""invention"" than ""more lines, and narrower"". They might as well go 2-D to fit in lots of extra bits,
which could also ease the transition to the capacity 
radio-transponder tags may offer.A bunch of info on different barcode standards, including
2-D variants, with examples is at:http://www.makebarcode.com/specs/speclist.htmlSomething very much like a 2-D barcode is Xerox ""Dataglyphs"":http://www.parc.com/solutions/dataglyphs/- Gordon

"midmonth report : early warning - cera alert note : the following was sent out by cera and has a short term forecast of prices and alternate fuel pricing . note the price differential forecasts by basin . cera alert : sent wed , november 15 , 2000 title : midmonth report : early warning author : n . american gas team e - mail category : alert product line : north american gas , url : http : / / www . cera . com / cfm / track / eprofile . cfm ? u = 5526 likewise , a 5 percent warmer - than - normal scenario could decrease demand by 1 . 7 bcf per day relative to normal weather . fuel switching with natural gas markets this tight , there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market . residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run , which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market . this winter we expect * all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so * a loss of 700 million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter * industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500 mmcf per day off of gas * gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices , as much as resid will act as a floor for gas for december cera expects an overall demand increase of 4 . 5 bcf per day relative to last december and a 14 . 4 bcf per day increase in demand relative to november , with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching . supply - the rebound the pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense , but us supply is beginning to rebound . the recent steep decline in us lower - 48 capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000 , given the soaring gas - related rig count . * the success in reversing the decline in the gulf of mexico is related to the combination of - the ramp - up of the hickory and tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf , adding to the recent startup of the muni field ; these fields could add over 0 . 5 bcf per day later in 2001 - the response of the shallow water to the strong late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity * other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater gulf of mexico , with 0 . 5 bcf per day in 2000 and 2001 , and onshore , led by the bossier sand play in freestone county , texas , the barnett shale play in wise county , texas , and the powder river basin coal seam play . * further increases in drilling are likely to slow . new deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs . producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews . regional markets - wild winter in the west extremely cold weather in the west has brought rockies prices close to parity with henry hub prices and triggered early season spikes at sumas in the north and topock in the south . pipeline maintenance on el paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to topock differentials of over $ 2 . 00 per mmbtu . tight pricing relationships to the henry hub in the san juan and rocky mountains should hold through february , with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline . winter has arrived in earnest across north america , but the start - up of firm transportation service on alliance is delayed once again , this time until december 1 . nonetheless , flows on the pipeline are under way ; cera estimates that flows during october averaged 450 mmcf per day . during november that total should climb to 750 mmcf per day , despite the later published start date . with or without alliance flows , a weather - driven rebound in midwestern demand relative to november and december last year should keep prices in chicago at a significant premium to henry hub prices . in the northeast , differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter , despite greater flows into the region from atlantic canada this year ( see table 3 ) . cera ' s outlook by region follows : * rockies . very cold weather within the region has brought rocky mountain prices near parity with henry hub prices . a break in the cold or a cold snap in the east will likely widen the differentials , but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu below the henry hub price . cera expects a december average differential of $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu ; however , this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather . a warm week in the rockies could still push differentials toward $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu . * san juan . san juan prices will continue to hold close to rockies prices through the winter , with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions . heating loads in the rockies will determine the san juan to henry hub differential , with extended cold weather in the rockies pulling both prices close to the henry hub price . cera expects the december differential in the san juan basin to average $ 0 . 20 per mmbtu . * permian and mid - continent . unlike prices within the rest of the west , differentials between the henry hub and the mid - continent and permian basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter , as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west , depending on regional weather . cera expects a permian to henry hub differential of $ 0 . 11 per mmbtu and a mid - continent differential of $ 0 . 08 per mmbtu for december . * chicago . alliance flows into the chicago market are now running close to 750 mmcf per day . however , the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed chicago differentials up to near $ 0 . 15 per mmbtu relative to the henry hub , despite delays in the completion of the vector pipeline . cera expects the strong pricing at chicago to continue , and december differentials should average $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu . * northeast markets . assuming normal weather , we expect to see december basis for new york relative to henry hub at $ 1 . 03 per mmbtu . new england will likely see prices $ 0 . 05 - $ 0 . 15 higher , depending on the pipeline . much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs . for example , with a 9 percent retention rate from the gulf coast into new england , last december would have seen retention costs of approximately $ 0 . 22 ; at $ 5 . 70 , that same retention equates to $ 0 . 50 . despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the northeast from the atlantic canadian fields , there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets , and an additional 166 , 000 mmbtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity . because of this tightness , should this month ' s weather be colder than normal , we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in january 2000 . these spikes could even exceed the highs seen in january , depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized . canadian markets - winter begins the colder - than - normal weather has increased demand in western canada but is only now being felt in the east . storage peaked in the west in early october at approximately 225 bcf below last year ' s level and 6 bcf below the five - year average . even with modest withdrawals since that time , storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs . easter canadian storage has continued to grow , pushing levels to over 245 bcf , 11 bcf above last year and well above the five - year average . with the eastward movement of the colder weather , withdrawals are likely to begin . this higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on transcanada . the good news resulting from the cold is a more normal "" freeze - up , "" which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season . gas well completions are expected to reach 8 , 500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next year . further delays for alliance ? the "" commercial "" in - service date for alliance has been delayed until december 1 , the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line , delays in the completion of the aux sable liquids extraction plant , the delay of vector , and a lack of supply . the pipeline has been flowing gas , however , with volumes building up since september . it is estimated that flows for november will average 750 mmcf per day . transcanada has taken the full brunt of the alliance flows so far , with northern border and pgt remaining strong . december should see alliance flows build to between 900 and 1 , 000 mmcf per day , with modest reductions in flows on northern border and pgt . storage withdrawals will likely keep transcanada reductions close to 350 mmcf per day , year - over - year , until vector begins service to eastern canada . high prices : strong pull west the high demand in the pacific northwest has also provided strength for aeco . the aeco - henry differential has dropped to the high $ 0 . 30 s and low $ 0 . 40 s as a result of this increased pull . for december , the differential is expected to average $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu , for a resulting aeco average of c $ 6 . 97 per gigajoule ( us $ 5 . 10 per mmbtu ) . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this message with associated tables . cera ' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http : / / www . cera . com / event account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e - mail address , etc . go to : http : / / eprofile . cera . com / cfm / edit / account . cfm this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

"personal contact dear sir / madam , you may be surprise to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . the purpose of my mail is that i am mr . peter stevens , the second son of dr . dennis stevens , who was murdered some time ago in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i am writing from holland ( the netherlands ) where i am currently based as a political asylum seeker . before the death of my father , he took me to amsterdam in holland to deposit the sum of ( us $ 18 . 9 m ) eighteen million , nine hundred thousand united states dollars only , in a private security and finance company . may be he for - saw the looming danger in zimbabwe ? but this money was put in a box as gemstones before it was deposited to avoid much tax and demurrage from the security company . this money was initially meant to purchase new machines and chemicals for the farms and also to establish a new farm in swaziland . the land problem came when the government of zimbabwe under the leadership of president robert mugabe , introduced a new land use decree / act that , affected a lot of rich white farmers and some few blacks . this resulted to the mob action and killing by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society , so to say . infact , a lot of people were killed in this land reform act , including my father . it is against this back - ground , that i consulted with my family to transfer this money out of holland to a foreign account since i am now staying in holland and the law of netherlands , forbids a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to have such a money in an account . i am therefore saddled with the responsibility by my family to seek for a genuine person with foreign account to handle this transaction . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands because ; i will not like to go through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history . moreover , the netherlands foreign exchange does not allow such investment from asylum seekers . i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , you will need to come to amsterdam the netherlands to open a non resident account which will aid us in the transfer of the money into any account you will provide . this money is meant for investment purpose in any lucrative business of your choice . i have two options of offers for your assistance . you may go into partnership with me in any business you decides to invest the money on with the shearing of the profit carefully spelt out if agreed upon , or you may decide to have 20 % of the total sum , 70 % will be for me and my family and the remaining 10 % will be set aside for un - forseen expenses that may be incurred in the cause of pursuing this transaction to a successful end . you may contact me on the above medias so that i know what your decision is , about this proposal . please note that your field of specialization is not a hindreance to this transaction . thank for your anticipated co - operations . peter stevens .",Phishing Email

"hooooo....Cheers, RAH--- begin forwarded text Date: Thu, 5 Sep 2002 09:17:13 -0700 From: Same Guy Subject: Re: Electric car an Edsel... To: ""R. A. Hettinga"" Bob,This guy's an idiot.I design loads for systems with the 50 kV capacitors. One of those has 864 of such capacitors and stores only 10 megajoules, which means 11 kilojoules each. They weigh 125 kg.You need high energy per unit mass, and the capacitive system I picked maximizes that.It is precisely the system that Maxwell is touting for electrical braking and power augmentation for regenerative use in automobiles. You also need voltage you can use in a DC motor, which is why though the actual capacitors in the system are charged to 2.5 volts, the system has them arranged in series to boost the voltage.Ignore him. He's a waste of my time.------------------------ From: ""R. A. Hettinga"" Subject: Re: Electric car an Edsel...

That must be why 40kV is standard not 42. (the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW)Most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few real world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were talking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the ""capactior is the wrong choice"" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one, it's got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady discharge curve.But it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, not the 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For those you dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole atoms, not just electrons. Then you can suck off the electrons you need with a fuel cell. However, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel, and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design.- Adam L.

All you need is a machine configured to boot from CD-ROM and use a RAM disk for scratch space. Numerous Linux distros are available that let you boot a stateless but functional system from CD-ROM.> Obviously, you can't do this with partitions that accrue important > state, e.g. a partition that stores database table data.... but if you *do* want some state to persist, then you need a mountable writable partition. To protect it, you need some kind of access control management to decide who can do what to the writable partition, blah blah blah ... and before you know it, the security problem starts to look just like it does for conventional servers.Simple approxmation to this: make /usr a separate partion, and mount it read-only: * The good news: attackers that want to trojan your software have to reboot, at least. * The bad news: administrators that want to update your software have to reboot, at least.Crispin-- Crispin Cowan, Ph.D. Chief Scientist, WireX http://wirex.com/~crispin/ Security Hardened Linux Distribution: http://immunix.org Available for purchase: http://wirex.com/Products/Immunix/purchase.html",Safe Email
"HELLO...By reading the short Summary just below, you

same time, earn $100,000 or more to enable you to

and start earning some serious money.  You will learn new
skills in communications and how to market on the internet.
What a Deal!  Your total cash investment is just $50.00.Step 1.  If this is the first time you have seen this message,

Guides on communications.  For each Guide that you will
be ordering and buying, write out on a sheet of plain white

into an envelope, address the envelope with the name and
address of the person whose name is shown under each
Guide below, and mail the envelope by first class or air

envelopes.  No need to send by registered mail.LIST OF FIVE NAMES****************************

________________________________________________
END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these
Guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be
ordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and
you will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.Step 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name and
address of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that
slot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4's
slot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.
Check the address again.Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and
replace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and
replace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This
step is how your own name and address is entered into the
list of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,
your own name will go down the list of names until you have
reached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The
key point is that the number of people ordering Guides from
you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send out
this new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to
as many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000
emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings
you make, potentially the greater the number of people who
will order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then
make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email
showing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of
this email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 steps
shown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as
many emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help
those who purchase the Guides from you to send out
emails of their own.Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediate
reaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list
with the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.
That might seem to you like a clever move because new
buyers will be sending their money to these people.  But
that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.
What will benefit you most is having people who will send
out emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new
buyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going to
be sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself by
effectively closing down the program with your name on
top of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There
wouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver
will gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have done
the work, and your name has worked its way to further
down the list, by then you deserve the rewards and
earnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for
anyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don't
do it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to
the five people on the list that one of the people will just
take your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, rest
assured.  As we said above, it's to our benefit to have you
as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find
new buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try to
cheat you or to ""stiff"" you for $10.00.  The people on the list
would rather have you working hard because your effort will
benefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers send
you the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal
by sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat.
Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.
******END OF SUMMARY************************=======REST OF MESSAGE======================With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in
this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary
people who may not have done any internet marketing before.
And the earnings potential is staggering!READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a
RECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can
afford to buy that new car or home that you have been
looking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never
responded to one of these before either. One day though,
something made me feel: ""You use $50 going to a movie
for 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple
meat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?""  No matter where
you believe those ""feelings"" came from, I thank every day
that feeling came over me.I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing
had I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,
YouÂ’ll learn how to become a more effective communicator.
What can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and
confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover
your investment and make some good money: making over
half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.
If you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct
marketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing
via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done
in the future, then the experience you will gain here could
be a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing
a new career for you.= PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =If you want to make serious money, read this message until
you understand it completely and feel confident to follow
through on what it advises.FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,
it will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You
are offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such
and you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period
of time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and
the others on the list of five.===========================================
*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,
and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER
CHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY
===========================================Let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that
you and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.
Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%
(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better
but let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will
send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only
5,000 each.Out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only
5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also
send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of
those 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.
That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.Those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders
for Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each
for a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response
is 625 orders for Guide # 4.Those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total
of 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125
orders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  This
may seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a
very low response rate with a small number of emails being
sent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate
up just slightly.If Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)If Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795If Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone
or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
emails each or more?  From the example above, you can see
the power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the
amount of money from a small increase in the response rate.There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide
and counting, with thousands more coming online every day.METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
===========================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are
Many FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on
the internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start
with  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.
For every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the
Guide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.The people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise
you how to get the large number of email addresses that
you need to send the new email containing your name and
address.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,
you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to
their email addresses.  This will benefit you because your
name would be further down the list, and their new buyers
will buy from you.  This is no different than ""customer
service"" in the retail or the  ""bricks and mortars"" business.===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or
somehow  ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks
or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it
is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope
and steal it before it gets to you.ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each
Guide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden
by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of
those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME
of the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS
and your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the
envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to
mail the envelope.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW
FROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL
________________________________________________
YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1
within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.=== Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,
you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If
not, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,
YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, and
cash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT
TO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice
and instruction on how to send out more emails. You can
KEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people
are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE
MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.
There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!

"needles / topock price differentials i have had a casual chat with some of my accounts regarding their opinion of the market dynamics affecting the needles to topock price differentials . each customer focused more on the supply side dynamics of topock gas supplies , rather than the incremental intra - state transport costs required to transport to the pg & e citygate , as the primary driving force for the needles to topock price differential . here is a recurring theme i heard from my customers : the el paso merchant service ( epms ) 1 . 2 bcf contract ' s block ii capacity ( 500 mmcf / d of permian to pg & e / topock capacity , $ . 065 transport rate ) has a re - callable aspect . if epms schedules gas under the transport of block ii capacity to any other california delivery point other than pg & e / topock , then other parties may recall the capacity for their own use to pg & e / topock . currently duke has recalled 100 mmcf / d and pg & e energy trading has also recalled 100 mmcf / d for their use to transport permian gas to pg & e / topock . ( fyi - epmc may re - recall this capacity , but they have elected not to ) . these additional topock supplies coming from duke and pg & e energy trading under block ii capacity may be viewed as providing an oversupply of gas to pg & e at topock . this gas competes head to head with malin gas prices . for example , today ' s malin price is $ 4 . 62 while pg & e / topock price is $ 4 . 69 . today ' s cash price differential between needles and topock is $ . 60 , far larger than the previously assumed $ . 28 differential resulting from the intrastate cost required to bring topock gas to the citygate . if anyone else had additional market information or opinions regarding these market dynamics , let ' s discuss further at our next staff meeting . cs",Safe Email

"language policy admittedly , i ' m coming in on the middle of this discussion , having missed the earlier messages . however , i was struck by m . hale 's disturbing feelings about "" references to such ( non-linguistic ) issues as "" citizenship "" and "" ethnicity "" "" . how can you manage a language planning project without taking into consideration such non-linguistic factors , in addition to a study of language attitudes , government policies past and present , language of education and social mobility , etc . etc . ? and something else to think about perhaps . . . while the language planner ( s ) might not favor legal restrictions outright , the legal promotion of a language or languages , which seems like the opposite course , could actually lead to unofficial restrictions of the other language ( s ) . someone mentioned the case of spanish and english in the us . last week i heard a radio ( npr ? ) news report that some monolingual english speakers can't find work in the miami area because they do n't speak spanish ( the report was in reference to a politician 's support of making english the official language of the us ) . at a national / federal level , one could argue that spanish is a minority language ; at a local / city level , one could argue that it is not . do we have here a case of the promotion of spanish leading to unofficial restrictions on english - speakers , at least at a city level , in terms of employment opportunities ? my point is that the definition of "" minority language "" is going to depend on the specific situation . i am currently involved in a small-scale language planning project ( in the capacity of director ) and the toughest decisions i come across have to do with the "" non-linguistic "" factors : the people , the emotions , the feelings and the ideas they have towards the other people who do n't speak their language . even a small project is extremely complex . deborah du bartell , ph . d . linguistics program edinboro university of pennsylvania edinboro , pa 16444 usa 814-732 - 2736",Safe Email

just doing	Seq_Del $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) $resultsseems unnecessary to me (that's all that PickMarkSeen does after all).
(That can be done via ""busy"")Of course, the same is true of the badly named Pick_MarkSeen which has
nothing at all to do with ""pick"" except that it (ab)uses the pick(ids) var
in the same way.   (Its name would be hard to change unfortunately, as it
is known in app-defaults files for the ""Catch Up Unseen"" menu item, but
its implementation could certainly be fixed).kre_______________________________________________

"sum : wh animal i recently asked about whether one says ' who ' or ' what ' to ask what variety of animal in contexts such as : a . a person walks into a room with a swollen arm . you say : ' wh - bit you ? ' or b . you see an animal disappearing into the woods . you say : ' wh - is that ? ' the following languages ( thanks to the people listed for the info ) seem to use ' what ' only , although in context a gave some of the respondents did not like either alternative . greek ( a speaker who wished not to be identified by name ) finnish , swedish ( jussi karlgren ) english , hebrew ( david gil ) dutch , french ( bert peeters ) georgian ( ivan derzhanski ) german ( john peterson ) norwegian , swedish ( marit julien ) danish ( soren harder ) i would add polish to this list , based on my own judgements . ivan derzhanski adds bulgarian to the list , his testimony being particularly valuable , since he feels a clear contrast between bulgarian and russian here , but greg gouzev says that he would use ' who ' in context a ( but not b ) . on the other hand , dale russell reports that in cheyenne : "" people are all animate , but so are rocks , trees and leaves ( but not branches ) and the sun . animals are all animate , so far as i know . some body parts are animate , roughly those that are voluntarily movable . noses are not animate , fingers are . if you point to a rock and ask "" what is this ? "" , a native speaker will correct you , and say "" who is this ? "" , then answer the question - - at least that was my experience , in a field-methods type language learning experience . "" jonathan bobaljnik reports that itel ' men sometimes uses ' who ' and sometimes ' what ' for referring to animals . unfortunately , there 's very little data on the language , so i can't be very specific about the conditions determining which you get when . the clearest example of a language that uses ' who ' is russian ( in a striking contrast to closely related polish and bulgarian ) , as stated in standard works on this language and confirmed to me by alex eulenberg , ari solovyova , and ivan derzhanski ( but i must add that daniel radzinski reports that at least one speaker he spoke with gave different judgements ) . i find particularly interesting the fact that russian linguists working on other languages routinely note this difference between russian and whatever language they are describing ( i have seen this probably dozens of times in russian grammars or dictionaries of various languages of the former empire ) . barbara abbott noted a reference i had missed : chomsky 's in _ current issues in linguistic theory _ ( mouton , 1964 ) , p . 40 , notes that we cannot say "" what is eating its dinner ? ( the cat or the dog ) "" , and that ' who ' is also not natural in that context . a lot of the respondents indicated similar difficulties in other languages . i have not kept track of these , but they include french , danish , etc . , as noted by various respondents ( including frank gladney on english ) . cathy ball says that older forms of english sometimes use ' what are you ?

"coling / acl workshop on multilingual information management : report coling - acl ' 98 workshop multilingual information management : current levels and future abilities august 16 , 1998 universite de montreal montreal / canada the coling / acl workshop on multilingual information management is a follow-on to an nsf - sponsored workshop held in conjunction with the first international conference on language resources and evaluation in granada , spain ( may 1998 ) . the goal of the workshop was to consider the recent history and likely near-term future of a number of research areas pertaining to language that are related ( but still semi-independent at present ) . the conclusions have been gathered into a report , to be submitted to the nsf , le , and other funding agencies in europe and north america , for their consideration in setting funding policies and goals . the draft report is now available at http : / / www . cs . cmu . edu / ~ ref / mlim / at the granada workshop , an international panel of invited experts focused on a set of questions in an attempt to identify the most likely and most effective future directions of computational linguistics research - especially in the context of the need to handle multi-lingual and multi - modal information . the coling workshop , a follow-on , has the aim of opening the discussion to the computational linguistics community as a whole , to solicit the comments , additions , feedback , and contributions of everyone . to register , consult the coling / acl home page at http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / workshop description the development of natural language applications which handle multi - lingual and multi-modal information is the next major challenge facing the field of computational linguistics . over the past 50 years , a variety of language-related capabilities has been developed in areas such as machine translation , information retrieval , and speech recognition , together with core capabilities such as information extraction , summarization , parsing , generation , multimedia planning and integration , statistics-based methods , ontologies , lexicon construction and lexical representations , and grammar . the next few years will require the extension of these technologies to encompass multi-lingual and multi-modal information . extending current technologies will require integration of the various capabilities into multi-functional natural language systems . however , there is today no clear vision of how these technologies could or should be assembled into a coherent framework . what would be involved in connecting a speech recognition system to an information retrieval engine , and then using machine translation and summarization software to process the retrieved text ? how can traditional parsing and generation be enhanced with statistical techniques ? what would be the effect of carefully crafted lexicons on traditional information retrieval ? the workshop is organized as a series of discussion sessions , each one devoted to one aspect of computational language , initiated by a report of the discussions at the granada workshop ( a report summarizing the discussions at granada is available ; see below ) . enough time for discussion has been scheduled . the discussion will focus on the following fundamental questions : 1 . what is the current level of capability in each of the major areas of the field dealing with language and related media of human communication ? 2 . how can ( some of ) these functions be integrated in the near future , and what kind of systems will result ? 3 . what are the major considerations for extending these functions to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information , particularly in integrated systems of the type envisioned in ( 2 ) ? in particular , we will consider these questions in relation to the following areas : o multi-lingual resources ( lexicons , ontologies , corpora , etc . ) o information retrieval , especially cross-lingual and cross-modal o machine translation , of text and speech o automated ( cross-lingual ) information extraction and summarization o methods and techniques ( both statistics-based and linguistics-based ) o speech recognition and synthesis o multimedia communication , as well as language and speaker identification o evaluation and assessment techniques for each of these areas o government policy for future funding the initial findings of the report will form the basis of the discussion . the draft report is now available at http : / / www . cs . cmu . edu / ~ ref / mlim / major points raised in the discussions will be recorded and included in the report . we eagerly seek your feedback , comments , contributions , and assistance , to make this report as comprehensive and as accurate as possible ! program 9 : 00 - 9 : 10 welcome and overview 9 : 10 - 9 : 55 cross - lingual and cross - modal information retrieval moderator : judith klavans 9 : 55 - 10 : 40 information extraction and automated text summarization moderator : eduard hovy 10 : 40 - 11 : 00 break 11 : 00 - 11 : 45 methods and techniques moderator : nancy ide 11 : 45 - 12 : 30 machine translation of text and speech moderator : bente maegaard 12 : 30 - 2 : 00 lunch 2 : 00 - 2 : 45 multilingual resources moderator : martha palmer 2 : 45 - 3 : 30 speech recognition and synthesis moderator : tba 3 : 30 - 4 : 00 break 4 : 00 - 4 : 45 evaluation and assessment moderator : john white 4 : 45 - 5 : 30 multimedia communication and language / speaker identification moderator : oliviero stock 5 : 30 - 6 : 00 government : development policy and funding moderator : antonio zampolli the report the outcome of the granada and montreal workshops is a report , originally commissioned by the nsf , to be submitted to the nsf , le , and other funding agencies in europe and north america . the first draft of the report is available at http : / / www . cs . cmu . edu / ~ ref / mlim / we eagerly seek your feedback , comments , contributions , and assistance in making this report as comprehensive and as accurate as possible ! organizers robert frederking center for machine translation carnegie - mellon university schenley park pittsburgh , pa 15213-3890 tel : + 1-412 - 268-6656 fax : + 1-412 - 268-6298 email : ref @ nl . cs . cmu . edu eduard hovy information sciences institute of the university of southern california 4676 admiralty way marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 tel : + 1-310 - 822-1511 fax : + 1-310 - 823-6714 email : hovy @ isi . edu nancy ide department of computer science vassar college 124 raymond avenue poughkeepsie , ny 12604-0520 usa tel : + 1-914 - 437 5988 fax : + 1-914 - 437 7498 email : ide @ cs . vassar . edu joseph mariani limsi-cnrs bp 133 91403 orsay cedex france tel : + 33 - 1-69 - 85-8085 fax : + 33 - 1-69 - 85-8088 email : mariani @ limsi . fr antonio zampolli ilc-cnr via della faggiola 32 56100 pisa italy fax : + 39-50 - 556285 email : pisa @ ilc . pi . cnr . it - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - eduard hovy email : hovy @ isi . edu usc information sciences institute tel : 310-822 - 1511 ext 731 4676 admiralty way fax : 310-823 - 6714 marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 project homepage : http : / / www . isi . edu / natural-language / nlp-at - isi . html",Safe Email

 CNETÂ TECH982.84 Â -24.59Techs lose again with Seibel earnings miss, AOL questions
Siebel Systems fell short of Wall Street's earnings expectations and offered a worse-than-expected outlook, helping to depress technology shares Thursday.Despite a forecast from IBM in line with analyst expectations, investors seemed more focused on reports of a possible management shake-up at AOL Time Warner and on a Washington Post story questioning accounting methods at America Online. CNET's Tech index shed 24.59 points, or 2.45 percent, to close at 982.84. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 40.30 points, or 2.88 percent, to close at 1,356.95.Amid news The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators held steady in June, broader markts also headed south. The Dow Jones industrials dropped 133.0 points, or 1.56 percent, to close at 8,409.4. The S&P 500 slid 24.48 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 881.56--another multi-year low.
AOL used unconventional business practices-Post 
America Online Inc. boosted its revenue figures through unconventional deals from 2000 to 2002, before and after its acquisition of Time Warner Inc., the Washington Post reported on Thursday.A chart printed in conjunction with the Post article shows a total of $270.1 million in unconventional deals.AOL TIME WARNER INC 12.45 -5.03% IBM posts sharp drop in quarterly profits 
International Business Machines Corp. on Wednesday said it eked out a second-quarter profit of just a few pennies a share as the world's largest computer maker took a $1.4 billion charge to exit money-losing businesses and cut jobs.But even without the big charge, earnings at IBM, which sells everything from computer software to microchips to computer services, fell sharply as corporations concerned about their own bottom lines cut back on technology spending.INTL BUSINESS MACHINES 72.05 1.92% Nokia sees slight rise in Q3 handset sales vs Q2 
Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia said on Thursday it expected a slight rise in handset unit sales for both itself and the industry in the third quarter versus the April-June period.""it will be a reasonable quarter, but it will not represent such a dramatic growth as what might have been seen in some previous years,"" Chief Executive Jorma Ollila told a conference call following the firm's second-quarter result.NOKIA CORP ADS 13.33 -5.59%

J.P. Morgan stays cautious toward Qwest in tech notes 7/18/02 
Analyst Marc Crossman repeats a ""market performer"" rating on the telecom firm and further lowers his estimates on what he sees as continued deterioration of Qwest's local and long-distance businesses. Crossman says Qwest could violate a bank agreement by the end of this quarter if it doesn't close a significant asset sale. And he argues the firm faces a funding shortage next year that can't be satisfied by selling its eastern directories businesses alone.QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTL INC 2.74 14.64%

"the evaluation of parsing systems - workshop call for papers the evaluation of parsing systems a workshop jointly organised by the cec language engineering 1 projects sparkle and ecran to be held at the first international conference on language resources and evaluation granada , spain , 26 may 1998 this workshop will provide a forum for researchers interested in the development and evaluation of natural language grammars and parsing systems , and in the creation of syntactically annotated reference corpora . organisers : john carroll , roberto basili , nicoletta calzolari , robert gaizauskas , gregory grefenstette workshop scope and aims the aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussion of evaluation methods for parsing systems , and proposals for the development of syntactically annotated language resources . with increased attention to evaluation of component technology in language engineering , evaluation of parsing systems is rapidly becoming a key issue . numerous methods have been proposed and while one , the parseval / penn treebank scheme , has gained wide usage , this has to some extent been due to the absence of workable alternatives rather than to whole-hearted support . parseval / ptb evaluation has several limitations and drawbacks , including a commitment to a particular style of grammatical analysis , and oversensitivity to certain innocuous types of misanalysis while failing to penalise other common types of more serious mistake . also , the original published description of the scheme - - and the evaluation software widely distributed as a follow-up to it - - is specific to the english language . it may be that there are currently no alternative more workable schemes or proposals , but this needs to be more fully discussed : this workshop will provide an opportunity for such a debate . this workshop is particularly timely given the large number of cec language engineering projects that involve parsing in one form or another and which need to evaluate and share the results of their efforts . parsing is an essential part of many larger applications , such as information extraction , which have gained in importance over the last few years . often in such systems , the strength of the parser and grammar has a direct effect on the desired results , and thus achieving good results rests on being able to determine and improve weaknesses in the parser / grammar . without a reliable parser evaluation method this cannot be done effectively . a parsing evaluation workshop is also appropriate at this time given the imminent creation of large-scale syntactically annotated resources for european languages . contributions from those involved in such activities are welcomed , so as to improve communication between the resource construction and the resource utilisation communities . this should ensure that the resources constructed are maximally useful to the general language engineering community . the organisation of this workshop brings together two european language engineering projects which are closely related and whose partners share similar research interests : sparkle and ecran . the organisers solicit contributions from the general community on the following topics : - descriptions of generic syntactic annotation schemes - methodologies and metrics for parsing system evaluation - reports and analyses of the results of utilising particular parser evaluation schemes - description / analysis / experience of language-dependent ( especially for languages other than english ) and task-dependent syntactic annotation schemes programme committee roberto basili gregory grefenstette ted briscoe mark hepple nicoletta calzolari tony mcenery john carroll maria teresa pazienza roberta catizone paola velardi robert gaizauskas yorick wilks paper submission papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . submission may be in either hard copy or electronic form . the submission deadline is february 15th , 1998 . hard copy submission : three copies of the paper should be sent to : dr john carroll cognitive and computing sciences university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh uk electronic submission : electronic submission may be in either self-contained latex , postscript , or rtf formats , to john . carroll @ cogs . susx . ac . uk . for each submission -

bert , jr . chairman federal energy regulatory commission 888 first street , ne washington dc , 20426 dear chairman h ? bert : since last summer , the committee on energy and commerce has closely monitored the electricity situation in california . today , the west continues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century , and california faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again this summer . after extensive review of the energy crisis in the west , including several hearings in washington and california , we recommend that the commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity prices and keep power flowing into california . we recognize the commission ' s efforts in recent months to address the electricity crisis in the california and western markets , including measures to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices . while we are pleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout the west , we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale electricity prices on consumers and economic growth in california and the entire west in the hot summer months to come . to ensure that prices are just and reasonable during the critical months ahead , we believe the commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices in western markets . we strongly urge the commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other market participants within the entire western systems coordinating council ( wscc ) . specifically , such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesale electricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout the wscc . the plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages and failures to comply with agreements to sell power . if the commission finds that a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan , it should strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the full extent allowed by law . aware of the danger of discouraging supply , the commission has relied upon market - oriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would exacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts . we share the commission ' s concerns regarding the need to encourage supply . accordingly , to prevent blackouts and contribute to a long - term solution , the commission ' s comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as appropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging availability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission . to mitigate prices and increase available supply , we also urge the commission to take every additional step within its authority to promote conservation and demand response throughout the western market . in states where retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs , consumers have less incentive to conserve . while demand reduction incentives are not a substitute for accurate price signals , a demand response program can encourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity . such a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both wholesale and retail consumers to sell , at market or other incentive prices , "" foregone "" electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume . specifically , the commission should : ( 1 ) establish or certify a wholesale "" clearinghouse "" for demand reduction agreements ; and ( 2 ) enable consumers , whether individually or through aggregation arrangements , to sell foregone power to their own local distribution utility or to third - party purchasers . we recognize that individual states and utilities are implementing demand reduction programs , but a broader , regional solution is needed to enable sufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer . we understand that such a program can be implemented without preempting state laws , abrogating existing contracts , or shifting costs to non - participant consumers . we look forward to working with you to build upon the commission ' s previous efforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for consumers in california and the west this summer and thereafter . to ensure maximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead , we request that you take appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as possible . we request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not later than the close of business on friday , june 22 . if you have questions please contact our staff . thank you in advance for your cooperation with this request . sincerely , w . j .

"wholes and their parts wholes and their parts ( w / p ) bolzano , maretsch castle , 17-19 june 1998 1 . presentation science is connected to the complementarity of analysis and synthesis . it may be said that classical physics is characterized by an in-built analysis of the world into constituent parts ( such as atoms or elementary particles ) . these are then recomposed together to provide , by means of synthesis , any system ; interactions are linearly and locally described ; the resulting hierarchy of structures is grounded on such constituent parts . in contemporary science , the age of "" pure "" analysis seems to have ended . there are deep mathematical reasons for this . non - linear systems have properties that , in general , cannot be expressed in terms of decomposition into ultimate , unstructured , pointlike parts plus a suitable sets of relations among them . moreover , the "" dialectic "" of quantity and quality is subtler than was previously thought and this dialectic is needed in the explanation of all sorts of phenomena . it arises not only in physics , but also in the study of cognitive systems and natural and programming languages . within psychology , it is said that "" gestalten "" are cohesive wholes and that "" the whole is more than the sum of its parts "" . but what does this mean exactly ? similar questions emerge in other contexts as well . what is relevant for the foundations of science , the need for a clear understanding of the part / whole relationships , emerges even in logic and mathematics , since these provide the tools for organizing our rational image of the world , in its multi-stratified complexity . thus , we are faced with the problem of relating in a possibly coherent way the various forms of part / whole relationships arising in different branches of science . we have not only to classify the different kinds of wholes and their inherent "" grammars "" , but also to take into account the process of formation for wholes , in order to describe precisely in which sense the whole emerges out of its parts and is irreducible to an aggregate of autonomous , more or less pointlike , entities . what makes ( in part , at least ) the difference between mere aggregates and cohesive wholes ? the members of the whole do not simply hang together : they hang together in the whole , and the structure of the whole influences the description of the parts and their local interactions . in view of the growing interest in this sort of pattern , of so deep relevance for theoretical and applied sciences , it is therefore suitable to clarify the whole / part issues in crucial fields of research , to compare different approaches and to develop a foundational discussion . 2 . program june 17 9 registration 10 bill lawvere , opening lecture 11 , 30 coffee break 12 john bell , w / p in algebraic and logical structures 13-15 lunch 15 ieke moerdjik , w / p in geometry , topology and topos theory 16 coffee break 16 , 30 colin mclarty , w / p in foundations of mathematics 17 , 30 carlo cellucci , w / p in logical analysis june 18 9 steve vickers , w / p in semantics for programming languages 10 gonzalo reyes , w / p in categorical analysis of language 11 coffee break 11 , 30 john mayberry , w / p in set theory 12 , 30-15 lunch 15 niles eldredge , w / p in biology 16 coffee break 16 , 30 alberto peruzzi , w / p in epistemology and semantics 17 , 30 roberto poli , w / p in ontology june 19 9 ettore casari , w / p in phenomenology 10 alf zimmer , w / p in gestalt psychology 11 coffee break 11 , 30 ron langacker , w / p in linguistics 12 , 30-15 lunch 15 george lakoff , w / p in cognitive sciences ( to be confirmed ) 16 coffee break 16 , 30 chris isham , w / p in quantum topology 17 , 30 basil hiley , w / p in mechanics and cosmology 3 . updates to keep you updated with more information on the conference this is the url for the w / p home page : http : / / www . gelso . unitn . it / ~ poli / 4 . registration fees registration fees only cover the participation in this conference . miscellaneous expenses ( accomodation , meals and social activities ) are in addition . the registration deadline to get the early registration fare is : march 1998 , 31st . students must enclose with the registration form a photocopy of their student card . status early registration ( before 3 / 31 / 98 ) late registration student 50 , 000 100 , 000 scholar 100 , 000 200 . 000 industrial 200 , 000 300 . 000 5 . accomodation participants should book their own accomodation . a selected hotel list is the following one : parkhotel laurin * * * * . 4 , laurinstrasse single-room and breakfast : 180 , 000-265 , 000 tel . + 39 471 31 10 00 , fax + 39 471 31 11 48 citta \ 146 * * * . 21 , waltherplatz single-room and breakfast : 110 , 000 tel . + 39 471 97 52 21 ;

"the ipa market "" alexis mr "" urges that phonetic alphabets be standardized , and writes , "" why not let the invisible hand of the "" market "" of ideas operate freely ? "" but the market * is * operating . that 's exactly why we have several different systems , any that 's why people feel free to modify those systems as they please . i do not see how the market would demand i asked in an earlier egram ( vol-6 - 199 ) why it would benefit me , as an active fieldworker , to have a completely revamped phonetic alphabet . i am still waiting for a plausible answer . i am happy with ipa most of the time , and when i ' m not i innovate as necessary . a complete overhaul would be wrenching for me and probably leave me feeling extremely alientated . more likely , i would just go on using the ipa and chinese ipa symbols i already use , and the dubious goal of a new , unified standard phonetic system would fail . i think the real reason some people want to overhaul ipa is to alter its aesthetics - to make it neater , more symmetrical somehow . i do not see any practical value in this . nor do i see any need to have a single , unified system , replacing both ipa and american consensual practice . everybody recognizes esh , and everybody recognizes s-hachek , and if a letter _ y _ appears in a transcription you look carefully at the introduction and find out what it represents , that 's all . where is the problem ? please , someone tell me , where is the problem ? david prager branner , yuen ren society asian l&l , do-21 , university of washington seattle , wa 98195 ( charmii @ u . washington . edu )",Safe Email

"Hello all
I'm looking for advice. My pc has developed a disturbing tendency of trying
to access IP 62.17.143.253 without my consent. It has got to the stage where
normal web-browsing is almost impossible.
I have checked IP address on RIPE database and I know precisely who is being
called. I contacted that company on 14 July, when the problem first arose
and asked for a remedy but (surprise) got no reply.
A helpful person on the ie.comp list suggested Adaware spyware removal. I
ran this and haven't had a problem again until today.
The offending program is obviously not in Adaware db. (I run adaware with
current ref files every day now).
Any suggestions, please,  for removing whatever the f*** is causing this
from my pc?
Brian

"" deutsche banc alex . brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth - quarter projections for natural - gas prices last week . "" prior to sept . 11 , we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back , "" said jay saunders , a deutsche banc analyst . "" but all that is out the window now . "" deutsche banc is now estimating a 20 % drop in winter demand in the industrial sector , which accounts for more than a quarter of total u . s . natural - gas consumption . the slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage , which is on pace to be full by the end of october . while prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers , such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural - gas demand is met . lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms , such as eog resources inc . , plan to moderate production in the next two months . gas drilling - rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1 , 030 at the end of august . even with the increased natural - gas drilling of earlier this year , overall natural - gas supply is expected to increase just 1 % this year , as the country ' s mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them . the tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates , increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence . still , the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form . with prices high last winter , el paso corp . and enron corp . , among others , said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas , which is gas compressed and frozen to minus - 260 degrees fahrenheit . "" you will see some cancellations and some delays , "" predicts marshall adkins , an analyst with raymond james & associates in houston . natural - gas prices need to average $ 3 per million btus on the east coast and $ 3 . 50 on the west coast to justify bringing in lng to those areas , said ronald barone , an analyst with ubs warburg . a spokeswoman for el paso , houston , says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the u . s . market . enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the bahamas that would pipe the gas to florida starting in 2004 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron leases part of mumbai estate to citibank freny patel mumbai 10 / 02 / 2001 business standard 5 copyright ( c ) business standard after months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at wockhardt towers in bandra - kurla complex , enron has been able lease out 10 , 000 square feet of it to citibank na . against an expected realisation from rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors , enron will get around rs 1 . 2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to citibank . the deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant , cushman & wakefield , at a monthly rental of rs 100 per square foot . with property prices in mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the short run , companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets . property consultants say that if enron manages to lease out the entire four floors , it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer , as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income . enron had eyed a deal of rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around rs 12 , 000 per square foot . this is despite the fact that real estate at bandra kurla currently fetches rs 8 , 000 to rs 9 , 000 per square feet . in june 2000 , the us energy giant had shelled out rs 125 . 75 crore when it acquired the four floors , plus car park space , from wockhardt , the pharmaceutical company . the deal was struck at rs 10 , 500 per sq ft , and included parking space for 101 cars . industry sources said that enron had spent a sum close to rs 150 crore to acquire the property , and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired . in order for it to break even , it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of rs 13 , 000 per square foot . four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by enron for the sale of its premises . a leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property . "" most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase , "" he added . moreover , the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built - up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises , and enron ' s proposition continues to go abegging , said the consultant . copyright ? 2000 dow jones ranking includes 14 newcomers though hewlett - packard lost $ 65 billion in market value in a year , ceo carly fiorina hasn ' t lost her nerve , and for the fourth consecutive year holds the no . 1 position on fortune ' s ranking of the 50 most powerful women in business . the complete list and accompanying stories are in the october 15 issue of fortune , available on newsstands october 8 and at www . fortune . com at 12 : 00 p . m . on october 1 . in the no . 2 spot is ebay ceo meg whitman , who runs an internet company that actually makes money : $ 85 million in the last four quarters on $ 582 million in revenue . oprah winfrey , the queen of media , is mightier than ever , and holds the no . 3 spot , up from no . 15 last year . she produces movies , brings comfort and advice to millions of tv viewers , propels books to bestsellerdom , and , last year , teamed up with hearst magazines ' cathie black ( no . 28 on the list ) to publish o , the oprah magazine - by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever . at no . 4 is andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon , who has breathed life into ailing avon . mirant ceo marce fuller - the only newcomer in the top five - holds the no . 5 position . inside a stodgy utility , southern , fuller built a high - growth trading and marketing unit , which was spun off in april . in these new , more tempered times , patience may be about to reap its reward . in fortune ' s annual survey of the 50 most powerful women in business , there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly . says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in "" patient but not passive , "" the story that accompanies the list , "" by patience , we mean staying with a company , steadily building influence there , and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge , not promises and self - promotion . "" fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , "" people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , "" she says . as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah "" hurricane debby "" hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at the startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter . fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; janet davidson , group president , integrated network solutions , lucent ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon . while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : "" we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . "" the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first . in a related story , "" it took a lady to save avon , "" katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , "" jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . "" over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins . in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou -

Remember when I said that taking an afternoon off to march for Dmitri
was pissing in the wind and that to be really effective we needed
people willing to publically break the stupid laws right in the
face of the authorities?Well it seems Bruce Perens agrees with me, only he's going one better,
instead of just mouthing off about it, he's going to do it and do it 
in a big way ...
    Open source campaigner to risk jail
    By James Middleton [24-07-2002]    Bruce Perens plans live DVD hack    With the dust from the Elcomsoft/Sklyarov case still thick in the
    air, influential open source activist Bruce Perens plans to go one
    better by breaking the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA)
    during a live presentation on Friday.    Fresh from giving RealNetworks a slating for not completely
    backing open source with its latest announcement, Perens said that
    during a Digital Rights Management presentation to be held Friday
    at the O'Reilly developer conference in San Diego, he would break
    the law.    The DMCA has been a sore point in the open source community since
    the outlawing of DeCSS, a tool created so that DVDs could be
    played on Linux machines, and more recently since the arrest of
    Dmitry Sklyarov and the criminal charges faced by his employer,
    Elcomsoft.    Based on the recent history of DMCA contravention, Perens could
    face imprisonment or a $500,000 fine for his actions.    According to Infoworld the demonstration is to be carried out in
    protest at the regional system used by the motion picture industry
    to prevent DVDs released in one country being played on machines
    in another country.    During his presentation, Perens will demonstrate how to hack a DVD
    player so that it can play movies from any region.    ""It is a political and social statement, and the statement is that
    the people do not need to have a hall monitor living in their
    stereo system and should be able to play any kind of media on the
    device they wish,"" he was quoted as saying.    But luck may be on his side, if last year is anything to go by. At
    the same conference in 2001 Perens made a presentation on the
    triviality of Digital Rights Management systems using exactly the
    same slides that got Sklyarov arrested.http://www.vnunet.com/News/1133862--

"gene flow and indo - europeans h . m . hubey has made readers of this list aware of an interesting article which appeared in the june 24 , 1995 , issue of science news concerning evidence from dna data indicating a gene flow from anatolia into europe beginning around 9 , 000 years bp . hubey also points out that there is genetic evidence that nomads from the central eurasian yamna culture spread westward into europe approximately 5 , 500 years ago . while it is indeed reasonable to link the first migration with the spread of agriculture , it does not follow that those who migrated spoke any form of indo - european ( "" pre - "" , "" proto - "" , or dialects thereof ) . nor does it follow that "" [ i ] t is possible that both expansions were responsible for the spread of different subfamilies of indo - european languages . . . "" we know from cuneiform records that by 3 , 000 bce anatolia was populated ( at least in part , if not in full ) by people speaking caucasian languages . in eastern anatolia , hurrian and the later attested and closely-related urartean were spoken . these languages have been convincingly shown by sergej starostin and igor diakonoff to be related to northeast caucasian . in central anatolia , hattic was spoken - - this was later replaced by hittite , an indo - european language . diakonoff maintains that hattic was also a caucasian language . finally , diakonoff has claimed that the language spoken by the gutians ( qutians ) was a caucasian language . moreover , there are no unambiguous references to indo - european people or languages in written records from the ancient near east until just before 2 , 000 bce , and the first references are to hittites . it is generally agreed by specialists ( for example , gamkrelidze , mellaart , puhvel , steiner , among others ) that the hittites were invaders who imposed themselves upon populations speaking caucasian languages ( in particular , hattic ) . thus , there is much stronger evidence that prior to about 2 , 000 bce , anatolia was populated by speakers of caucasian languages than by speakers of indo - european languages . thus , it follows logically that if one were to attempt to correlate gene flow at about 9 , 000 bp from anatolia to europe with language spread that one would tend to think more about very early forms of caucasian rather than indo - european . allan r . bomhard boston , massachusetts",Safe Email

"effects of morphological case - - utrecht univ second call for papers effects of morphological case workshop to be held at the utrecht institute of linguistics ots , utrecht university , 28-29 august 1998 . organizers : helen de hoop , olaf koeneman , iris mulders , and fred weerman invited speakers : paul kiparsky , joan maling , alec marantz the aim of this workshop is to investigate the effects of morphological case that go beyond its mere phonological characteristics . in the gb model of the eighties , morphological case was considered a spell-out of abstract case . while abstract case is present in all languages , the spell-out is only in a subset . in such a view , the presence of morphological case may help to uncover more abstract features , but in itself it does not have syntactic or semantic effects . this runs counter to observations that the presence / absence of morphological case correlates with the presence / absence of certain syntactic and semantic properties . a case in point is the more or less classical observation that the presence of morphological case is related to the possibility for several types of scrambling . other approaches have been proposed to incorporate ( some of ) these effects of morphological case and the idea that parametric differences should be reducable to morphological properties has been defended with varying success . against this background , the present workshop seeks answers for questions like the following : what is the relation between morphological case and abstract case ? what are the distributional , interpretive and phonological effects of the presence of morphological case ? the aim of this workshop is to bring together theoretical and empirical considerations on the effects of morphological case . issues for discussion involve the implications of morphological case for abstract case theory , the difference between structural and inherent case , agreement , word order phenomena , grammaticalization processes , discourse theory , and semantics . we welcome contributions relating to all aspects of linguistics . in particular we are interested in comparative , diachronic and acquisitional evidence that shows that relations between morphological case and other aspects of the grammar do ( not ) exist . the program will include three invited lectures of experts on the topic of morphological case . the provisional titles are as follows : paul kiparsky ( stanford ) : ` cases as complementizers ' joan maling ( brandeis ) : ` morphological case is not ( always ) to blame ! ' alec marantz ( mit ) : ` in defense of "" spell-out "" : why morphological case should indeed have only an indirect reflective relation to the syntax ' the workshop has room for 13 selected talks of 35 minutes . authors should submit 5 copies of an anonymous abstract of no more than 2 pages , one camera-ready copy indicating the author 's name and a 3x5 "" card with the author 's name , address , affiliation , e-mail address , phone number , and the title of the paper . we hope to be able to ( partially ) reimburse all speakers . please send your abstracts to : workshop on morphological case utrecht institute of linguistics ots trans 10 3512 jk utrecht the netherlands the deadline for submission is april 1 , 1998 . authors will be notified of acceptance by may 15 . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * olaf koeneman * * utrecht institute of linguistics ots * * trans 10 ( room 2 . 20 ) , 3512 jk utrecht * * tel . + 31 30 253 8304 * * email : koeneman @ let . ruu . nl * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *",Safe Email

"workshop on complexity in language contact , acquisition and change newsletter 1 . workshop on complexity in language contact , acquisition and change . 8 september 1998 , paris , france . in colaboration with the cnrs ( centre national de recherche scientifique ) , the lot ( netherlands graduate school of linguistics ) is organizing some workshops to create a forum to encourage the discussion between researchers in linguistics from the netherlands and france . one of the workshops is initiated by members of the university of amsterdam and has as its subject : complexity in language contact , acquisition and change . the workshop will take place on tuesday the 8th of september , starting at 14 . 30 until approximately 20 . 00h . the theme although there is a kind of dogma that all natural languages are equally complex , at least for certain subsystems of language there may well be differences in complexity . in discussions of processes of language change and first and second language acquisition the notion of complexity plays an important role . especially in creole studies simplicity and complexity implicitly have been dominant issues in the debate , but are seldom properly scrutinized . in this workshop we want to discuss the role of complexity in these domains , including grammatical theory , first and second language acquisition , language change and language contact - in order to shed light on controversial problems invoked by the term complexity in linguistics in general . the structure of the workshop the workshop is organized around three themes : creole languages , language acquisition and language change . each theme will be discussed by researchers from france and the netherlands in 10 minutes presentations , inspired by the following propositions . after these short presentations there will be time for discussion in each session . 1 . all languages have the same "" costs / payment "" balance , i . e . if a language becomes phonologically more simple , its morphological system will become more complex . [ cf . haugen 1976 : 286 ] 2 . all complexity in languages resides in the lexicon . [ cf . aronoff 1995 ] 3 . languages spoken within small communities are more complex than languages of large communities . [ cf . whinnom 1980 , hymes 1971 , mhlhusler 1996 ] 4 . language shift will in general lead to simplification , while borrowing will lead generally to more complex structures . [ cf . thomason & kaufman 1988 ] 5 . complexity does not play a role in first language acquisition , but it does in second language acquisition . [ cf . trudgill 1992 ] 6 . grammaticalization leads to greater complexity .

by NICHOLAS LEMANN
He's the other Powell, and no one is sure what he's up to.
New Yorker, October 8, 2002Last year, my middle son, in eighth grade and encountering his first 
fairly serious American-history course, indignantly reported that the 
whole subject was incomprehensible. I was shocked. What about Gettysburg 
and the Declaration of Independence and the Selma-to-Montgomery march? 
Just look at my textbook, he said, and when I did I saw his point. His 
class had got up to the eighteen-forties. What I expected was a big 
beefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks, and, in-deed, 
there was some of that. But the main difference between my son's text 
and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous 
decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American 
history. There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and 
reciprocal trade agreements. I skipped ahead, past the Civil War, hoping 
for easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation 
of freight rates. Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it 
become possible to see the federal government's main function as 
responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice, 
instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic 
interests.Even now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty 
speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington, what you'd find 
is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so 
much over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real 
estate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. The arena in which 
this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and 
commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. It's 
an insider's game, less because the players are secretive than because 
the public and the pressâ€”encouraged by the players, who speak in jargonâ€”
can't get themselves interested.One corner of Washington might be called F.C.C. World, for the Federal 
Communications Commission. F.C.C. World has perhaps five thousand 
denizens. They work at the commission itself, at the House and Senate 
commerce committees, and at the Washington offices of the companies that 
the commission regulates. They read Communications Daily (subscription 
price: $3,695 a year), and every year around Christmastime they 
grumblingly attend the Chairman's Dinner, at a Washington hotel, where 
the high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly self-deprecating 
comedy routine by the commission's chairman.Of all the federal agencies and commissions, the F.C.C. is the one that 
Americans ought to be most interested in; after all, it is involved with 
a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the 
American economy, as well as important aspects of daily lifeâ€”telephone 
and television and radio and newspapers and the Internet. And right now 
F.C.C. World is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather, 
because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the 
""corporate scandals"" concerns the economic collapse of companies 
regulated by the F.C.C. Qwest, WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing, 
among others, are (or were) part of F.C.C. World. AOL Time Warner is 
part of F.C.C. World. Jack Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney 
analyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay, of Enron, as the 
embodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of F.C.C. World. In the 
past two years, companies belonging to F.C.C. World have lost trillions 
of dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a 
dead weight pulling down the entire stock market.This year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state 
of the F.C.C. has been circulating widely within F.C.C. World. It evokes 
F.C.C. World's feverish mood (""The F.C.C. is fiddling while Rome burns"") 
and suggests why nobody besides residents of F.C.C. World has thought of 
the commission in connection with the corporate scandals. The sentence I 
just quoted is followed by this explanation: ""The ILECs appear likely to 
enter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no 
residential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10% 
market share loss in business lines to CLECs."" It's a lot easier to 
think about evil C.E.O.s than to decipher that.
Even in good times, F.C.C. World pays obsessive attention to the 
commission's chairman. In bad times, the attention becomes especially 
intense; and when the chairman is a celebrity F.C.C. World devotes 
itself to full-time chairman-watching. The current chairman, Michael 
Powell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards, 
because he is the only son of Colin Powell, the Secretary of State. 
Unlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which 
generates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about 
who he really is and what he's really up to. Powell is young to be the 
head of a federal agencyâ€”he is thirty-nineâ€”and genially charming. 
Everybody likes him. Before becoming chairman, he was for three years 
one of the F.C.C.'s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the 
F.C.C.'s incomprehensible patois, he has a Clintonesque love of the 
arcane details of communications policy. He's always saying that he's an 
""avid moderate."" And yet he has a rage-inciting quality. One of his 
predecessors as chairman, Reed Hundt, quoted in Forbes, compared Powell 
to Herbert Hoover. Mark Cooper, of the Consumer Federation of America, 
calls him ""radical and extreme."" Just as often as he's accused of being 
a right-wing ideologue, Powell gets accused of being paralytically 
cautious. ""It ain't about singing 'Kum-Ba-Yah' around the campfire,"" 
another former chairman, William Kennard, says. ""You have to have an 
answer."" One day last spring, Powell, testifying before a Senate 
subcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the 
subcommittee's chairman, Ernest Hollings, of South Carolina, berated 
him. ""You don't care about these regulations,"" Hollings said. ""You don't 
care about the law or what Congress sets down. . . . That's the 
fundamental. That's the misgiving I have of your administration over 
there. It just is amazing to me. You just pell-mell down the road and 
seem to not care at all. I think you'd be a wonderful executive 
vice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a 
regulatory commission at the government level. Are you happy in your 
job?""""Extremely,"" Powell said, with an amiable smile.
One cannot understand Powell's maddening effect, at least on Democrats 
and liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose 
of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. The F.C.C. was 
created by Congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the 
New Deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy 
cases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure 
that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. Its 
other original function was preventing American Telephone & Telegraph, 
the national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers 
unfairly. Over the decades, as F.C.C. World grew up into a comfortable, 
well-established place, the F.C.C. segued into the role of industrial 
supervisionâ€”its real purpose. It was supposed to manage the competition 
among communications companies so that it didn't become too bloody, by 
artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. 
In addition to looking out for the public's interest, the commission 
more specifically protected the interests of members of Congress, many 
of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most 
terrifying category of interest groupâ€”you can cross the local bank 
president and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. 
According to an oft-told F.C.C. World anecdote, President Clinton once 
blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers 
in the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the 
anti-Clinton Little Rock Democrat-Gazette had owned the leading TV 
station in Little Rock, too, Clinton would never have become President.
F.C.C. World may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, 
because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic 
niches for themselves. Then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful 
breakup of A.T. & T.â€”by far the biggest and most important company the 
commission regulatedâ€”deposited a thick additional sediment of 
self-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation 
ago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one 
long-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, 
which customers were not permitted to ownâ€”and they were all the same 
company. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the 
mid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local 
phone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing 
to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores 
everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturersâ€”and 
millions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the 
telephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a ""natural 
monopoly,"" requiring protection from economic competition and total 
control over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, 
the F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones 
and the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: 
consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more 
prosperous, too.The next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 
one of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which 
most people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. 
Although the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of 
modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group 
bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers 
as ""baby Bells"" and to F.C.C. World as ""arbocks"" (the pronounced version 
of RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to 
offer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance 
companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for 
customers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would 
get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more 
competition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and 
economics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by 
Vice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as 
helping to reposition them as the technology partyâ€”the party that 
brought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of 
jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose 
beneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. Clinton's 
slogans about the ""information superhighway"" and ""building a bridge to 
the twenty-first century,"" which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully 
sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical 
correlates of the Telecom Act, and Gore's cruise to the Presidency was 
supposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.The F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, 
aggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like 
all important interest groups they work with both parties); they 
immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new 
competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through 
rule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by 
Reed Hundt, who was Gore's classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep 
the arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies 
like A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new 
companies, ""see-lecks"" (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive 
local exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory 
equivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have 
access to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the 
seeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the see-leck asks the 
F.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.Partly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that 
he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming 
condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the 
see-lecksâ€”companies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligentâ€”and 
into other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related 
technology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom 
boom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks 
and other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests 
of the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of Hundt's 
former lieutenants told me, ""Reed used to joke that my job was to make 
sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up.""
The years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the 
boom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more 
startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: 
Time Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and 
Comcast, and so on. (Surely, WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys 
believed that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative 
accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so 
undiscriminating.)By the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been 
determined, the telecom crash was well under way. Nonetheless, the 
chairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of 
influence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. 
Three Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner; 
Harold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and 
Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as 
such, a George W. Bush guy. In Texas, however, Wood had crossed the most 
powerful person in the arbock camp, Edward Whitacre, the C.E.O. of 
S.B.C. Communications, which is headquartered in San Antonio. This meant 
that the arbocks didn't want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he 
might be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he 
wasn't as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative 
movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than 
Furchtgott-Roth.Powell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared 
before a conservative group called the Progress & Freedom Foundation and 
gave a very Michael Powell speechâ€”whimsical, intellectual, and 
free-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore's Law)â€”that 
began by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new 
telecom companies alive. ""In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is 
often cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas,"" Powell said. ""Like the 
Whos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast 
beast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the 
deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act's 
fertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the 
least, so it is thought."" Thus Powell was indicating that if he became 
chairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as 
part of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day 
of the Bush Administration.Twenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead 
or dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in 
serious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite 
companies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically 
concentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing 
companies' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in 
good shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged 
companies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the 
financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications 
industry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells 
wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and 
if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national 
duopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. 
And these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the 
poor health of the long-distance companies.The cable business also seems close to having two dominant national 
companies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they 
don't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more 
fully control what material they allow to enter people's homes. As part 
of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 
Telecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were 
significantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of 
radio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five 
per cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news 
programming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary 
of Viacom.In this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should 
be hyperactiveâ€”the superhero of government regulation, springing to the 
rescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try 
to breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should 
disallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the 
forces of concentration. It should use the government's money and muscle 
to get new technologyâ€”especially fast Internet connectionsâ€”into the 
homes of people who can't afford it at current market prices. (An 
analogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and 
the Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush 
people, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush 
people blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many 
expectations and stirred too many passions.)But Michael Powell's F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been 
conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the 
F.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him 
signals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of 
the F.C.C.'s limits on media concentration.) This doesn't mean he has 
been inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further 
infuriates his criticsâ€”in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and 
the provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of 
F.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he's 
having the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, 
when he was asked what he was going to do about the ""digital 
divide""â€”that is, economic inequality in access to the Internetâ€”he said, 
""You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I'd like to have one and 
I can't afford one."" At the National Cable & Telecommunications 
Association convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of 
tumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a 
somersault.
Not long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until 
1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest 
Washington, near the city's open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at 
the western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody 
else at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building 
looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. 
Even the chairman's suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and 
fluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and 
walks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a 
jeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because 
of the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he 
became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly 
the idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of 
the market before the factâ€”""prophylactically,"" as he likes to sayâ€”should 
wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust 
litigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and 
then became a protÃ©gÃ© of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division 
of the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government's 
legal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of 
the New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell's political 
skill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush 
Administration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but 
also maintains close ties to Bush's nemesis Senator John McCain, of 
Arizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his 
enduring love of law schoolâ€”""It's sort of like a law-school study 
session over there,"" one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to 
confirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law 
students, summer interns at the commission, whom he'd invited to sit in.I began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions 
of the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the 
airwaves among themselves without the government being involved?""I think we'll never know,"" Powell said. ""I don't think it's an 
automatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably 
the best analogue. We don't seize all the land in the United States and 
say, 'The government will issue licenses to use land.' If my neighbor 
puts a fence one foot onto my property line, there's a whole body of law 
about what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If 
a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it's a 
similar proposition. There are scholars who argueâ€”indeed, the famous 
Ronald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about thisâ€”that 
spectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds 
of ways that we're accustomed to.""Talking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he 
doesn't seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He 
slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in 
ironic air quotes. He's like your libertarian friend in college who 
enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions 
about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he 
sees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he 
thought his predecessors' excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications 
Act had been excessive.""I would start with a caveat,"" Powell said. ""Look, I can't fault those 
judgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. 
They were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. 
But, frankly, I've always been a little bit critical. First of all, 
anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn't come anywhere close 
to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the President 
on down, about the kinds of things it's going to open up. I mean, I 
don't know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions, 
or what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that 
were a big part of the theatre of its introduction. When one starts 
reading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. 
But, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an Internet 
excitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it 
certainly was.""But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of 
expectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the 
economy or the market even gets in trouble. It was a dramatically 
exaggerated expectationâ€”by the leadership of the commission, by 
politicians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. It was a 
gold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones 
that government encouraged by its policies, frankly. Everybody wanted to 
see numbers go up on the board.""Powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act. "" 
'I want to see ten competitors. Twenty competitors! I want to see 
thirty-per-cent market share. Fifty-per-cent market share! I want the 
Bells to bleed! Then we'll know we've succeeded.' "" Now Powell returned 
to being Powell. ""I think that expectation was astonishingly 
unrealistic, in the short term. They wanted to see it while they're 
there. We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. And 
the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. There's no 
question, we went too soon too fast. Too many companies took on too much 
debt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business 
model.""How could the Telecom Act have been handled better? ""We could have 
chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were 
slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system,"" 
Powell said. ""Money chased what seemed like government-promised 
opportunity. The problem with that is there's a morning after, and we're 
in it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This 
debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. In some 
ways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability.""Powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there 
had been a more ""reasonable"" level of investment. ""No, we wouldn't have 
every home in America with competitive choice yetâ€”but we don't anyway. I 
don't think it's the remonopolization of telephone service. I don't buy 
that. The Bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn't? The 
part of the story that didn't materialize was that people thought so 
would MCI WorldCom and Sprint.""Other local phone companies, he added, hadn't materialized as viable 
businesses, either, and they never might. ""Everybody's always saying, 
'The regulators did this and this and this.' But, candidly, the story's 
quite the opposite. I think the regulators bent over backward for six 
years to give them a chance. Conditions don't get that good except once 
every thirty years, and it didn't happen. So, whatever the reason, we're 
looking at a WorldCom that's teetering. We're looking at a long-distance 
business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. A.T. & T. is 
breaking itself up. Sprint has struggled.""Could the F.C.C. have done anything to make the long-distance companies 
stronger? ""At the F.C.C.? I think I'll just be blunt. My political 
answer? Yes, there's all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try 
to help. But I can't find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere. 
I can't mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S.E.C. 
investigation. Were I king, it would be wonderful, but I don't have 
those kinds of levers. I don't know whether anybody does. At some point, 
companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from 
dying."" Powell couldn't have made it much clearer that he doesn't think 
it's his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. He has 
demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist 
gesturesâ€”in August, for example, five months after disbanding the 
F.C.C.'s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was 
appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the 
communications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding 
out the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore 
up the telecom industry.I asked Powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one 
company provided cable television and only one provided local phone 
service. ""Yes,"" he said. ""It concerns us that there's one of each of 
those things, but let's not diminish the importance of there being one 
of each of those things. That still is a nice suite of communications 
capabilities, even if they aren't direct analogues of each other."" 
Anyway, Powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to 
provide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will 
provide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. 
""So, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. The question 
is, Does it stay that way?""The concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of 
information did not appear to trouble Powell, either. He said that 
people confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, 
which distorts markets. ""If this were just economics, it's easy. If you 
were to say to me, 'Mike, just worry about economic concentration,' we 
know how to do thatâ€”the econometrics of antitrust. I can tell you when a 
market's too concentrated and prices are going to rise. The problem is 
other dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. Take 
the question of, if everybody's controlling what you see, the assumption 
there is that somehow there'll be this viewpoint, a monolithic 
viewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won't get diversity. I 
think that's a possibility. I don't think it's nearly the possibility 
that's ascribed to it sometimes.""Powell explained, ""Sometimes when we see very pointed political or 
parochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. I see some of the 
same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh 
exists. They love diversity, but somehow we should run Howard Stern off 
the planet. If it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, 
and then we have policies like""â€”here his tone went from ironic to 
sarcasticâ€”""the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis 
of what I thought those people cared about. So when somebody is pointed 
and opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic 
fairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out.""
F.C.C. World abounds in theories about Michael Powell. One is that he 
can't make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries 
he regulatesâ€”so he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the 
market, in order to buy himself time. Another is that he's carrying 
water for the arbocks and the big cable companies. Another is that he is 
planning to run for the Senate from Virginia (or to be appointed 
Attorney General in a second Bush term), and doesn't want to do anything 
at the F.C.C. that would diminish his chances. Another is that he's 
waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action, 
so that he doesn't wind up going first and getting caught in the 
crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television 
networks. (In F.C.C. World, this is known as the Powell Doctrine of 
Telecom, after Colin Powell's idea that the United States should never 
commit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force, 
and an exit strategy.) And another is that he actually believes what he 
says, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and 
irreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.""This is why elections matter,"" Reed Hundt, who isn't happy about what 
has become of his Telecom Act, told me. It's true that the F.C.C.â€”much 
more than, say, the war in Afghanistanâ€”is a case in which a Gore 
Administration would be acting quite differently from the Bush 
Administration. Consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but 
there's no question whether communications companies have noticed. The 
arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would 
have done if Gore had won. Next election, they'll help the party that 
helped them. If the Republicans win, policy will tilt further in the 
arbocks' favor. If they lose, perhaps the arbocks' rivalsâ€”the 
long-distance companies and the telecommunications upstartsâ€”with their 
friends now in power, will stage a comeback. America's present is not 
unrecognizably different from America's past.

as mine). There's no dependancies on libstdc++ other than binary ones.Currently on release dwd2, which I'm using on my home rawhide box.
(Obviously not production, since the old apt works fine on production
boxes).Now... Does anyone know of a good way to delete ""old"" RPMS from a
directory containing both ""new"" and ""old"" RPMS? Say I have
blurb-0.1.0-1.i386.rpm, blurb-0.1.0-2.i386.rpm, and
blurb-0.1.1-1.i386.rpm, and want to remove the blurb-0.1.0-* because of
the presence of blurb-0.1.1-1? Anyone have a convenient script?Dave.

CHRIS TEACHES THE BASICS: If you've got friends or family who want to learn more about their PC, from a guy who makes things nice and easy, check out the VHS release of Computer Basics in the GnomeStore. Chris teams with TechTV cohort, Kate Botello, to lead novices on a journey through their computer. From basic interactions, to installing apps, to using the Internet and e-mail, Chris and Kate have all the basics covered. Help out a friend and  get them a copy today.    
It's official: Gretchen, Sprocket, and I will be moving in a few
weeks. Not too far, though. We'll be going deeper into the city of
San Francisco starting on the first of September. Lori and Norm
were here over the weekend (for a photo shoot); in between sets,
Gretchen invited them to join her hunt. They came upon a house
located in one of the busier parts of town. With only street
parking available, I wasn't too thrilled about investigating the
property. However, my wife seemed optimistic. We kinda knew what
we were looking for in a residence (and its neighborhood), but
also knew we'd have to make certain concessions in the process. We
parked (literally) up the hill and found our way to what would
turn out to be our future home (at least, for the next year or
so). It has lots of usable space - which is a premium here. Plus,
the landlords are extremely dog-friendly. Winner! The pictures and
videos will come, never fear.PC World Picks

Blaze Media ProFirst order of business: get broadband! According to AT&T's Web
site, cable modem service is not available in the area. However,
DSL is an option. So, it looks like I'm going to be purchasing an
external DSL
modem in a few days. Any suggestions?
Yeah, I'm not even sure who I'll select for my provider. They
currently use SBC to get online, so I might just stick with them
for continuity's sake. Verizon has been solid enough for me here,
but I believe our loft complex has a unique infrastructure. If I
could make contact with someone from any capable system, I'd
probably go with them. I should probably get the ball rolling
soon, though - I'd hate to play the waiting game for too long.
I've heard of installation nightmares, so I'll probably be rolling
my own (again). 56k is quaint, but hardly enough pipe to get any
real work done. When you download as much as I do, every bit
counts. Oh, and did I tell you about the bites?
There are plenty of unique restaurants in just about every
direction. Plus, we're right up around the corner from a Peet's
outlet! If you need me, you know where you can find me. I'll
probably also be setting up a Wi-Fi network before too long, too.
My Proxim hardware still works, but I wasn't sure if I needed a
crossover cable to connect it to my router. Furo tells me: ""If the
hub has an uplink port, then a straight cable should work between
the two, as it provides the crossover for you. If both have uplink
and non-uplink ports (workstation attachment ports), then you
would need a crossover cable between like ports. For instance, if
you were connecting a workstation port on one to a workstation
port on another, you'd have to use a crossover. Same for uplink to
uplink."" How's that for home network helpfulness? Oh, if only he'd
do a free Gnometome for
us...See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Chris PirilloÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â

Traces Viewer v1.0 [478k] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://www.surfpilot.net/tracesviewer.html
{Find Web site remnants} Who knows what evils lurk on the hard

every website I visit. With Traces Viewer's easy-to-read
interface, I can see what files come from each site, and also if
the site contained any cookies.  Mmmmmm, cookies... now, how could

Print! v1.6 [319k] W9x/2k/XP US$39
    Unearthed by Rob Mullerhttp://www.robsoftware.com/
{Screen print utility} Time is money, and I endorse any program
that can save me time. Luckily, that is exactly what Print! v1.6
does. Say that I want to share screenshots with my other tech
friends to compare error messages and talk about possible fixes:
every time I take a screen shot, I open up Word, paste the
snapshot, and THEN I can print it. Too many steps, too much of my
time! With Print!, I just hit my ""Print Screen"" key and out comes
my screenshot without involving any other programs. Don't want a
screenshot of your whole desktop? Not a problem, just press Alt +
Print Screen and you'll have a printout of the active window only.
Print! 1.6 goes so far as to put the date and time on your
printout too... perfect for saving those high scores on solitaire!
Other features include scaling, centering, and the ability to
invert images. (So, not only will you save time, you'll also save
on toner. Bonus!)  You may also want to note that Print! saves
your printer configuration without wreaking havoc on the settings
in your other programs. You'll definitely get your money's worth
with this program. Don't believe me? Start by checking out the
evaluation version for yourself!Submit Your Thoughts | Recommend It!

Gretchen is a self-professed pack rat: there are just some things

Â GnomeTIPAny modem that relies on Windows to function is dubbed a
""Winmodem."" Most manufacturers use ""Winmodems"" because they are
cheap and easy to set up on a standard model PC. I don't have any
problem with the manufacturer saving money (because living in a
capitalistic society, I would hope that the savings would trickle
down to ME in one way or another). I do, however, have a problem
with the way ""Winmodems"" function after you add more internal
devices to your PC. ""Winmodems"" rely on Windows to mediate their
serial communication (I/O address, COM port, IRQ, etc.) and as you
can imagine, the more devices Windows has to manage, the higher
the probability of running into a problem. And what if you want to
run Linux instead? Will the ""Winmodem"" function well, if at all,
in an operating system other than Windows? Don't bet on it! If you
want to make sure you don't have any problems after upgrading your
system, you'll want to get yourself a hardware modem. How can you
determine this? Checking a modem's system requirements. If the
modem says it REQUIRES Windows, then keep looking... you've found
yourself a ""Winmodem."" However, if the system requirements for the
modem say that it will work with Linux, then you've found yourself
a hardware modem. Yes, it IS that easy.Recommend It!http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/daily/20020715.html

Lifetimetv.com community member BELFAST BELLE writes:
""My belief is that I started using drugs to fit in and to cope with things that happened to me. My mom died when I was 10. I had to live away from my dad and brothers. Where I grew up I was sexually abused for years, but I didn't dare tell anyone. When I finally went to live with my dad and brothers, I had no self-esteem left. I experienced so much shame, and in my mind it seemed as if everyone knew what happened. Drugs helped me to feel OK and like I was a part of something. When my dad died, I was devastated. It threw me into a full-blown addiction. My drug use landed me in rehab, in debt and in strained relationships with my brothers. Thanks to the help of Narcotics Anonymous, I have been clean since December 28, 1991. I now have great relationships with my siblings. I love them more than they will ever know. I also have a beautiful seven-year-old daughter who has never seen her mother touch drugs. I don't have any desire to use, either -- just the desire to be the best pe
 rson I can be.""Express yourself! Tell us your thoughts on ""The Secret Life of Zoey"" and let us know if addiction has affected your life.

"the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in other countries, where those judgments are harder to get.Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after regular spammers. Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles. So, I can't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track spammers down when it's never really been tried. We can subpoena the records of the business they spammed on behalf of.

Given that our whole business plan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with ""not spam"", I can't understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be unsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the potential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the Habeas warrant mark.Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on your installation. If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove us from the next release. But, you're trying to kill Habeas before it has a chance to show any promise.At the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it encourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those without SA) rather than yours. Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the transmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don't steal any more cars. But only if we're given a chance to succeed. - dan -- Dan Kohn -----Original Message----- From: Daniel Quinlan [mailto:quinlan@pathname.com] Sent: Wednesday, August 28, 2002 16:38 To: Matthew Cline Cc: spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net Subject: Re: [SAtalk] O.T. Habeus -- Why? Matthew Cline writes:> There must be *some* way of tracking a spammer down, since they are > planning on making money from the spam. What a court would consider > evidence of being the spammer is another question.Haha!!!Just a few notes: - It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone in various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a good example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law. - Law suits take time. Between now and conclusion of the first court case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes! - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc. - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information! I don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright. Also, some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example, ""pump and dump"" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly required for the spammer to get their way.Dan ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing real-time communications platform!

"Well, as many have said, it's non-trivial and not smart enough.I did try just cvs'ing over the existing sources, but cvs complained that my 
files were in the way.Then I thought that I'd only need the DRI stuff, that took about 1.5 hours to 
fetch 116M. Unfortunately I still need the XFree86 cvs stuff as well :-( At 
339M that took almost 3 hours.Now I can start building the XFree86 cvs and DRI cvs stuff for testing the 3D 
patches for my GVX1 card. I just hope I don't completely trash my system in 
the process. Think I'll wait until morning to start building, though. I've been building a 
new box from source this week. A 200Mhz PentiumMMX with 96M. It took a full 
day to build XFree86 4.2.0 and 2.5 days each to build qtlibs and kdelibs. 
kdebase took just under 46 hours. I've got lots of grief from the wife for 
the computer running 'round the clock this week. The rest of KDE should build 
in under 20 hour increments.Cheers,	John Gay

"" related - party transactions "" is the heading used by enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships , ljm cayman lp and the larger ljm 2 co - investment lp , which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars . mr . fastow severed his ties with the partnerships in june . ljm was set up in june 1999 for energy - related investments , and ljm 2 in december 1999 for energy - and communication - related investments . the journal reported us $ 35 - million of its third - quarter loss of us $ 638 - million were connected with the limited partnerships curt launer , an analyst at credit suisse first boston , said investors should question enron ' s use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets , "" most notably in telecommunications , "" have declined precipitously .

"" questions were raised last week on wall street after the company announced a write - down of more than $ 1 billion due to failed investments in telecoms and other businesses . the disclosure alarmed investors and sent the already battered shares down 23 pc . yesterday they fell another $ 5 . 30 ( # 3 . 80 ) to $ 20 . 75 in early trading . according to the annual report the "" related party transactions "" , as enron describes them , took place in 1999 and 2000 , resulting in losses of $ 16 m and $ 36 m respectively . mr lay said that auditors approved the deals , but would not give further details of what they were . they are understood to have been hedging transactions against enron shares and other assets made by partnerships called ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment jp . "" we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done , "" added mr lay . the relationship between the investment losses and the sec probe is not clear , though the inquiry seems to focus on the partnerships responsible for the hedging transactions . enron owns teesside power station and wessex water in britain and is the largest trader of natural gas in the us . investors are concerned that the probe and the continued uncertainty about the extent of the problem will harm the company ' s credit rating . an enron spokesman said mr fastow continues to work and is not under any suspicion . the sec inquiry is "" informal "" , says the company . the watchdog contacted enron last wednesday , the day of the results announcement . the sec declined to comment . enron made a loss of $ 638 m in the third quarter , its first in over four years . copyright ? 2000 dow jones financial desk shares of enron plummet 21 % energy : sec requests information from company on series of unusual financial deals tied to executive . nancy rivera brooks times staff writer 10 / 23 / 2001 los angeles times home edition c - 1 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company shares of enron corp . set a 52 - week low monday on word that the securities and exchange commission had asked for information about a complex series of financial transactions between the houston - based energy giant and an investment partnership tied to a company executive . enron , the world ' s largest energy trader , said it had voluntarily provided information on "" certain related - party transactions "" that had been previously disclosed to the sec . "" we welcome this request , "" said kenneth l . lay , enron chairman and chief executive . "" we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest , "" he said . the sec request is the latest in a parade of bad news for enron , which has seen investments sour in telecommunications , retail electricity sales and water . investors have battered the company ' s stock , which once sold for nearly $ 85 a share in the last year , and many have criticized enron ' s stingy meting out of financial information . but several wall street analysts remain upbeat on the stock , noting that the bulk of its businesses continue to thrive despite the growing economic downturn . in august , enron chief executive jeffrey k . skilling , one of the main architects of the company ' s strategy of shedding physical assets in search of trading profit , stunned wall street by resigning . skilling cited personal , family - related reasons , but later he acknowledged that the precipitous plunge in the company ' s stock price contributed to his departure . on monday , enron shares plunged $ 5 . 40 , or nearly 21 % , to close at $ 20 . 65 on the new york stock exchange . enron ' s stock has lost nearly 40 % of its value in the last week since it reported a surprise third - quarter loss of $ 618 million after $ 1 . 01 billion in charges reflecting the costs of recent failed investments . but the charge also included $ 35 million related to what enron described only as the "" early termination during the third quarter of certain structured finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity . "" in a conference call with securities analysts about the earnings , the company mentioned that it had repurchased 55 million shares as part of the dissolution of its participation in the transactions . but investors were stunned when stories last week in the wall street journal detailed that the transactions were with a limited partnership organized by andrew s . fastow , enron ' s chief financial officer , and that enron had whittled $ 1 . 2 billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a $ 1 . 2 - billion note it had received from the partnership . shareholder equity now stands at $ 9 . 5 billion . the limited partnership , called ljm 2 , and fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved enron assets and stock , the journal reported . lay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed . a shareholder lawsuit charging that enron ' s directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in texas state court . many companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes , but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them , analyst say . investors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that enron has guarded financial information , making it difficult to analyze the company ' s complex web of businesses . and many are not confident that all the bad news has been released . analyst m . carol coale , who follows enron and other energy companies for prudential securities in houston , downgraded enron to a "" hold "" from a "" buy "" rating monday out of such frustration . coale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of enron . but bob christensen , energy analyst with first albany corp . , said that despite enron ' s recent difficulties , the bulk of the business remains strong . "" i continue to tell investors that 70 % of this company ' s business is growing at a 26 % rate , and that was in the third quarter when this country had a very sharp economic slowdown going on , "" he said . investors are panicking because of a "" bad news story that doesn ' t reflect reality , "" said jon kyle cartwright , senior energy analyst with the raymond james copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .",Safe Email

"" please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multilevel businesses , we - build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e - mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store , or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do . 1 . order all 5 reports shown on the list below ( you can ' t sell them if you don ' t have them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) . * make sure your return address is on your envelope - in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the five reports . you need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the five reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps "" a "" through ' g "" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works you ' ll also see how it doesn ' t work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you ' ve ordered the . five reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 4 down to report # 5 . d . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . e . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 f . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . g . insert your name and address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! copy and paste method works well , . 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 25 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e - mail is free ! to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much , much more . here are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e - mail let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list , the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is i 0 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that amounts to 10 , 000 each of $ 5 bills for you in cash money ! then think about level five ! that ' s $ 500 , 000 alone ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 + $ 500 , 000 for a total of $ 555 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that and more ! report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e - mailing , and e - mail software . method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet 1 . advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive , and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . let ' s say you decide to start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below : lst level - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . $ 50 2 nd level - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . $ 500 3 rd level - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000 4 th level - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 k ) . . . . . . . $ 50 , 000 5 th level - 10 members from those 10 , 000 ( $ 5 x 100 k ) . . . . . . . $ 500 , 000 this totals - $ 555 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 ' s of participants . think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide same - day service on all orders ! this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can ' t advertise until they receive the report ! available reports * * * order each report by number , and name * * * * always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted * - always send your order via first class mail - make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper ( so that the bill can ' t be seen against light ) on one of those sheets of paper include : ( a ) the number & name of the report you are ordering , ( b ) your e - mail address , and ( c ) your name & postal address ( in case your e - mail provider encounters problems ) . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 "" the insiders guide to advertizing for free on the internet "" order report # 1 from : randy dillard p . o . box 8 osprey , fl 34229 usa report # 2 "" the insiders guide to sending bulk email on the internet "" order report # 2 from : carla brown p . o . box 39093 sarasota , fl 34238 usa report # 3 "" the secrets to multilevel marketing on the internet "" order report # 3 from : glynn schmidt p . o . box 19424 sarasota , fl 34276 usa report # 4 ' how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of multilevel marketing and the internet "" order report # 4 from : christin joy cpo 2398 501 e . college avenue wheaton , il 60187 usa report # 5 "" how to send one million e - mails for free .

"takes time and money: noting the amounts of each correction and basing the refund delivery method on the amount. yesh, it's silly to spend $.37 (+ labor and materials) for a $.02 refund, but maybe the only alternative right now is to create dichotomies that require even more time and labor - or keep the money (see john hall below). your mailed refund is a function of bulk.in jax we're on the verge of firing at&t cable for horrible customer service and over-charging. what will probably happen: if the amount of overage per customer is significant (say $30 or more) the refund will go directly to the customer. If it's less, the combined total amount will go to the city as lump sum settlement.in your case, maybe all the customers could vote on line where they'd like their lump sum to go. of courese, they'd have to be notified by mail first. :-)-----Original Message----- From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com]On Behalf Of John Hall Sent: Monday, October 07, 2002 5:02 PM To: Fork@xent.com Subject: RE: The absurdities of life.

"accents in classroom i received a number of helpful and informative responses from a few colleagues and i am grateful to all of them . below please find a digest of the responses . first of all , barbara partee provided the background information on the case itself , which was playing out practically in her own backyard . on july 7 , 1992 , barbara partee ( partee @ cs . umass . edu ) wrote to me : "" i ' m keeping an eye on the westfield accent uproar because it 's not far from here and there 's something about it in the paper almost every day , including editorials . i ' ll be glad to help keep you updated on news , and i would appreciate receiving any references you find out about to research that shows that the parents have nothing to worry about . ( an article in a local paper today , about reactions , said in the last paragraph "" linguists said that , as long as the teacher is comprehensible , parents concerned about having a good "" model "" in the classroom to help their children become americanized quickly in their speech have little to worry about . "" but no names or references . ) what happened was that early last week a petition signed by 403 residents of westfield , mass . was given to the school board in response to a decision to reassign two bilingual education teachers to positions as normal classroom teachers . the petition urges that no teacher be assigned to first or second grades "" who is not thoroughly proficient in the english language in terms of grammar , syntax , and - most important - the accepted and standardized use of pronunciation . "" the mayor of the city , a greek immigrant with an accent , and a proponent of english - only laws , and chair of the city 's school committee , has been vocally in favor of the petition . it has been denounced by the state 's secretary of education , piedad robertson , a native of cuba and a former kindergarten teacher herself , who immediately came out with the statement that the proposal "" would appear to be discrimination , plain and simple . . . . this petition , instead of fostering the acceptance of cultural diversity , would appear to encourage bigotry , racism , and discrimination . "" the mayor in a phone interview june 30 dismissed her attack as "" bovine scatology . "" the state 's attorney general has offered th opinion that the plan would almost certainly violate the state 's anti-discrimination laws . an article today ( both articles i ' m quoting from are in the daily hampshire gazette , of northampton , though there was also a mention in sunday 's nytimes ) says the mayor , george varelas , says he has been getting calls from all over the country , mostly agreeing with his point of view . the two parents who started the drive are expressing great surprise ; the wife , "" who is of spanish and portuguese descent , has become so distraught over accusations of bigotry . . . that she has taken to avoiding people . "" the city has about 36000 population and a broad ethnic mix . but like most of what one reads about the english only movement , there 's a great deal of debate about whether it 's racist or xenophobic , etc . , and very little about the fundamental question that you raised , namely does it in fact have any effect on the acquisition of english by the children in the classes ? "" throughout last week , i was forwarding the responses to barbara and she was updating the story as things evolved . on july the 8th , she was contacted by a reporter of the westfield paper , and she asked me for ( and , of course , received ) permission to use the materials i had in her interview with the paper . on july the 9th , barbara wrote : "" by the way , i heard second hand that the school committee or a subcommittee thereof just voted this morning 3 - 0 not to adopt the petitioners ' request . i ' ll know more by this evening 's news . i expect the newspaper article that our stuff went to will appear tomorrow morning . i ' ll let you know . this is happening quicker , and coming out more emphatically on the right side , than i had expected . "" the article appeared on friday , july the 10th , and barbara is likely to post it here on monday . as you will see , the reporter was absolutely fascinated by the fact of the ongoing worldwide discussion of the issue on a computer net . the same issue of the same paper ran a syndicated column by william raspberry on the subject . i have not yet found a paper available here that runs bill raspberry . that was the chronicle , and now for the substance of the responses . a couple of people suggested that the petitioners ' concern was about the teachers being comprehensible to the grade school students . this is , of course , a most legitimate concern , and many states , school corporations , and universities have taken measures to protect their students from incompetent english speakers . apparently , however , this was not the petitioners ' concern , and the core of the issue was their belief that the students would acquire the foreign accent of a teacher . all the responses on this subject shared the conviction that it could not happen . michael covington ( mcovingt @ uga . cc . uga . edu ) : "" my own rather limited experience is that children are n't even influenced by the foreign accents of their _ parents _ , much less teachers . "" cliff miller ( miller @ defun . cs . utah . edu ) : "" of course it is possible [ for a grade school student to be influenced by the teacher 's foreign accent ] , but it is highly unlikely that it will be complete or long-lasting . and perhaps the more important question is : does it matter ? i grew up in several different places and my english has undergone a number of shifts - - i even had a japanese accent for a while . my english is quite native now and i do n't think that the different stages it went through did it any harm . . . . "" craig thiersch ( thiersch @ kub . nl ) : "" i ' m afraid i do n't have any citations from linguistics literature , and our phonologist is n't here today , but you ' re right : it 's more or less common knowledge that children virtually always acquire the accent of their peers , not that of parents , teachers , or other adults . i can think of countless examples from my own experience : for instance , i used to live in boston , where you can cut the local accent with a knife , and played organ for a church in arlington , mass . , where the pastor and his wife were from the mid - west . but all their children had strong "" towny "" arlington accents . "" amy sheldon ( asheldon @ vx . acs . umn . edu ) : "" i was interested in learning that your daughter never acquired the pronunciations of the 3 adults at home , when they differed from , i assume , the local dialect . i can add that our 9 & 12 year olds do not have any of their father 's quebec french pronunciations or translations in their speech and on occasions when they have had his speech forms / usage , they seem to get rid of it when they learn the local dialect . that is , his speech does not persist in theirs . they also recently asked me if i thought that daddy had a foreign accent . they said they did n't think so . i must admit , that i have to stop and think a second before i realize that he does indeed have an accent , and that on reflection , our kids will admit to it too . but there is a sense in which we do n't think on a minute to minute basis of him as speaking differently from us , though certain pronunciations or translations on occasion may strike us noticeably . i 'd imagine that students in a class with a nonnative teacher muight have the same perceptions , esp . if the teacher is fluent in english , although having an accent . this is a good "" applied linguistics "" example . "" the only references that the discussion has yielded so far were contributed by catherine doughty and susan ervin - tripp . catherine doughty ( catherine . doughty @ linguistics . su . edu . au ) : "" the ability "" to be affected by phonology "" seems to be the earliest of thing to go in terms of maturational constraints on language acquisition - - see the work of johnson & newport 1989 in cognitive psychology 21 . j & n set the age of the beginning of the decline at 5 or 6 . another interesting case that is analogous in some ways but not others is the case of simon a profoundly deaf child of profoundly deaf parents . simon 's parents were late acquirers of asl ( learned at ages 16 & 15 ) and so provided non-native and very different versions of asl to their child . they are his only source of input , as simon goes to a "" normal "" school where no one knows any asl . simon 's asl is comparable to the asl of children who learn asl from native signers - - e . g . , nativelike . ( singleton 1989 dissertation ) . susan ervin - tripp ( ervin-tr @ cogsci . berkeley . edu ) : "" it would be nearly impossible for a child to be influenced by the accent of a grade school teacher unless it was the prestige accent of the community , and the child knew it . as labov showed convincingly , kids get their accents from their peers . on the other hand , i ran into some reported cases of children who preserved the accents of their immigrant parents , but these were unusual cases of socially isolated children . for example , in the clinical literature i found a case of an 8 year old who immigrated at 3 , and still had "" his father 's accent "" . as he was psychoanalyzed ( ! ) he lost his accent , spoke like his peers , and became able to mimic the accent at will . buxbaum , psychoanalytic quarterly , 18 , 279-289 ( 1949 ) .

What does that exactly have to do with the statement that
distruption of peacable political assembly has become
a common practice disruption tool?  It's an observation
not a judgement, comment, approval.  You've focused on the
word ""muddy"" to use it in a different context than the one
I posted.Maybe the distinction I was trying to make was too subtle and
I was trying to be too clever with my writing this morning.
Let me summarize the important parts of my post for you: I
have a premise that there is a difference between free and protected
speech and action.  I think O'Neill on his soapbox doesn't
understand the distinction.All better?  Greg

( 1 ) ( a : * ; b : ok ; c : ? ) ( context : my employer is so puritanical that he would fire me if i behaved in what he considered a libertine manner . ) "" even if "" my wife smoked cigarettes , he would fire me , but , since she would n't ever smoke , he won't fire me . comment of a : the ' even if ' clause is ok with with "" he . . . me "" , but the second halfdoesn ' t match . no one would ever phrase this combination of ideas this way . it has a split focus . is the topic the extent of the employer 's puritanism ( first half ) , or the likelihood / unlikelihood of the speaker 's being fired ( second half ) . i find even my japanese colleagues do this split focus thing all the time . such sentences are extremely difficult and often impossible to parse in any natural way . it took several years of familiarity with japanese versions of english for me even to identify what is going on in sentences like this . i 'd love to know an effective way to explain to japanese students of english why this won't work and maybe more important , how to recognize that they ' ve pro9duced an illicit split focus construction . ( 2 ) ( a : ? ? ? ; b : ok ; c : ? ) "" even if "" you drink just a little , your boss will fire you , but , since you sruely won't drink at all , he won't fire you . comment of a : a ) "" "" even if . . . will fire you "" is most easily interpreted as habitual , while "" you surely * won't * drink at all "" would designate a single event in the future . these sit uneasily together . b ) since drinking a lot is antithetical to drinking a little , the last clause must imply that the boss is thinking of firing the addressee for some other reason . in this case , interpeting the first half according to a ) above , there can be no connection between the firing and the drinking and the sentence fails by virtue of non-entailment . on the other hand , if one * goes back * and reinterprets the ' you ' in the first half merely as the addressee , then the sentence might be possible , given that condition b ) abvove represents the real state of affairs . it would also be implied that the boss needs just a little bit more reason to actualy execute the firing . the final clause would sound better with "" can't "" than with "" won't "" , however , in this scenario . ( 3 ) ( a : * * ; b : * ; c : * ) "" even if "" you drink just a little , your boss will fire you , but since you surely drink a lot , he won't fire you . comment of a : the action posited by the "" even if "" clause is already a maximum limit . the sentence is logically impossible . comment of b : but if you continue the sentence as below then it is fine by me . ( 3 ) ( ok ) "" even if "" you drink just a little , your boss will fire you , but since you surely drink a lot , he won't fire you , you ' ll get fed up and quit before he gets a chance . ( 4 ) ( a : ok ; b : ok ; c : ? ) if it doesn ' rain , the game will continue . "" even if "" it rains lightly , the game will continue ; but if it rains heavily , the rain will be cancelled . i ' m sorry i ' ve made a mistake here . the final clause should be , the game will be cancelled , as roecklein ( a ) pointed out . ( 5 ) ( a : * * ; b : * ; c : * ) if it does n't rain , the game will continue . "" even if "" it rains lightly , the game will be cancelled ; but if it rains heavily , the game will continue . comment of a : nonsense , in order and logic . comment of b : okay if you continue with something like : ( 5 ) ( ok ) if it does n't rain , the game will continue . "" even if "" it rains lightly , the game will be cancelled ; but if it rains heavily , the game will continue , but it will be moved to an indoor arena .

( 7 ) ( a : ok ; b : ok ; c : ? ) "" even if "" my wife smoked cigarettes , i would not scold her , but , if she ever broke my favorite dishes , i would scold her . comment of a : "" scold her "" should nto be repeated at the end . very unnatural .

"" the preferences of conditionals in even if clause over the indicative present are the same to all three people . however , i found many examples of the indicative type . this seems a matter of individual preferences . comment of b : ( 8 ) ( ok ) "" even if "" my wife smokes cigarettes at the dinner table , i will not scold her , but , if she breaks my favorite dishes , i will scold her . comment of c : to make sense of many of your contexts , i had to postpose the "" even if "" clause , e . g . , "" i will not scold my wife , even if she smokes cigarettes . "" placing the "" even if "" clause first in the sentence makes it more emphatic . my own summary : ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) are judged logically impossible as i have expected . but i do not understand laura gonnerman 's rephrasing ok sentence of ( 5 ) . ( 6 ) is also judged unnnatural to all the three people though i expected it would be ok . it seems to me the final clause cahnges the situation and focus of the sentence . why not ok ? finally , i must apologize to you all about the use of "" scold "" in the final two sentences . one person reminded me of the bad implication of husband 's scolding his wife . i did n't notice it . in japan , too , a husband who "" scold "" his wife is an arrogant person these days . thank you very much for your help . please make further comments , if any , on this usage . i ' ll be glad to make a reply . hiroaki tanaka associate professor faculty of integrated arts and sciences tokushima university , japan 1 - 1 , minamijousanjioma , tokushima , 770 , japan phone & fax : + 81 886 56 7125 e-mail : hiro-t @ ias . tokushima-u . ac . jp",Safe Email

"" the market is really shrugging off this news , "" said mark donahoe , a managing director at u . s . bancorp piper jaffray . upbeat earnings news from american express , released monday afternoon , seemed to give stocks an additional lift . investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and u . s . military maneuvers in afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results , said steven kroll sr . , managing director at monness , crepsi & hardt . the uncertainty on the global front "" looks like it is going to be a long , drawn - out affair , "" mr . kroll said . "" i think stocks will revert back to being earnings - driven . "" although dismal by ordinary standards , last week ' s flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors , who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations . "" the markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings , "" said mr . donahoe of u . s . bancorp . that resilience might be giving hope to investors this week , he added . still , investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up , mr . kroll argued . third - quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on monday , with big companies such as minnesota mining and manufacturing and u . s . steel posting results that met or topped analysts ' estimates . the dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p . m . edt when index component american express reported earnings that , excluding certain items , beat wall street previously lowered estimates . the financial - services concern posted net income of $ 298 million , or 22 cents a share , down 60 % from $ 737 million , or 54 cents a share , a year earlier . excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the september 11 attacks , american express said it would have earned $ 595 million , or 45 cents a share , for the latest quarter . analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call . shares of american express surged after the quarterly earnings release , closing up 3 . 4 % at $ 30 . 32 . chip stocks helped lead the nasdaq composite higher , with the philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5 . 4 % . the rally seemed to be a continuation of friday ' s gains in the sector , sparked by positive earnings news from kla - tencor . u . s . steel , the nation ' s no . 1 steelmaker , said it swung to a third - quarter loss from a profit a year earlier , hurt by oversupply and a weak economy . but excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another , u . s . steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call . shares of u . s . steel rose 9 . 7 % to $ 14 . 74 . investors also sent 3 m shares nearly 5 % higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by wall street estimates , despite a 21 % decline in net income . and oil producers conoco and usx - marathon group handily beat analysts ' forecasts . but not all the earnings news was cheery . local phone company sbc communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates . shares of sbc , a component of the dow industrials , fell 5 . 1 % to $ 41 . 40 . meanwhile , the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging , some analysts noted . on monday , 3 m guided wall stret ' s earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter , and a top executive at u . s . steel told analysts that the company ' s fourth quarter would be "" difficult . "" companies "" are meeting third quarter expectations , but they are talking down the fourth quarter , "" said mr . kroll of monness crespi & hardt . he said that some of the rise in monday ' s markets might be a carryover from friday ' s buying activity related to the expiration of u . s . stock option and index option contracts , an event known as "" double witching .

"lrec workshop * lrec workshop announcement * adapting lexical and corpus resources to sublanguages and applications a workshop to be held at the first international conference on language resources and evaluation granada , spain , 26 may 1998 the workshop will provide a forum for those researchers involved in the development of methods to integrate corpora and mrds , with the aim of adding adaptive capabilities to existing linguistic resources . organisers : roberto basili ( university of roma "" tor vergata "" ) , roberta catizone ( university of sheffield ) , maria teresa pazienza ( university of roma "" tor vergata "" ) , paola velardi ( university of roma "" la sapienza ) , yorick wilks ( university of sheffield ) workshop scope and aims lexicons , i . e . , those components of a nlp system that contain "" computable "" information about words , cannot be considered as static objects . words may behave very differently in different domains , and there are language phenomena that do not generalize across sublanguages . lexicons are a snapshot of a given stage of development of a language , normally provided without support for adaptation changes , whether caused by language creativity and development or the shift to such a previously unencountered domain . the divergence of corpus usages from lexical norms has been studied computationally at least since the late sixties , but only recently has the availability of large on-line corpora made it possible to establish methods to cope systematically with this problem . an emerging branch of research is now involved in studies and experiments on corpus-driven linguistics , with the aim of complementing and extending earlier work on lexicon acquisition based on machine readable dictionaries ( mrd ) : data are extracted from texts , as embodiments of language in use , so as to capture lexical regularities and to code them into operational forms . the purpose of this workshop will be to provide an updated snapshot of current work in the area , and promote discussion of how to make progress . central topics will be ( though this list is in no way exclusive ) : * corpus-driven tuning of mrds to optimize domain-specific inferences , * terminology and jargon acquisition , * sense extensions , * acquisition of preference or subcategorization information from corpora * taxonomy adaptation , * statistical weighting of senses etc . to domains * use of mrds to provide explanations of linguistic phenomena in corpora * what is the scope of "" lexical tuning "" * the evaluation of lexical tuning as a separate task , or as part of a more generic task industrial panel * * * new * * * * automatic adaptation of lexicons to new domains through the use of application corpora makes nlp applications more adaptable and portable . the program commettee is organizing a joint panel to discuss this ( and other ) issues concerning next generation information extraction systems . the panel intends to bring industrial representatives to confront expectations in ie from their viewpoint and degree of maturity of the offering . the following ( and other ) issues will be discussed : - is there a market for ie ? - what is the demand in domains such as new services for the citizens , telecommunications , management support , etc ? - what are the technical requirements ? is the technology near to the market ? program committee yorick wilks university of sheffield roberta catizone university of sheffield paola velardi university of roma "" la sapienza "" maria teresa pazienza university of roma "" tor vergata "" roberto basili university of roma "" tor vergata "" bran boguraev brandeis university sergei nirenburg new mexico state university james pustejowsky brandeis university ralph grishman new york university christiane fellbaum princeton university paper submission formatting guidelines : papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . hard copies : three hard copies should be sent to : paola velardi dipartimento di scienza dell ' informazione via salaria 113 00198 roma italy electronic submission : electronic submission will be allowed in poscript or word per mac or rtf . an ftp site will be available on demand . authors should send an info email to paola velardi ( velardi @ dsi . uniroma1 . it ) even important dates * * * * * ( please note extended deadline ) * * * * * * paper submission deadline ( hard copy / electronic ) march 10 paper notification april 1 camera - ready papers due april 20 l&ct workshop may 26 prof . paola velardi dipartimento di scienza dell ' informazione via salaria 113 universita ' "" la sapienza "" 00198 roma ph . + 39 - ( 0 ) 6-49918356 fax + 39 - ( 0 ) 6-8541842 8841964",Safe Email

>>Do we have any statistics on the poor man's divorce from centuries past?Eugen Leitl:
>That's easy. Divorce didn't happen.You seem not to know what a ""poor man's divorce"" is.
It is an old term, from the time when divorce was
difficult, but walking was easy, and identity was
not so locked down as it is today. Not every widow
had a dead husband.>I'm seeing lack of innovation ..That doesn't tell us anything except what is
happening in Eugen Leitl's life. The more common
observation is that the rate of change is increasing.
Do you have any data that might persuade us that what
you see is more telling than what others see?>gerontocracy favors gerontocracy.I would have thought that gerontocracy favors biotech
research and plenty of young workers to pay taxes.
Note that the fertility rate doesn't result from
decisions made by the old, but by the young. If we
want more kids, we have to convince people who are
in their twenties to become parents.

"new book : language processes social and cognitive approaches to interpersonal communication edited by susan r . fussell , carnegie mellon university roger j . kreuz , university of memphis historically , the social aspects of language use have been considered the domain of social psychology , while the underlying psycholinguistic mechanisms have been the purview of cognitive psychology . recently , however , it has become increasingly clear that these two dimensions are highly interrelated : cognitive mechanisms underlying speech production and comprehension interact with social psychological factors , such as beliefs about one 's interlocutors and politeness norms , and with the dynamics of the conversation itself , to produce shared meaning . this realization has led to an exciting body of research integrating the social and cognitive dimensions which has greatly increased our understanding of human language use . this volume contains a collection of papers by noted social and cognitive psychologists illustrating this theme . each chapter demonstrates how the theoretical approaches and research methods of social and cognitive psychology can be successfully interwoven to provide insight into one or more fundamental questions about the process of interpersonal communication . the topics under investigation include the nature and role of speaker intentions in the communicative process , the production and comprehension of indirect speech and figurative language , perspective-taking and conversational collaboration , and the relationships between language , cognition , culture , and social interaction . the book will be of interest to all those who study interpersonal language use : social and cognitive psychologists , theoretical and applied linguists , and communication researchers . 0-8058 - 2269 - 0 [ cloth ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 59 . 95 0-8058 - 2270 - 4 [ paper ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 32 . 50 lawrence erlbaum associates , inc . orders @ erlbaum . com",Safe Email

********************************""Personal Choice"" Primo Exotic Supplemental Smoking Botanical / Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" Variety / Supplemental Agenda ""Seventh Heaven"" Paradoxical Configuration for the ""significant"" Enhancement and Pleasuring of body, mind & spirit ""sensitivities"" -- Potentiated; Gnarly, whole-plant Matrix  -- Paragonic Reserve; Enigmatic Blendage Mood ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoking / Brewing Herba.Actions & indications: Simultaneous, High-Spirited; ""Stimulation / Relaxation / Aphrodisia"" (Significant Paradise Consequence!)This is the Personal Choice, Sensitive, Responsive Smoking (""Smoka"") product we have wanting to offer! This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater ""Sensitivity / Responsiveness"" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature ""smokables"" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This ""Shangrila"" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!
 must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves ""potent significance"" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after ""flowering"" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all ""viripotent,"" which makes this ""gnarly stoke"" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve ""viripotency"" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!
g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.Suffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, ""sensitive/responsive"", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (""Smoka"") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!* Mill-stoned & honed.
* Depressive regressive!
* Psychologically uplifting!
* Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!
* Sophisticated, well-balanced ""ambiance.""

* Easy on, easy off!
* SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!
* No ""munchie"" factor.
* No failed drug tests!Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent ""Smoka"", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat!Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned & Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only).

**PROSAKA (tm)**
******************High-Ratio extracts in tablet form for Calm, Balance, Serenity & Peaceful living.This Prosaka formulation, which we have just recently further potentiated, boasts an extremely loyal and abundant patronage, having been available to market at large now for a number of years. Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing.

"Thank you for your interest!Judgment Coursesoffers an extensive training
course in ""How to Collect MoneyJudgments""If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income .If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.""The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoney
Judgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5more
Judgments take its place.We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.The income potential is substantial in this profession. We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time .One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)Quote's from several of our students:Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .Your
professionalism in both the manual and your support.  
You have the video opened doors for me in the future. 
There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states 
he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on""After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us: ""I am now making $2,000.00 per
week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now""After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
""I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help out""Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months"">From the above information and actual results you can see

Copies, Webcasts tangled in draft bill Legislators are readying a bill that could sharply limit Americans' rights relating to copying music, taping TV shows, and transferring files through the Internet.
At the same time, the draft legislation seen by CNET News.com would place the struggling Webcasting industry on firmer legal footing.

 | Read Full Story Sharp's Zaurus PDA suffers security holesSharp's Linux-based, business-oriented Zaurus handheld suffers from security holes that could let hackers grab private data off a corporate network, according to researchers at Syracuse University.
In an advisory posted Wednesday to a Syracuse University computer-science Web site, researchers said they had found vulnerabilities in Sharp's Zaurus SL-5500 and Zaurus SL-5000D handhelds. The flaws let attackers take control of the device's file system, giving them the power to overwrite files or lock the device so no data can be input through the keypad or touch screen.

 | Read Full Story Outlook plug-in could let the hackers inA widely used plug-in for Microsoft's Outlook e-mail client that lets users encrypt and digitally sign messages has inadvertently weakened security and left the mail program open to attack.
Security company eEye Digital Security issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associates' Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerability in the add-on could let attackers execute malicious software on a victim's computer. Network Associates released a patch for the problem Wednesday as well.

ACLU: Don't rat out your customersA clutch of civil liberties groups is asking small Internet service providers to get a backbone and stand up to companies seeking to unveil anonymous critics.
A group including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the Center for Democracy and Technology is urging ISPs to alert customers when they are the targets of so-called John Doe legal actions, which try to unmask the identities of people who anonymously air their companies' dirty laundry. The group has sent letters to more than 100 ISPs, asking them to adopt a written policy promising to let customers know if they're targets.

The lawsuits, each filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this week on behalf of PayPal shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies' fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price eBay is paying for PayPal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory filings on Thursday.

Internet Success Through Simplicity
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Every day of the week, I get questions from people all  
 over the world, including my No BS GIMG Members,  
 wanting to know some of the most valuable ""secrets"" 
 to my on-going internet success.
 
Let me say, above all else, I don't believe there are any 
 *true* ""secrets"" to success on the Net. What you do to 
 become successful in the online world is not a ""secret"", 
 in my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear, 
 repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the 
 Net or off.
 
But, when it comes to someone asking for advice, 
 consultation, or simply asking, ""What's your secret?"", 
 I have to blush & say ...
 
Persistence and personality.
 
Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little 
 disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the 
 same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over 
 the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in  
 my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.
 
Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable. 
 It's not years of digging to find the ""secrets"" to internet riches.
 
One thing that ""gets to me"" so often in my work as an 
 Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success 
 Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to 
 have this incredibly huge mental block that stands 
 between themselves and success on the Net. It's 
 almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims 
 of what works and what doesn't work, and so many 
 LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in 
 their online venture, that ""success"" is the  equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall.
 
It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!!
 
Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau 
 has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking 
the Bank. Get it!! 
 http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb . 
 But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks 
 so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your 
 online venture a success. 
 
And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of 
 ""self marketing"" - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's 
 the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't 
 agree with him more.
 
Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to 
 succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your 
 marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' 
 experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU! 
 Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying.
 
The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have 
 standing high as you can see, blocking the path 
 between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is 
 not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there 
 to fear to begin with ... get over it!!
 
What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between 
 you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. 
 When you realize this, you will tear down that brick 
 wall by means of complete and instantaneous 
 disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*, 
 which is the only ""real"" place it ever was anyhow!
 
Yes, ""persistence and personality"" inherently includes 
 honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other 
 qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate 
 goals and realize that probably the most valuable,  
 powerful key to your success ... is YOU!
 
That may be the most incredible ""secret"" we ever 
 uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall 
 won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.
 
Talk about SIMPLE!!

Our web site is initially designed to get leads, build 
branding, and provide information.......with a 12 month goal 
of selling our service more specifically via a shopping cart. 
We offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments 
via our site.
Our site has been up less than 2 months and our expectation 
was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in 
traditional media and by referral for more information, and 
to make a professional impression on someone you may not 
meet before providing service.
The growth of our customer base shopping on line has grown 
outside of anyone's expectations.......certainly mine and 
I've been in this business for 25 years. The Internet is not 
dead in the horse business, it is just getting it's legs, and 
the folks using it want to get all the ancillary services 
on-line as well. Our site (the first we've developed) has 
exceeded our expectations, and we aren't satisfied with it 
yet.......we just wanted to get it there for information!

Branding. While quality customer service and product 
have been and will always be our top priority brand building 
Zesto is our most challenging task.
Zesto.com ranks very high and most often #1 or 2 on 
all major search engines and directories even Yahoo entering 
the keyword zesto. The problem is simply that,who if anyone 
would type the keyword zesto, therefore we must try to 
build our brand by ensuring that generic keywords associated with our products (citrus peel) are used throughout 
our site as well as search engine submissions.
Fortunately owning a non generic domain short, easy 
to remember and trademarked works in our favor because 
the marketability potential is limitless.

"petrochem desk i had a chance to speak with christian lebroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals . as it turns out , christian left rac in april and joined the petrochem desk as a trader . previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or swags . unfortunately , the group had a rough p & l year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof . when asked about the fundamentals group , christian indicated that they ' d only been around about 3 - 4 months and are not yet well - suited to curve building . john nowlan is indeed the head of the group . from a timing perspective , i told christian that it would probably take at least 6 - 8 weeks to develop a curve , especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers / fundamentals . as was suggested yesterday during our meeting , a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a nymex component ( e . g . , crude oil ) would provide a great beginning point - - we could then potentially strengthen / augment this relationship with other key factors ( e . g . , supply and demand terms ) borne out of our market research . nelson",Safe Email

5-gram'ing of long words with high-bit characters is likely overly expensive
*when* it happens, but it doesn't happen that often, and as an approach to
non-English languages it sucks anyway (i.e., there's no point speeding
something that ought to be replaced entirely).",Safe Email

Date: 2002-09-25T00:38:31-05:00_Anil Dash_: XML version 1.0[1]. â€œWhy isn't there a way to syndicate my 
words without butchering the way they look?â€ Several people protested 
last week by changing their weblog templates to something like this[2]. Jason 
Levine has more links[3] to those involved. I spoke with one of the people who 
implemented it, and she claims it wasn't a protest as such, more of an inside 
joke. Point taken: the entire point of an aggregator (and syndication in 
general) is to make everyone's words look the same. Counterpoint: the default 
in most weblog systems is to only publish excerpts in RSS feeds; nobody's 
forcing you to publish full posts. This would probably be a good place to 
insert a Zen quote about attachment, but my mind is too fuzzy to find it. _Timothy Appnel_: More FFKAR, RDF, and FOAF[4]. FFKAR is â€œthe format 
formerly known as RSSâ€. Sam has already implemented it[5]. _Nicholas Avenell_: ESF[6]. â€œAre you also fed up with the continuing war 
between RSS 0.9* and 1.0 and 2.0 and whatever else they invent today? Me too. 
So today I invented the Epistula Syndication Format. ESF. It isn't XML. It 
isn't RDF. It's just data.â€ Sam[7] would love it, then. But Movable Type 
doesn't support outputting dates in Unix timestamp format[8], which could be an 
impediment to mainstream acceptance. _Shelley Powers_: Consumer Rights and RSS[9]. â€œI'm not buying into RSS 
0.9x. I'm not buying into RSS 2.0. I'm not buying into RSS 1.0. I changed my 
RSS 0.91 and RSS 1.0 templates to read the following:â€     *RSS not supported here*     This weblog does not support RSS 0.9x, RSS 2.0, or RSS 1.0. If you wish to

Speech at TTI Vanguard: ""Designing for Resiliency"" 
Conference""911.net""by Bruce Sterling     Late last month I had the joy and privilege
of hanging out with a big crowd of American computer
scientists who were, basically, trying to find some 
reasons to live.    Despite all evidence to the contrary, they've
definitely got some reasons.    When you go to a conference which is very high-energy, 
with a lot of paradigmatic reassessment going on, where 
ideas are being flung around bodily well outside the box, 
well, that's an impressive thing.  But it's my principle 
as a sometime working journalist  not to get all carried 
away whenever I witness something like that.  They might 
well be drinking their own bathwater.  This sort of thing 
generally requires a reality check from some *other* 
conference.    So, I'm now fresh back from Colorado, from the yearly 
meeting of the High Ground Design Conversation.  These are 
my best pals in the industrial design world, some dear, 
long-time friends of mine, whose judgment I always trust.  
And why would a science fiction writer trust the judgment 
of industrial designers?  Well, because they're very 
*trendy.*  They're very shrewd,  and very stylish, and very 
hands-on people.  They're  peculiarly self-effacing and modest,
yet quite  imaginative.  Better yet, they're even practical.  
So they're kind of like science fiction writers, only with 
much better shoes.    Usually when I go to this High Ground event, I just 
deliver some wacko chat about popular aspects of 
cyberculture and then I take some worshipful notes.  But!  
I have to report that when I took them my notes from the 
""CRA Grand Challenges in Computation"" conference, I was 
bringing the noise.    This is the first time I have ever seen their jaws 
drop.  They're still kinda wringing their hands over the 
dotcom boom and the Ka-boom. They miss those glory days of 
the World Wide Web == because for them, that was the 
Graphic Designers Full Employment Act.  So they're pretty 
broke, and they're a little shell-shocked, so I guess they 
should join the club.  But  when I brought them *this* 
stuff == a rather extensively worked-out vision in 
worldbuilding from the point of view of ubiquitous 
computation in the 21st century...  Well, of course this 
is merely a scenario, but to me, ""911.net"" smells like the 
future.     And frankly, it doesn't smell good.  But that's all 
right.  Because these aren't good times.  These are rather 
harsh, dark times, and in its own peculiar way, 911.net is 
a similarly harsh, dark concept.    ""Ubiquitous computation"" is by no means a new idea.   
The guy who invented the term is dead, and even his R&D 
lab doesn't look all that great these days.  Ubicomp has 
been around for quite some time == in the table-napkin, 
handwaving stage.  But it's lacked the means, motive and 
opportunity to get any real-world traction.   I believe that may be changing.  If so, it's mostly due 
to the events of September 11.  After that experience, 
ubicomp has got motive and opportunity as it never had 
before.  And the means, although they are still 
speculative, are starting to make some sense.    What am I talking about when I use the term ""ubicomp""?  
Well, the term is a grab-bag, a congelation of different 
technologies.  Some are here, commercially available off 
the shelf; some are in the lab; and some may be physically 
impossible.    Let's get down to some brass virtual tacks.  What are 
the key technical drivers for widely distributed, self-
organizing networks of sensors, processors and actuators, 
embedded in the physical world?  And what do you do with 
these things?    Okay, number one:  fuel cells.  Not chemical 
batteries.  Small, portable, dependable, long-lasting, 
power sources with some punch.  They may not be fuel cells 
as they are now known.  They might be MEMS fuel cells, or 
aluminum-air cells, or something enzymatic, I don't care; 
just something much, much better than today's batteries.  
Portable power is the crux.  Ubicomp's  future, if it has one,
entirely hinges on this.  If we don't get some seriously 
advanced,  portable sources of power then everything I am 
about to tell you is a sci-fi phantasm. (Not that there's 
anything wrong with that!)    Number two, RFID.  Radio-Frequency ID == gotta have 
some taggers.  Gotta be on the Net.  It'd be nice if they 
had some powered processors in them.  Something internal, 
pervasive, a little computational action that is going on 
inside physical objects.    Number three, wireless broadband.  Getting real close 
here.   Number four, dongles.  I think this part is seriously 
underappreciated.  This is the weird part of ubicomp, the 
part that may turn out to be its Achilles heel:  some way 
to turn the damn thing off.  And to *know* it's off.  The 
problem of the authorized user.  The authorized 
administrator, the authorized access.  This is likely to 
play out as ubicomp's functional equivalent of the 
Internet's intellectual-property problem.  In other words, 
it's a very serious issue which is going to be neglected 
from the get-go, as people are eagerly building the basic 
infrastructure.  Then, as they lamely try to build it in 
later, they are going to find out that they have 
inadvertently poisoned the water-stream for everybody.    You don't want to wander into a Kazaa and Napster 
version of George Orwell.  Ubiquitous computation, unlike 
information, does not ""want to be free.""  This is not a 
technology of freedom. Ubiquitous computation wants to 
make you its slave. Try to remember that, for all our 
sakes, all right?  This is not a water-cooler for gossip, 
like the Internet is.  This is a hard-case, hard-times, 
hands-on, rather ruthless command-and-control system.    Number five, GPS, global positioning systems.  Been 
there, done that.    Number six, convoy traffic.  I think this is also 
underestimated, for when I started looking at serious 
applications for ubicomp, time and again, rapidly shipping 
large amounts of physical material in and out of the 
ubicomp zone is a killer application.  Getting stuff in, 
numbering it, assembling it, moving it out. Lots of it. 
Train loads, truck loads, bus loads. And airlifts.    Bringing up the van, a whole bunch of other ubi-stuff, 
of varying degrees of use and practicality.  High speed 
fiber optic networks, check.  Massive storage and routers, 
check.  Big databases, check, but they need to be fast and 
flexible. Some ""MobiHoc"" action: mobile ad-hoc self-
assembling networks: networks that are always 
reconfiguring in real-time, always on the move.      Facial recognition has a considerable number of 
ubicomp applications, by no means all of them good.  Human 
presence-sensing systems?  Oh yes.  Ruggedized hardware 
suitable for outdoor deployment in all conditions and 
weathers.  Real-time simulation of ongoing major 
situations.  Toxin detectors of various kinds, 
environmental monitoring of almost every sort, biometric 
ID...  I have a long list of these.  I'm cross-checking 
them.  I'm using them to build scenarios.    One thing about 911.net makes it very distinct from 
earlier visions of ubicomp.  This is not Microsoft Windows 
for Housekeeping.  This is a hard, tough web that you 
throw down fast over dire emergencies.  The key concept 
here is that we are finally moving computation out of the 
ivory tower, for good and all.  No more glass boxes of the 
1950s, no more clean abstractions of cyberspace.  We are 
deploying computation at unheard-of speed, into the 
darkest, dirtiest, most dangerous places in the world.    It is a resilient security apparatus for emergencies. 
That is 911.net.      Now, you might well argue that ubicomp is very 
invasive of privacy.  That's just what my industrial 
design pals said about it, immediately, and they were 
right.  It's been hard to find reasonable deployments for 
ubicomp in peacetime commerce and in private homes, 
because it is so Orwellian. However.  Under certain 
circumstances, other social circumstances do trump this 
issue.    For instance, when you are breathing your last under a 
pile of earthquake rubble, you don't really care much 
about privacy under your circumstances.  What you really 
want is  a smart bulldozer, a tourniquet, and some direct 
pressure against your open wounds.  And that is what 
911.net is about == or will be about, should it find its 
way out of the computer-science talking-shop and into 
daylight.       It is an emergency response system for the planet's 
open wounds.  And those wounds exist in plenty.  There are 
more of them all the time.    I rather doubt that the Orwellian version of ubicomp 
has much of a future.  That's a scenario that I have 
dubbed ""Terrorspace"", which is ubicomp in the context of 
airports and nuclear power sites.  If you've been in 
airports recently, I believe you are seeing a pretty apt, 
early version of Terrorspace.  At any random moment, you 
can have your possessions rifled through by strangers.  
Your shoes are scanned, and various small but vital 
objects in your pockets can be confiscated by semi-
educated security geeks.  They're either pathetically 
under-trained for the job (in which case you certainly 
feel no safer), or else they are intelligent and capable 
people (in which case you pity them and wish they had some 
other job, for the sake of general human happiness and the 
GNP).  Rather than making us any safer, Terrorspace 
airports serve as political indoctrination centers that 
humiliate our voting population on a broad scale. They are 
meant to inure us to ever-escalating levels of 
governmental clumsiness and general harm.    The difficulty with this Terrorspace approach is that 
airports and airlines are going broke.  Airports are 
hemorrhaging money trying to maintain this terrorspace 
apparatus.  It is likely to spread to the brittle power of 
nuclear power plants, nuclear waste dumps, bio-sites, 
chemical sites, liquid petroleum gas centers and so forth. 
That will hugely increase the overhead of all these 
dangerous industries.     That's a very considerable tax burden.  So, though 
Terrorspace may serve as a full employment program for the 
loyal and slightly stupid, that's not going to pay off 
socially or economically in the long run.   However, 911.net is a different matter.   An air-
deployable 911.net that allowed first responders to 
rapidly deal with fires, floods and other major disasters 
would *save* money, especially for the insurers, who are 
already on the ropes.    The actual September 11 event, 9/11, was a rare and 
remarkable thing.  And, with fewer than 3,000 people dead, 
it's just not that big a deal as genuine catastrophes go.  
Politically, theologically and militarily it was huge, but 
a workaday 911.net wouldn't fret much about terrorism.  
Instead, it would have to deal mostly with floods, fires, 
climate change, earthquakes, volcanoes and (let's hope 
never) asteroids and weapons of mass destruction.   So, basically, with 911.net, we are describing a social 
re-definition of computer geeks as firemen.  Native 
twenty-first century computer geeks as muscular, with-it, 
first-responder types.  I think this would be pretty good 
for the computer industry.  We all need to take the 
dysfunctional physical world far more seriously.  This 
week, Italy's flooding, Texas is flooding, Colorado's on 
fire.  This morning, the brand-new wilderness forests 
around the site of the former Chernobyl are on fire, 
spewing radioactive ash hither and yon.   Chunks of 
Antarctica the size of Rhode Island have fallen into the 
sea. I could go on.    This is the sort of activity that humanity is required 
to deal with in this new century. If we build a successful 
method with which to do this, those useful tactics will 
spread across the fabric of our civilization.  I believe 
they are already spreading.  An innovation like 911.net 
will likely serve as a camel's nose in the tent for a 
whole series of ubicomp applications across society.    I've been speculating about these new forms of 
ubicomp, and giving them some flashy neologisms, because 
that is what science fiction writers bring to the table.  
We build little scenario worlds and make up names for 
them.  First we've got ""911.net,"" then ""Terrorspace,"" but 
there are others.BATTLESPACE.  A term already much-used by the Pentagon.  
Battlespace means military C4ISR. The ""Revolution in 
Military Affairs.""  I would point out that the military, 
unlike some sectors, is not reneging on their enthusiastic 
commitment to the digital revolution.  On the contrary.  I 
haven't seen anybody in the military saying that they long 
to go back to the good-old-fashioned, solid, easy-to-
understand methods of the War in Vietnam.  The military 
are very into ""network-centric warfare,"" and they couldn't 
be happier about their spysats and surveillance drones.PROSTHETIC UBICOMP.  This is eldercare.  A huge, steadily 
growing market. Alzheimer's disease is a flat-out domestic 
catastrophe that lasts seven years.  Any computational 
help here == in elder-proofing spaces, tracking the sick 
and so forth == would be of huge benefit to society.CRADLE.NET.  Babies have no privacy.  Children have little 
privacy. Child-proofing a room against a crawling tot... 
if you've ever done this, you can realize how much use it 
might be to have this process automated.  Any two-year-old 
always wonders:  ""Why can't Mr Fork and Miss Wall Socket 
be friends?""  A real-time checklist, at the very least!  
And then we're faced with the interesting, large-scale 
prospects of ""K-12.net.""STREET.NET.  This would be traffic management and urban 
systems management.  Water networks, power networks,
subways, sidewalks and so forth.PUNISH.NET.  Two million people are in the American prison 
population.  They've got no privacy.  They've gotta be 
watched all the time.  They're basically crammed in iron 
cages now.INDUSTRIAL UBICOMP. Managing supply chains, industrial 
assembly and so forth.  This will eventually be the 
biggest application.SO/HO UBICOMP.  Ubicomp in the home, the home office and 
small office.  Some very interesting consumer uses here, 
but in the grand scheme of things, not that big a deal.SAFETYSPACE.  These would be military bases, U.N. safety 
zones, refugee camps, and disaster evacuation centers.  
It's fairly easy to imagine ubiquitous computation as a 
sinister ""gated community"" that walls off privileged areas 
under threat.  But we can also think of it as importing 
some human comfort, solidarity, mercy and safety into 
various benighted areas that are severely disturbed.  One 
can imagine a Gorazde UN safe zone version of this, new 
and improved of course: a black helicopter ghosts over in 
the dead of night, deploys a scattering of small drones, 
smart-mines and sensors, and suddenly the war just stops 
within these bounds of Safetyspace.  Rapine, looting, 
sacking, smashing and burning are  ruled out of existence 
through computer awareness.  The handiness of a technique 
like that for life in the 21st century... well, it might 
be a bit underestimated.And last, coming up with a bullet should the good times 
return in all their carefree glory:  UBITOPIA.  This I 
take to be ubicomp as an Urban Entertainment Destination.  
You go there for fun just because there is cool, wacky 
stuff embedded in the physical world, and it's behaving in 
a way that brings joy and hilarity and good spirits, like 
the funhouse mirror at a digital carnival.      When and if Ubitopia really hits, it will mean that 
humanity's basic relationship with our material goods has 
been radically redefined.  That is the apotheosis of 
ubiquitous computation. Just: material goods, and the way 
we deal with them, are different.  Different in character, 
different in quality.  Not recognizable by 20th century 
standards.     So. I have no idea if the Homeland Security 
department, or FEMA or DARPA or the NSF, are going to pony 
up any money for any of these notions.  That's not my 
lookout.  I'm a science fiction writer.  And ladies and 
gentlemen, with this material, I have struck platinum.  
This stuff is really hot.  This is a great, attractive, 
contemporary idea that is really new, really different, 
and really ominous.  The implications are huge and they 
spread across the board of society. I am going to be a 
very busy guy with this material.  If you want to help me,

"re : sum : native speaker intuitions marilyn silva recently summarised responses dealing with "" native speaker intuitions "" , especially with respect to the sentence ' john asked mary to leave ' . she notes that several respondents pointed out that the interpretation of this sentence is determined , at least in part , pragmatically , and the view that the interpretation is syntactically fixed is wrong . this point is demonstrated by the ) pair of examples : ) ) [ 1 ] the teacher asked the child to leave the room . ) [ 2 ] the child asked the teacher to leave the room . i am a native speaker of english ( new zealand english ) , and i am not a syntactician , so i do n't think my syntax is being moulded by my , or anyone else 's , rules or theories , but , in both [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] , i can only interpret the person being asked ( the child in [ 1 ] , the teacher in [ 2 ] ) as being the person required to leave the room . no amount of ) intuition fatigue ( which could be summed ) up as "" say a weird string 50 times and it sounds good ; say a ) good string 50 times and it sounds weird "" ) has been able to change my interpretation of this kind of sentence . perhaps for some people the interpretation of this sentence * is * syntactically determined . the summary concludes with : ) in his post to me , carson contends that judgment data "" can ) provide real , useful data , if we would just be more systematical ) and careful about how we collect them . of course speakers will ) differ on certain points . . . . the interesting question is whether ) the range of variation we find is systematically constrained in ) ways that interesting theories of grammar can explain . "" i agree that ( native ) speakers will differ on certain points - - my syntax probably differs from that of most people , and i think this is probably typical ( in my case the following ( a ) sentences are ungrammatical and would normally be the ( b ) sentences : 1 . ( a ) i promised mary to leave . ( b ) i promised mary i would leave . 2 . ( a ) candidates are recommended to obtain the booklet . ( b ) it is recommended that candidates obtain the booklet . 3 . ( a ) john requires to pass the examination . ( b ) john needs to / must pass the examination . john requires a pass in the examination . s . o . requires john to pass the examination . 4 . ( a ) i saw the barn red . ( b ) ? ? ? it is important that syntactitions realise that one there are probably thousands of syntactically distinct englishes out there , and i am not talking about socially or geographically definable varities . there may not be many new zealand english speakers who share the above judgments , but * my * english is no less based on a natural language grammar than anyone else 's . because the interpretation of a certain construction may be influenced by pragmatic factors is some , or even in the majority , of speakers , does not disqualify a purely syntactic account if there are speakers whose language data are accounted for by it . where there is variation among langauge users , it is very important not to conflate these differences and try to base a grammar ( syntax / phonology . . . ) on an impure sample . untimately , a grammar is an account of an individual ' s language . student 's who disagree with data are rarely being contentious - - i contend that they have a slightly different grammatical structure which is , of course , no less valuable in the search for constraints on syntactic structure than the teacher 's or a "" received "" english grammar . i heartily endorse carson 's call for more systematic and careful collection of syntactic data . think about it - - is your english really syntactically the same as your colleague 's , or your father 's ? if not , care must be taken when conflating data from these sources , and even more care must be taken when conflating data from even more diverse sources . wayne p . lawrence",Safe Email

"Forwarded message ---------- From: Vernon Schryver To: dcc@calcite.rhyolite.com Date: Mon, 26 Aug 2002 09:09:05 -0600 (MDT) Subject: Version 1.1.11 of the DCCersion 1.1.11 of the DCC source is in http://www.rhyolite.com/anti-spam/dcc/source/dccd.tar.Z and http://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/source/dccd.tar.Zhttp://www.rhyolite.com/anti-spam/dcc/dcc-tree/CHANGES and http://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/dcc-tree/CHANGES start with fix dccm bugs with handling a non-responsive server. change misc/hackmc to modify sendmail.cf to reject unauthorized relay attempts with a temporary failure when they are supposed to be sent to the DCC but dccm is not running. This prevents leaking relay relay spam. You must use the new hackmc script to install this change in sendmail.cf. remove ""# whitelisted"" from `cdcc stats` output to give more room for totals. prevent empty dccproc log files as noted by Krzysztof Snopek. even fatal errors should cause dccproc to exit with 0 to avoid rejecting mail, as noted by Krzysztof Snopek. When server hostnames have common IP addresses, prefer the server with the non-anonymous client-ID, noted by Krzysztof Snopek.

trucks across the country overnight where they sit, waiting to be sold to 
people. Meanwhile, the exact same content is available _for free_ using an 
insidious peer-to-peer downloading system called ""the Web"" by typing in the 
keyword ""www.nytimes.com"". Those people at the New York Times must not 
understand the Internet or something! More examples: the thriving shareware market, the Baen Free Library, Janis Ian

image compression algorithm which gels more or less with the JPEG
mechanism. Since I don't quite understand how jpeg works (it's hard
math, and I'm just a dumb comp. eng.) I don't know how exactly it
matches up to JPEG. I'm more curious as to whether it covers MPEG,
because it /is/ described in the context of video streams rather than
stills, and I had a vague impression that the MPEG and JPEG
compression techniques were similar. One of the patents it references
also seems to hint at MPEG.Let's all use PNG, eh? *cough* *wheeze*Cheers,

"re : banning of german while flipping through random books at the linguistics library , i fell over something that would be interesting to this discussion . i have n't been following this thread , so this might have been mentioned before . i found a reference to the us supreme court reports , 1922 october term , meyer vs . nebraska , p . 392 - - 403 in steinberg ( 1993 ) an introduction to psycholinguistics , longman . i ' ll quote the passage in full , as it is so well written . it 's in the beginning of chapter 8 . "" in may of 1920 , in hamilton county , nebraska , a rural area of the united states , a teacher , mr robert meyer , was arrested for violating state law . mayer had been teaching bible stories in german at zion parochial school to a 10 - year-old boy . nebraska law forbade the teaching of a second language to children under the age of 13 . not only nebraska but 21 other states as well prohibited the teaching of foreign languages , except 'd ead ' languages such as latin and greek . according to nebraska 's 1919 siman act , ' no person . . . shall teach any subject to any person in any language other than the english language . languages other than english may be taught only after a pupil shall have . . . passed the eighth grade . . . . any person who violates any of the provisions of this act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and , upon conviction , shall be subject to a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars ( $ 25 ) , nor more than one hundred dollars ( $ 100 ) or be confined in the county jail for any period not exceeding thirty days for each offense . ' if found guilty , meyer could have been fined or even sent to jail . the states had passed these laws essentially with the german language as the target , america had just finished a war with germany and there was a hatred of germany and things german , particularly its military values , ideals and political institutions . the law reflected the widespread belief that the german language was the embodiment of all that was evil in german culture and that to teach such a language to young americans would be immoral and corrupting . meyer decided to appeal his case to the supreme court of the state of nebraska . ironically , lawyers for the state of nebraska took essentially the position presented in the german language by the german philosopher , wilhelm von humboldt , in 1836 . that is , a language by its very nature represents the spirit and national character of a people . if this were true , then by teaching them the grammar , structure and vocabulary of the german language , meyer could indeed have been harming american children by making them into german militarists right there on the plains of nebraska . the nebraska supreme court denied meyer 's appeal , but meyer did not submit . he then took his case to the highest court in the country , the united states supreme court , where he won his case . that court overturned his conviction and declared unconstitutional all laws in the united states which forbade the teaching of a foreign language . in its 1922 ruling the court stated as one basis for its decision . ' mere knowledge of the german language cannot reasonably be regarded as harmful . ' we see in this story that a seemingly purely theoretical issue can have very practical consequences in everyday life . in making a legal decision on the matter , the court also made a psycholinguistic decision , on the relationship of language , thought and culture . was the court correct ? it is this question that we shall now consider .

    designed to mow lawns. Vacuum-cleaning robots were introduced late in 2001

"think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with Bureaucracy. Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) Canada. It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own ""Permit Rajs"" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars.

"comparative method : n - ary comparison again some time ago , while we were discussing comparative linguistics , the question was raised ( by bill poser , i think ) of whether anybody ever claims in print that binary comparison is preferable to n-ary comparison . while i cited one reference at that time , i thought it might be still be of general interest to adduce one more , which has just come to my attention . in his attack on the theory that japanese is altaic ( and on altaic as a whole ) , janhunen 1992 argues that the odds of finding apparent matches simply by chance when japanese is compared to the four altaic languages / subgroups , viz . , turkic , mongolic , tungusic , and korean , are four times as high as are the odds of finding such spurious matches when japanese is compared to just one language , specifically korean ( which is singled out by janhunen because there has been a fair amount of work on japanese - korean comparison which ignored altaic ) . in other words , janhunen assumes that a 5 - ary comparison is four times as likely to produce matches purely by chance ( what i call ' false positives ' ) as is a binary comparison . this , needless to say , is a fallacy , but there you have it . janhunen , juha . 1992 . das japanische in vergleichender sicht . journal de la soci t finno - ougrienne 84 . 145-161 .",Safe Email

"" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20 to 90 days was done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , "" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . "" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i ' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does notrequire you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at m . o . c . marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20 to 90 days . before you say "" bull "" , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) to the person listed for the specific report . international orders should also include $ 1 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the required changes in the name list , save it as a text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever email program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email lists . step ( 4 ) email a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , email to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . 00 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four 4 reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number you must include your e-mail address _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 "" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales "" order report # 1 from : w . o . w . incorporated po box 2527 victorville , ca 92393 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 "" major corporations and multi-level sales "" order report # 2 from : m - tronics 32445 regents blvd . union city , ca 94587-4849 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 "" sources for the best mailing lists "" order report # 3 from rkl international 3060 w . country meadow dr . tucson , az 85742 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 "" evaluating multi-level sales plans "" order report # 4 from : thunder tech . 202 lathrop st . south hadley , ma 01075 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20 to 90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . no longer will a lack of money hold you back . however , very few people reach financial independence , because when opportunity knocks , they choose to ignore it . it is much easier to say "" no "" than "" yes "" , and this is the question that you must answer . will you ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it ? if you do nothing , you have indeed missed something and nothing will change . please re-read this material , this is a special opportunity . if you have any questions , please feel free to write to the sender of this information . you will get a prompt and informative reply . my method is simple . i sell thousands of people a product for $ 5 that costs me pennies to produce and email . i should also point out that this program is legal and everyone who participates will make money . this is not a chain letter or pyramid scam . at times you have probably received chain letters , asking you to send money , on faith , but getting nothing in return , no product what-so - ever ! not only are chain letters illegal , but the risk of someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive . you are offering a legitimate product to your people . after they purchase the product from you , they reproduce more and resell them . it 's simple free enterprise . as you learned from the enclosed material , the product is a series of four 4 financial and business reports . the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding , but will be useful to you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead . you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports , which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program . the concise one and two page reports you will be buying can easily be reproduced ; emailed to the requester . best wishes with the program and good luck ! "" it was truly amazing "" "" not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this program . but conservative as i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was no way that i could not get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i ever surprised when i found my medium sized post office box crammed with orders ! i will make more money this year than any ten years of my life before . "" mary riceland , lansing , mi tips for success send for your four 4 reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in . when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the product / service to comply with us postal and lottery laws . title 18 sections 1302 and 1341 specifically state that : "" a product or service must be exchanged for money received .

I've just changed my sendmail installation and am looking for the 'proper' way to pass it through there, systemwide, before accepting it and sending it to the users.  It's kinda problematic to set up procmail scripts for every user, when the user's home directories are NFS mounted....and the source is on my own machine, on which I try new things. (And it's the only machine with the drivespace...)

"reduplicative constructions and polarity moravscik ( in greenberg 's language universals ) notes that reduplicative constructions that do not fulfill a purely grammatical function usually intensifies the base morpheme . sometimes , though , it may actually have the exact opposite function : it de-intensifies the base morpheme . i am interested in the connection between this process and the process by which the literal message of a sarcastic utterance assumes the exact opposite meaning by means of a conceptually similar feature : exaggeration ( of , say , amplitude , duration , pitch , or clarity ) . does anyone know of any further research on this particular phenomenon ? any speculations ? perhaps there is an intimate connection here with the polarity-based cognitive mapping givon ( in negation in language : pragmatics , function , ontology ) proposed ? sincerely , anders lars anders joensson macalester college email : ljonsson @ macalstr . edu",Safe Email
