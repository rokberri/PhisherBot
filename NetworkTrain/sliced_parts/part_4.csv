 The sad news is that there seems to be a lot of patents (pending or not)
that's for very basic/general ideas; it's the current form of ""domainnapping"",
and it might turn uggly when people start trying to enfoce these patents.

20020718 Lockergnome Windows Daily
Â  07.18.2002 GnomeREPORT GET WINDOWS XP TIPS: Months after the release of Windows XP Professional and Home editions, people are still learning the nuances of Microsoft's newest operating system. Whether you've been using it for a while or are planning to upgrade to the new OS soon, this ebook is right up your alley. GET YOUR COPY of Lockergnome's Top 50 Windows XP tips now!    I don't go to many concerts, but that doesn't mean I don't
appreciate listening to good
music at every waking moment. Tonight, a handful of Bay
Gnomies and I watched They Might Be Giants rock the Fillmore.
Melanie, Steve, Brent, Missy, Robert, Patrick, Gretchen, Matt, and
Mindy had a total blast. Well, it wasn't much fun when Robert got
his digital camera confiscated - but this was a show worthy of
five megapixels
(believe me)! Brent went to
the show last night, and I saw them play on the set earlier this
afternoon. They were selling a new CD (which had JUST been
released the other day); ""They Got Lost"" is full of a few
previously-unavailable tracks. If you aren't sure about purchasing
it outright, I strongly urge you to sign up for a trial EMusic account and download
a few of their songs in MP3 format. Oh, and check out the opening
act: Noe Venable. She's got
a few free MP3s on
her site, too. Give ""Boots"" a shot - very nice.Does anybody know how to set a binary clock? Melanie got it for me
as a gift (which was a very nice gesture). Sure, I could read the
manual - but the ones and zeros start to look eerily similar after
flipping past the first page. You know me: I'm not much of a math
guy. In fact, I just discovered the other day that 'byte' was
short for 'by eight' (even though I already knew that 'bit'
represented 'binary digit'). I'd stick with a digital timepiece,
but it just isn't geeky enough for me anymore. How sad is that?
I'm ready to walk on the wild side. Maybe I'll get my laptop
pierced tomorrow? It could happen. I've been known to do nutty
things on a moment's notice, like changing my default Web browser.
Courtesy of Asa
Dotzler, I have an official Mozilla sticker, CD, and t-shirt
(which you saw me model in my Webcam the other day). Don't be too
jealous; Mozilla.org has
plenty of goodies to go around.Looks as though Jake
and Lori are already having a blast in St. Louis.
They're at the Shareware Industry Conference, along with hundreds
of well-known program programmers - the people who make our
computers work the way we want them to work! We're doing our best
to convince them to join us at Gnomedex. They ask: ""Who else
is going to be there?"" We answer: ""People who don't know you yet.""
They ask: ""Then why should I come?"" We answer: ""Because it's a
business opportunity for you."" They ask: ""What if I don't want to
learn anything or meet anybody?"" We answer: ""We can't really help
you there, but here - have lunch on us."" They ask: ""Oh, the
admission price includes food at at Gnomedex?"" We answer: ""We
cannot provide every meal, but you won't go hungry."" They ask:
""So, why Des Moines, when there's nothing to do there."" We answer:
""You're 100% wrong. There *IS* something to do there: Gnomedex.""
Get it? Got it? Good.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Chris PirilloÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â

I would forget my own head if it wasn't attached. So naturally, I appreciate any program that can help keep me on track, and with GigAlarm I can setup whatever reminders/alarms I need. However, sometimes a simple text message just won't catch my attention. Well, herein lies the beauty of GigAlarm... it doesn't just have to give you a text alarm! GigAlarm can play a WAV file (random, or your selection), change your background, start a program, or use one of the many Windows shutdown options. My wife has gotten in the habit of using the Shutdown option as an alarm to signal that I have spent too long on the computer. (Lucky for me, there is a snooze button!) NOTE: The author says, ""This program is essentially free to use for non-profit purposes... If you find this program useful I would appreciate $10 AUD (or $5 USD) as a token of your appreciation.""Context Thumbview v1.0.b1 [107k] W9x/2K/XP FREEhttp://contextmagic.netfirms.com/image-viewer/{Peep show} I'm not always very patient, especially when it comes to my computer. Double-clicking on an image and waiting for it to come up in my image viewer is almost too much for me to handle. Lucky for me, Context Thumbview has made its way onto my system and I no longer have to wait to view an image. All I do now is right-click the image, choose ""View Thumbnail,"" and there is the image, out there for me to see... all without me having to open up any programs! ""As Express ThumbView is an Explorer extension, it is always ready and available for use. Moreover, it is available in any Explorer window, including Open and Save As... dialog boxes."" As an added bonus, with Context Thumbview installed on my system, I can also turn off the thumbnail view if I want to save system resources.

Starter v5.5.4.2175 [423k] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://codestuff.tripod.com/{Startup manager} This application bills itself as ""Yet Another Startup Manager""... I don't think so! Starter isn't JUST another Startup Manager, it's a piece of programming art. One of my biggest problems with Windows Task Manager is that I don't know what all the processes on my machine are, or from where they are running. Starter not only gives me that information, but it also lets me save it as an HTML file. In addition, Starter lets me import and export registry keys or add a new task to be processed. Don't run all over your machine trying to find all the programs you need to control your PC, when you can do it all (and more!) with Starter.Recommend It!

Aversoft Sticker v3.55 [592k] W9x/2k/XP US$15
    Unearthed by Sergei Lepyokhinhttp://www.aversoft.com/sticker/{Sticky notes} Did you know that Post-it(r) Notes were invented by accident? I use to have these notes all over my monitor. Now my screen is clean as a whistle! Aversoft Sticker is a program to help you remember ""important information by displaying skinnable sticky notes on your Windows desktop."" No more bland notes for me! With Sticker, I am surrounded with pictures of paradise (downloaded from Aversoft's website). These great features are no accident. Sticker also has a transparency feature that makes the notes only half visible, making it much easier to use while working on your other programs. Don't walk away yet though... Sticker also allows you to print your notes, lock them from accidentally being deleted, and set an alarm (repeating or one-time). Speaking of alarms, mine just went off and opened up Outlook.

Â GnomeTIPGnomies are known for their willingness to help others and Alex Warren is no exception with a tip on copying text. Alex writes: ""Did you know that you can copy the contents of a message/dialog box just by pressing Ctrl+C?"" Alex also had this to say: ""When you select text and then use the mouse to drag it to a new location, the original text moves to the new location and disappears from the old location. However, you can select text and then use the right mouse button to drag it to a new location. When you do this, releasing the right mouse button opens a menu from which you can choose to move or copy the text (along with several other options)."" Those are some great time saving tips Alex! Following suit with using Ctrl + C to copy... you can also use Ctrl + X to cut and Ctrl + V to paste. You can also use all these tips on more then just text! The next time you need to copy some files on your PC, try the right-click and drag method and you will see what I mean... along with saving yourself some time.

Release Notes for libpng 
ftp://swrinde.nde.swri.edu/pub/png-group/archives/png-list.200207libpng is a library used to create and manipulate PNG (Portable
Network Graphics) image files.The 1.2.4* and 1.0.14 releases of libpng solve a potential buffer
overflow vulnerability[1] in some functions related to progressive
image loading. Programs such as mozilla and various others use these
functions. An attacker could exploit this to remotely run arbitrary
code or crash an application by using a specially crafted png image.These new releases also solve other minor bugs such as some memory
leaks in reading image functions.Since most applications which display images use libpng, this affects
many applications including Evolution and Mozilla. Additionally, Red
Carpet links libpng statically and needs to be updated separately.Ximian only ships libpng on Solaris, and so we only have Solaris
packages available. When distribution vendors update their packages,
they will be available in Red Carpet. Please use Red Carpet to upgrade
libpng to 1.0.14 and Red Carpet 1.3.4-2. You can also get packages
from the Ximian FTP site:Solaris 7/8

"eia ' s updated heating costs forecast home heating costs to soar this winter americans can expect home heating prices to jump as much as 44 % this winter because of strong economic growth and high crude oil prices , according to the eia . a winter with especially long periods of cold weather ' could cause even higher prices because heating fuel storage levels are below average . homes that use natural gas can expect to see the biggest jump in bills . prices paid by residential customers are expected to average $ 8 . 58 per mmbtu , up about 30 % from last winter ' s average of $ 6 . 61 . the higher prices , combined with increased consumption , will push overall costs up to an average $ 780 this winter from $ 540 last year earlier , the eia said in an annual report on winter fuels . high prices for competing petroleum - based fuels will help keep natural gas prices high . homes with heating oil will pay about $ 949 for fuel this winter , up 25 % from the $ 760 paid last winter . prices will average about $ 1 . 37 per gallon , up 16 % from last year ' s $ 1 . 18 , the report said . the 4 . 5 % of americans who use propane to heat their homes will pay about 27 % more this winter at $ 1 , 045 , compared with $ 823 last year . inventories of propane at the end of last month were about 62 million barrels , 3 million above last year ' s level . distillate stockpiles , which include heating oil and diesel fuel , will be about 114 million to 118 million barrels at the start of the heating season , about 15 % to 18 % lower than last year , the report said . the government projection excludes the heating oil reserve created by the clinton administration , which stores 2 million barrels . distillate stocks in the east coast are 41 million barrels , close to 40 % less than last year ' s level . in new england stocks are over 60 % below the 1999 level . the eia estimated the monthly price of crude oil will remain above $ 28 per barrel for the rest of the year , and then gradually decline next year to an average $ 25 per barrel . because of rising demand in asia and continued growth in the us , higher oil production by opec has not been able to stem the rally in prices , the report said . us crude oil inventories are about 287 million barrels , 17 million barrels below last year . the deficit is smaller than last month , when there was a 26 million - barrel shortfall , though supplies are still 8 % below normal and are not expected to move into the normal range before the end of winter , the report said . global oil demand this year is expected to increase 1 . 1 million barrels per day from last year and will grow by an additional 2 million barrels a day in 2001 to 78 million barrels a day , according to the report . the average retail price for gasoline , which was about $ 1 . 52 per gallon last week , will fall to about $ 1 . 46 per gallon in december and $ 1 . 40 by next march , the report said . the report says a very cold winter could cause northeast heating oil prices to surge , and that could spill over into east coast diesel markets . the government said the chances of this were greater this year because of tight distillate supplies , especially in the northeast . diesel prices will fall by about $ 0 . 09 to $ 1 . 55 per gallon in december and $ 1 . 35 by next summer , assuming normal conditions this winter .",Safe Email

Date: Not suppliedInterview with cartoonist Ted Rall, who has traveled to South Asia recently, 
and has tips on how to deal with bribe-hungry border guards and the like:     Rall: Now I realize that's just the way it is, and I know how to do it and 
    get away without paying a bribe, or paying something very modest. You have 
    to show them that you know the routine and that you know you don't have to 
    give them anything, and just have a low-key demeanor. But if you get angry, 
    that's just going to make things worse for you. You get out of your vehicle 
    and you walk up to them -- you don't try to avoid these guys; you don't try 
    to avoid their eyes -- you go up with a big smile, give them a big 
    handshake and sort of rub their shoulders and say, ""Hey, great to see you. 
    You're my new best friend for the next five minutes.""     GROTH: Basically act like a used car salesman.     RALL: It's exactly like that! You always carry cigarettes. You offer them a 
    cigarette, and you say, ""Hey, what's goin' on? How's it goin'? Great. 
    Here's my documents. How's the road?"" Just small talk, because these guys 
    are bored. They're in the middle of nowhere, and you're sometimes the only 
    vehicle they've seen for many hours. They're often very drunk, so you just 
    have to be cool.  Link[1] Discuss[2][1] http://www.tcj.com/247/i_rall.html

"use of bridgeline credit louise : we gave the attached presentation to bridgeline management with respect to using bridgeline credit to support enron transactions . bridgeline was somewhat positive and i have arranged for enron to make a presentation to the full board at our meeting on thursday . under one of the proposed credit structures , bridgeline would provide a guarantee to an enron counterparty . enron ' s repayment obligation to bridgeline ( in the event of an enron default ) would be secured by our future dividend payments . we used the el paso transport deal that stephanie and linda r . have been working on as a specific example of how this structure would work , and we plan to present this deal at the thursday meeting . assuming that the bhlp board approves the credit structure , is this how you want to use this credit support ? specifically , is the el paso transport deal how we should use the available capacity or is there another deal that creates more value ( or relieves more pain ) for enron ? i thought i would check before we got too far down the road . regards , brian",Safe Email

Date: Not suppliedAmazing story about the ""dabba wallahs"" -- India's 112-year-old meal-delivery 
system that outdoes FedEx using pictograms, bicycles, and largely illiterate 
(but well-compensated) deliverypeople:     As part of the tiffin distribution process, every day the meals are picked 
    up from commuters' homes in Mumbai long after the commuters have left for 
    work, delivered to them on time, then picked up and delivered home before 
    the commuters return.     Each tiffin carrier has, painted on its top, a number of symbols that 
    identify where the carrier was picked up, the originating and destination 
    stations and the address to which it is to be delivered.     After the tiffin carriers are picked up, they are taken to the nearest 
    railway station, where they are sorted according to the destination 
    station.     At the destination station they are unloaded by other dabba wallahs and 
    re-sorted, this time according to street address and floor.     The 80 kg crates of carriers, carried on dabba wallahs' heads, hand-wagons 
    and cycles are delivered at 12.30 p.m., picked up at 1.30 p.m., and 
    returned when they came.     The system relies on multiple relays of dabba wallahs, and a single tiffin 
    box may change hands up to three times during its journey from home to 
    office.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Tom!_)[1] http://in.news.yahoo.com/020920/43/1vfdw.html

each could have their own for ""development"" or ""testing"" releases. You
handled your own repo and they did a nightly stable update for example.
Also it should check that no-one can manage to put in a package with the

photo opportunity when I was in the airport a couple of weeks ago, and saw 
someone checking on a standup bass fiddle. It was in a huge plastic Darth Vader 
shipping case. The _buckles_ on the thing were about the size of my uke. I 
should have taken a picture of my uke and the bass side-by-side. Anyway, here's

""" english plus "" resolution in congress the "" english - plus "" resolution below was introduced into the house of representative on july 13 by rep . jose serrano ( d - n . y . ) , along with 31 other democratic cosponsors and one republican , ileana ros - lehtinen ( fla . ) . it is a nonbinding statement of policy intended as counter to six english - only bills now pending in congress . ( these measures include the king bill , h . r . 1005 , which would declare english the official language , end bilingual education and bilingual ballots , and require all government business to be transacted in english ; and the only slightly less restrictive emerson bill , h . r . 123 , which likewise declares english the official language and ends all federal funding for bilingual education . the emerson bill has more than 120 sponsors and is held to be likely to pass this year ; hearings will probably be scheduled once the present conflicts over the budget are resolved . ) some opponents of english - only measures have felt that the wording of this resolution is not as strong as they would like , particularly as it makes only indirect reference to bilingual education programs . still , its passage would have an important symbolic effect , and even if it should be defeated in committee , it will at least help to draw the battle lines over this issue . the lsa executive committee voted at its meeting this may to give its support to this resolution ; and in a mail ballot a few years ago the membership of the society declared its opposition to english - only measures by a margin of 94 to 6 percent . individual linguists may want to make their views on the english - plus resolution known to members of the house committee on economic and educational opportunities , whose names follow the text of the resolution below . committee members can be reached at : the honorable _ _ _ _ _ _ _ u . s . house of representatives washington , dc 20515 geoff nunberg concurrent resolution entitled , the ` ` english plus resolution ' ' . whereas english is the primary language of the united states , and all members of the society recognize the importance of english to national life and individual accomplishment ; whereas many residents of the united states speak native languages other than english , including many languages indigenous to this country , and these linguistic resources should be conserved and developed ; whereas this nation was founded on a commitment to democratic principles , and not on racial , ethnic , or religious homogeneity , and has drawn strength from a diversity of languages and cultures and from a respect for individual liberties ; whereas multilingualism , or the ability to speak languages in addition to english , is a tremendous resource to the united states because such ability enhances american competitiveness in global markets by permitting improved communication and cross-cultural understanding between producers and suppliers , vendors and clients , retailers and consumers ; whereas multilingualism improves united states diplomatic efforts by fostering enhanced communication and greater understanding between nations ; whereas multilingualism has historically been an essential element of national security , including the use of native american languages in the development of coded communications during world war ii , the korean war , and the vietnam war ; whereas multilingualism promotes greater cross-cultural understanding between different racial and ethnic groups in the united states ; whereas there is no threat to the status of english in the united states , a language that is spoken by 94 percent of united states residents , according to the 1990 united states census , and there is no need to designate any official united states language or to adopt similar restrictionist legislation ; whereas ` ` english - only ' ' measures , or proposals to designate english as the sole official language of the united states , would violate traditions of cultural pluralism , divide communities along ethnic lines , jeopardize the provision of law enforcement , public health , education , and other vital services to those whose english is limited , impair government efficiency , and undercut the national interest by hindering language skills needed to enhance international competitiveness and conduct diplomacy ; and whereas such ` ` english - only ' ' measures would represent an unwarranted federal regulation of self-expression , abrogate constitutional rights to freedom of expression and equal protection of the laws , violate international human rights treaties to which the united states is a signatory , and contradict the spirit of the 1923 supreme court case meyer v . nebraska , wherein the court declared that ` ` the protection of the constitution extends to all ; to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with english on the tongue ' ' ; now , therefore , be it resolved by the house of representatives ( the senate concurring ) , that the united states government should pursue policies that - - ( 1 ) encourage all residents of this country to become fully proficient in english by expanding educational opportunities ; ( 2 ) conserve and develop the nation 's linguistic resources by encouraging all residents of this country to learn or maintain skills in a language other than english ; ( 3 ) assist native americans , native alaskans , native hawaiians , and other peoples indigenous to the united states , in their efforts to prevent the extinction of their languages and cultures ; ( 4 ) continue to provide services in languages other than english as needed to facilitate access to essential functions of government , promote public health and safety , ensure due process , promote equal educational opportunity , and protect fundamental rights ;

Date: Not suppliedAfter the talk at UT Austin, I spent Saturday at the Turkey City science 
fiction writers' workshop at Bruce Sterling's place. Turkey City is a venerable 
science fiction workshop that has spawned many good writers and a lexicon of 
science fiction critical terms that is the de facto standard for understanding 
what works and what doesn't in a work of science fiction:     Squid on the Mantelpiece     Chekhov said that if there are dueling pistols over the mantelpiece in the 
    first act, they should be fired in the third. In other words, a plot 
    element should be deployed in a timely fashion and with proper dramatic 
    emphasis. However, in SF plotting the MacGuffins are often so overwhelming 
    that they cause conventional plot structures to collapse. It's hard to 
    properly dramatize, say, the domestic effects of Dad's bank overdraft when 
    a giant writhing kraken is levelling the city. This mismatch between the 
    conventional dramatic proprieties and SF's extreme, grotesque, or visionary 
    thematics is known as the ""squid on the mantelpiece.""     Card Tricks in the Dark     Elaborately contrived plot which arrives at (a) the punchline of a private 
    joke no reader will get or (b) the display of some bit of learned trivia 
    relevant only to the author. This stunt may be intensely ingenious, and 
    very gratifying to the author, but it serves no visible fictional purpose.

"It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** Anyone can do it.** It only takes a few hours to learn.When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.
*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.
*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 
*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.
*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 
*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 
*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.
*** Make money on the biggest news stories.
*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 
*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.
*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 
It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.Order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now for only $49.97

"coling / acl workshop on multi - lingual information retrieval coling - acl ' 98 workshop multilingual information management : current levels and future abilities august 16 , 1998 universiti de montrial montrial / canada the coling / acl workshop on multilingual information management is a follow-on to an nsf - sponsored workshop held in conjunction with the first international conference on language resources and evaluation in granada , spain ( may 1998 ) , at which an international panel of invited experts considered these questions in an attempt to identify the most effective future directions of computational linguistics research - - especially in the context of the need to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information . the follow-on workshop is intended to open the discussion to the computational linguistics community as a whole . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * registration deadline is july 1 ! ! ! ! * * * * to register , consult the coling / acl home page at * * * * http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / mainpage . html * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * workshop description the development of natural language applications which handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information is the next major challenge facing the field of computational linguistics . over the past 50 years , a variety of language-related capabilities has been developed in areas such as machine translation , information retrieval , and speech recognition , together with core capabilities such as information extraction , summarization , parsing , generation , multimedia planning and integration , statistics-based methods , ontologies , lexicon construction and lexical representations , and grammar . the next few years will require the extension of these technologies to encompass multi-lingual and multi-modal information . extending current technologies will require integration of the various capabilities into multi-functional natural language systems . however , there is today no clear vision of how these technologies could or should be assembled into a coherent framework . what would be involved in connecting a speech recognition system to an information retrieval engine , and then using machine translation and summarization software to process the retrieved text ? how can traditional parsing and generation be enhanced with statistical techniques ? what would be the effect of carefully crafted lexicons on traditional information retrieval ? the workshop will be organized as a series of panels reporting on the outcome of discussions in the granada workshop ( a report summarizing the discussions at granada will be available before the coling - acl workshop ) . ample time for discussion will be included . the discussion will focus on the following fundamental questions : 1 . what is the current level of capability in each of the major areas of the field dealing with language and related media of human communication ? 2 . how can ( some of ) these functions be integrated in the near future , and what kind of systems will result ? 3 . what are the major considerations for extending these functions to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information , particularly in integrated systems of the type envisioned in ( 2 ) ? in particular , we will consider these questions in relation to the following areas : o multi-lingual resources ( lexicons , ontologies , corpora , etc . ) o information retrieval , especially cross-lingual and cross-modal o machine translation o automated ( cross-lingual ) summarization and information extraction o multimedia communication , in conjunction with text o evaluation and assessment techniques for each of these areas o methods and techniques ( both statistics-based and linguistics-based ) o parsing , generation , information acquisition , etc . o speech recognition and synthesis o language and speaker identification and speech translation program committee khalid choukri , european languages resource association charles fillmore , university of california berkeley , usa robert frederking , carnegie mellon university , usa ulrich heid , university of stuttgart , germany eduard hovy , information sciences institute , usa nancy ide , vassar college , usa mun kew leong , national university of singapore joseph mariani , limsi / cnrs , france mark maybury , the mitre corporation , usa sergei nirenburg , new mexico state university , usa akitoshi okumura , nec , japan martha palmer , university of pennsylvania , usa james pustejovsky , brandeis university , usa peter schaueble , eth zurich , switzerland oliviero stock , irst , italy felisa verdejo , uned , spain piek vossen , university of amsterdam , netherlands wolfgang wahlster , dfki , germany antonio zampolli , istituto di linguistica computazionale , italy organizers bob frederking center for machine translation carnegie - mellon university schenley park pittsburgh , pa 15213-3890 tel : ( + 1 412 ) 268-6656 fax : ( + 1 412 ) 268-6298 email : ref @ nl . cs . cmu . edu eduard hovy information sciences institute of the university of southern california 4676 admiralty way marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 tel : ( + 1 310 ) 822-1511 fax : ( + 1 310 ) 823-6714 email : hovy @ isi . edu nancy ide department of computer science vassar college 124 raymond avenue poughkeepsie , new york 12604-0520 usa tel : ( + 1 914 ) 437 5988 fax : ( + 1 914 ) 437 7498 e - mail : ide @ cs . vassar . edu",Safe Email

MR. AYANDA MAREDI
DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY
PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA.
Good morning,It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues.
I venture to write to you perhaps you will see it fit to assist my
colleagues and I in all honesty as we attempt to seek your assistance.I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution
of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it
confidential because of the nature of this business.Within the Department of Minerals and Energy where I work as a Director
of Audit and Project implementation, with the co-operation of two other top officials, we
have in our possession an overdue payment in US funds.The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed
on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the
amount of US$29,200,000.00 (Twenty-Nine Million Two Hundred Thousand US Dollars).
Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the
excess balance unclaimed.Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed,
so as to maintain good relations with foreign governments and non-governmental
agencies, we included our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the
Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to front as the
beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts.
Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and
approvals will be secured on behalf of You/your Company.I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in
this transaction your share as compensation will be US$7.3m (25%) while my colleagues and I receive
US$18.98m (65%) and the balance of US$2.92m (10%) for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.This business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality.
It does notmatter whether You/your Company does contract projects, as a transfer of
powers will be secured in favour of You/your Company. Also, your specialization is not a
hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you
and hope that you will not disappoint us.Kindly notify me by telephone on 27-83-750 9598 or fax 27-73-219 9975 for
further details upon your acceptance of this proposal.May God's blessings be with you even as you reply.Regards,
MR. AYANDA MAREDI

( these are reliable people , so i feel confident that d speaks serrano ; d 's sister , who also spoke serrano , died recently . ) i live about a mile from the san manuel indian reservation . the people there are serrano , but most just know they are "" indian , "" they do n't know what "" tribe . "" at the tribal offices , the woman i spoke to was unaware that there had ever been a serrano language . the information i have so far comes from anthropology / archaeology people and linguists working at the morongo indian reservation ( cahuilla , in banning , california , united states ) . i ' m afraid that serrano will be history within the next couple of years . does anyone know where i might find information on the serrano language or the people who once spoke it ? * * * * * question 2 : hypothetical situation d , above , is the last remaining speaker of serrano . her serrano would be an idiolect , her personal serrano language . suppose i was able to capture all of her knowledge of the language before she dies and write a descriptive grammar which was then used by others to learn serrano , and the language survived . ( would n't it be nice if things worked that way ! ) would the original idiolect then be classified as a language ? dialect ? still an idiolect ? if serrano would still be an idiolect , since my understanding of the language would most likely be slightly different than d 's , would this be * my * ideolect , or * her * idiolect ? * * * * * question 3 : hualapai language ( in peach springs , arizona , united states ) soon , i will be moving to peach springs , arizona , to the hualapai indian reservation . i will be living there for about three months . the hualapai language is still widely used in peach springs ( still a small group of people though ) , and i am going to be doing a very intensive , crash course in hualapai ( two hours per day , every day , with two native speakers , as well as basic communication with other people outside my "" learning "" time ) . by the end of my stay , i hope to be able to communicate with others , but i ' m pretty sure i won't completely master the language in that short amount of time . my "" official job "" is setting up and fixing the computer network for the school there , but i will also be developing some computer applications in hualapai ( as opposed to an english language interface like we are used to seeing ) . i will also be working with the two native speakers to produce a few books written in hualapai . in addition to these books , i am going to try to translate some public-domain children 's classics , for example _ the wonderful wizard of oz _ , to help me with learning the language , as well as providing great stories for the kids there . i also plan on writing a journal of my learning of the hualapai language ( adult l2 acquisition study ) . i am a self-taught , amateur linguist - - i . e . , i read a lot and pester people with questions . the only formal education i have is a 10 - week course in ( english ) language acquisition by children . my question is , is there any interest outside the hualapai reservation for the software , books , or journal ? the books will be printed and we will need to know how many copies to print ( i . e . , just for use at the school , or extras for other people , too ) . a new edition of the hualapai grammar has been finished ( the old edition is 8 - 1 / 2 x 11 , 575 pages ; i have n't seen the new one yet ) , but not gone to the printers yet , and a dictionary is in the making . the software and journal can be duplicated as needed , but the books can be printed with title vii funds ( government money ) if they are for use at the school only , but we will have to make other funding arrangements if the books are to be sold to people outside the school . is anyone interested ? * * * * * fyi i developed a font for typing in hualapai . it is * not * intended to be a general-purpose , one-size - fits-all font , it is intended to allow rapid typing in hualapai . the font is a times typeface . currently , i have truetype and postsrcipt versions for ibm-pc compatible computers , and in the near future , macintosh versions of truetype and postscript fonts will be available . the sil ( summer institute of linguistics ) and a couple of sites in germany have offered me space on their ftp computers for the font . any other ftp sites would be appreciated . when i get the fonts uploaded , i ' ll post addresses to the lists . the font is "" postcard-ware , "" i . e . , it is free , but you have to send us a postcard from your hometown . : - ) * * * * * as is usual , i will post summaries of answers to my questions to the list if there is sufficient interest . thanks for wading through this long-winded message . chuck coker cjcoker @ csupomona . edu ccoker @ igc . apc . org",Safe Email

"" enron ' s employees have gotten the short end of the stick in the sudden collapse of this company , "" said labor secretary elaine l . chao . enron has said that a temporary freeze that kept some employees from shifting retirement investments was long planned and allowed another company to take over the job of administering the plan . enron declined to say how much was paid out in bonuses , who received the money or what the range of payments was . executives of companies entering bankruptcy defend such payments as necessary if there is to be any hope of reorganizing as a going concern . but they often prove to be incendiary . for example , in 1990 , when it was disclosed that drexel burnham lambert had paid key executives some $ 250 million in bonuses before filing for bankruptcy , creditors and the government reacted with outrage . in the end , after court hearings on the issue , the drexel estate sued the employees to get the money back . the payments by enron "" are substantially high , and that means it probably does become an issue in the bankruptcy case , "" said james feder , a bankruptcy lawyer with feder & mills , a law firm in los angeles . "" the question might come up as to whether there was fair consideration given for the amount of these bonuses and whether they were reasonable under the circumstances . "" if creditors can convince the court that the employees were overpaid - or that the payments were made to keep money out of creditors ' hands , a much more difficult argument to prove - then the judge can void the payments and order the money returned , said lynn lopucki , a law professor at the university of california at los angeles . to tamp down such disputes , a company typically will file a request , as part of its bankruptcy filing , to make payments to certain employees , and not proceed with the payments until receiving a judge ' s approval , mr . lopucki said . yesterday , mark palmer , an enron spokesman , defended the payments as necessary "" in order to protect and maintain the value of the estate . "" such payments "" are done in every bankruptcy , "" he said , adding that the payments were made to employees "" at all levels of the organization . "" employees who lost their jobs after enron filed for bankruptcy protection on sunday were told they may receive no more than $ 4 , 500 in severance pay . they also were told to petition the bankruptcy court to cash in unused vacation days . in another legal slap at enron , a shareholder lawsuit filed late tuesday accused 29 enron officers and directors of engaging in "" massive insider trading "" and making "" false and misleading "" statements about the company ' s financial performance while selling about $ 1 . 1 billion worth of stock over the last three years . an enron spokesman declined to comment on the suit , which was filed by amalgamated bank , which is known to be an activist shareholder . how to advertise - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - for information on advertising in e - mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with the new york times on the web , please contact alyson racer at alyson @ nytimes . com or visit our online media kit at http : / / www . nytimes . com / adinfo for general information about nytimes . com , write to help @ nytimes . com . copyright 2001 the new york times company",Safe Email

	Aren't Asian Pacfic Americans (APAs) accorded equal 
opportunity already?  Unfortunately, no.  APAs are not accorded 
equal opportunity in workplaces presently.  	Equal opportunity means: ""For every man, woman and 
child to go as far and rise as high as their ambition and ability 
will take them.""  Statistics, mostly gathered by government 
studies, show that AAs have only 1/3 the opportunity of all 
other Americans to rise to the top in the academic world, 
corporate world, the federal government.  There seems to exist 
an invisible resistance to AAs' developing to the maximal of 
their potentials  --  A Glass Ceiling.	Let's look at a concrete case.  A lot of our best people are 
employed in universities.  Their average performance has been 
outstanding.  What's their chance of rising to the top?  	University administrators are recruited almost exclusively 
from the ranks of faculty and professionals already employed in 
universities.  Hence the ratio of [administrators / (faculty + 
professionals)], broken down to races, is a measure of the 
opportunity enjoyed by American citizens of different races.  
Nationwide, that ratio for blacks (non-Hispanic) is 0.21.  That is, 
for every 100 black faculty and professionals there are 21 black 
administrators.  The ratio for Native American is 0.20; for white 
(non-Hispanic) is 0.16; and for Hispanic is 0.15.  However, it is 
only 0.06 for Asian American.  Get on the Web and check it out 
for yourself!  Source:  Dept. of Education - , Table B-1f.	The above dismal picture emerges from the supposedly 
""enlightened"" academic world.  The situation in the corporate 
world, state and federal governments is worse.  	In E-Mail 2 & 3, we present a strategy to induce the two 
major political parties to help us fight for equal opportunity and 
help make our beloved nation ""a more perfect Union.""   There has 
already been progress on account of that strategy.  Behold how the 
glass ceiling in the federal government is being shattered, owing
significantly to the bloc-vote organized and delivered by 80-20 in 
the 2000 election.

dedicated to winning equal opportunity and justice for all 
Asian Pacific Americans through a SWING bloc vote, ideally 
directing 80% of our community's votes and money to the 
presidential candidate endorsed by the 80-20, who better 
represents the interests of all APAs.  Hence, the name ""80-20"" was 
created.

"review of mon - khmer studies 27 review of mon - khmer studies , vol . 27 ( 1997 ) ; mahidol university at salaya , thailand , and summer institute of linguistics , dallas , texas , usa ; us $ 39 . 00 . reviewed by neil h . olsen , neil . olsen @ ci . slc . ut . us volume 27 of mon - khmer studies ( mks ) is dedicated to paul k . benedict on the occasion of his 85th birthday ( 5 july 1997 ) . tragically , dr . benedict died sixteen days later in an automobile accident . robert s . bauer writes a memorial tribute which includes a concise biography . following bauer 's memorial , he and other mks editors have compiled a bibliography of benedict \ 213s articles , books , and conference papers - - the most current and complete published to date . mks 27 is the third volume in the special series dedicated to recognized experts in the field of southeast asian linguistics . mks 25 was dedicated to the late andre haudricourt and mks 26 to david thomas , one of the founding editors of mks in 1964 . mks 28 will resume the regular format of the journal . although mks is generally a journal devoted to mon - khmer and austroasiatic languages , it welcomes articles on other southeast asian languages and language families . the 28 papers in this volume are more ambitious than previous mks volumes and represent a wide range of linguistic topics which reflect dr . benedict 's broad , eclectic , and sometimes controversial interests . there are papers on chinese , japanese , tai , sino - tibetan , tibeto - burman , hmong - mien , austronesian , and , of course , austroasiatic . the main purpose of this review is to briefly summarize the various papers so that readers may select those articles which interest them . the first paper is paul k . benedict 's , "" interphyla flow in southeast asia , "" which was one of the keynote speeches at the 4th international symposium on languages and linguistics , pan - asiatic linguistics , held in bangkok in january 1966 . benedict warns us that the field of southeast asian linguistics is the bosnia of historical linguistics - - a lovely landscape strewn with land mines ! he playfully formulates a law of historical linguistics : the number of linguistic errors perpetrated is inversely proportional to the median length of the roots involved . the remainder of his paper is devoted to exploring sino - tibetan , mon - khmer , and austro - tai homelands ( with a map and diagram ) , distinguishing between direct and stimulus diffusion in interphyla tone flow , and contrasting affixation patterns among the superstocks . finally , he traces a pair of mon - khmer loan - words , ' tiger ' and ' raptor ' , as they ' invade ' southeast asia . "" on the track of austric : part ii , consonant mutation in early austroasiatic ' by la vaughn h . hayes is a data-rich paper continuing ( part i in mks 21 ) his effort to validate wilhem schmidt 's 1906 hypothesis that austroasiatic and austronesian are genetically related and should be grouped under a new austric superstock . hayes claims that diachronic changes affecting proto - austroasiatic obscure and conceal the linkage between ancient consonants and their modern reflexes . these changes have contributed to the difficulty of establishing the lexical connection between austroasiatic and austronesian . this paper describes and details four plre phonological shifts - - palatalization , spirantization , assibilation , and voicing - - which took place early in the history of the austroasiatic language family causing massive mutations in the consonant system . dipankar moral , in "" north - east india as a linguistic area , "" delineates seven indian states - - with 220 languages belonging to the indo - european , sino - tibetan , and austroasiatic families - - as a linguistic area distinct from the rest of india . lists of common linguistic characteristics ( phonological , grammatical , and lexical features ) bolster the argument of areal uniqueness . read this paper in conjunction with simon 's paper noted below . michel ferlus , in ' le maleng bro et le vietnamien , describes the phonology and morphology of maleng bro , a viet - muong language spoken in khammouan , laos . data from maleng sheds light on viet - muong linguistic history , especially the syllable structure and ancient morphology of vietnamese and the development of its tones . david filbeck , in "" the protasis - apodosis construction in mal , "" gives a structural and functional description of a topic-comment syntactic pattern in mal , a mon - khmer language spoken in northern thailand . sujaritlak deepadung and suriya ratanakul , in "" final particles in conversational mal ( thin ) , "" discuss status , question , and mood sentence final particles in the ban sakat klang dialect of mal . dai qingxia and liu yan , in "" analysis of the tones in the guangka subdialect of deang , "" present a synchronic description and analysis of guangka tones . they compare guangka to other deang dialects with and without tones . deang is a mon - khmer language spoken in southwest yunnan , china . this study contributes to further understanding of the development of tone systems in mon - khmer languages . theraphan l . - thongkum , in "" the place of lawi , harak , and tariang within bahnaric , "" presents the results of field work with mon - khmer languages spoken in sekong province , laos . ethnolinguistic data and word lists are included . lawi is classified as a west bahnaric language , while the place of harak and tariang within bahnaric is unclear at present . natalja m . spatar , in "" imperative constructions in cambodian , "" notes that the cambodian imperative paradigm consists of four categories : 1st person sg . and pl . , 2nd person , and 3rd person . the center of this paradigm is the 2nd person imperative forms : any imperative marker ( except oj ) can be used in a 2nd person imperative , and only 2nd person imperatives can be used without any marker and without a subject . suwilai premsrirat , in "" linguistic contributions to the study of the northern khmer language of thailand in the last two decades , "" surveys the linguistic work , major developments , and recent research that has been conducted on khmer ( cambodian ) as spoken in thailand . a 3 - page bibliography is included . sophana srichampa , in "" serial verb constructions in vietnamese , "" examines a specific verb construction in vietnamese - - a sequence of verbs occurring together with a non-overt subject and / or a non-overt object - - within the framework of government and binding theory . zhou zhizhi and yan qixiang , in their "" on the genetic affiliation of vietnamese , "" reopen the old debate concerning whether vietnamese is a tai , austroasiatic , or chinese language . they compare 159 basic vocabulary items from vietnamese with thai and zhuang ( tai languages ) and wa , blang , and palaung ( austroasiatic languages ) . focusing on a 40 % cognate rate with wa , they examine phonetic and grammatical similarities between vietnamese and wa and confirm that vietnamese is indeed an austroasiatic language . i . m . simon , in "" on first looking into paul k . benedict 's sino - tibetan , "" uses benedict 1972 as a starting point to compare khasi , a mon - khmer language spoken in assam , with tibeto - burman , and with huffman 's ( 1990 ) mon and kur wordlists . this paper should be read in conjunction with moral 's paper noted above . david bradley , in "" what did they eat ? grain crops of the burmic groups . "" follows up on benedict 1972 and 1975 and takes a closer look at the reconstruction of words for various grain crops within the burmic subgroup of sino - tibetan . bradley draws some conclusions about the implications of this reconstruction for the original homeland of the burmic , tibeto - burman , and sino - tibetan groups . james a . matisoff , in "" dayang pumi phonology and adumbrations of comparative qiangic , "" analyzes pumi 's complex phonology and tones in great detail . he discusses pumi 's place in the qiangic family and notes that much internal reconstruction will be necessary before details of the complex initial - and rhyme-correspondences will be figured out . pumi is a tai language spoken in yunnan , china . helen potopova , in "" semantic characteristics of the tibetan honorific forms , "" focuses on words taking honorific prefixes , the original meanings of which are anatomical terms . in tibetan , the choice to use an honorific form as opposed to a neutral form is determined by social stratification and the situation of the communication act itself . semantic and lexical evidence is presented . george bedell , in "" causatives and clause union in lai ( chin ) , "" examines causative constructions in lai within a generative framework . lai , also called hakha chin , is spoken in chin state , myanmar ( burma ) . ilia peiros , in "" lolo - burmese linguistic archaeology , "" discusses what linguistic data suggest about speakers of proto - lolo - burmese ( plb ) . three main issues are discussed : ( 1 ) localization of plb homeland ; ( 2 ) absolute dating for the disintegration of plb homeland ; and ( 3 ) some features of plb cultural reconstruction . peiros proposes that 3800-3600 years ago a highly developed culture flourished in yunnan , connected more with sub - himalayan cultures than southeast asian . there is an appendix of plb cultural lexicon . k . s . nagaraja 's "" kinship terms in konyak naga "" is a data paper listing kinship terminology collected for konyak naga , a tibeto - burman language of nagaland state in india . jerold a . edmonson and kenneth j . gregerson , in their "" outlying kam - tai : notes on ta mit laha , "" offer recent field notes primarily on the phonology of laha , a kadai language spoken in northern vietnam . there is a brief overview of laha ethnolinguistic history along with comparative comments on the rather large shared vocabulary with the tai branch . they conclude that the laha language of ta mit township will prove useful in future work in deciphering the history of outlier kadai languages . wave form and pitch trajectory of two words are illustrated ; a map showing laha groups in vietnam and china is very useful . luo yongxian , in "" expanding the proto - tai lexicon - - a supplement to li ( 1977 ) , "" examines a sizable number of new cognate sets which substantially expands li 's seminal 1977 work . using lexical classification , the new cognates sets are arranged by semantic field : nature and environment , agricultural terms , etc . implications of lexical classification for subgrouping in tai langauges are discussed and cognates rates are tabulated . qin xiaohang , in "" evolution of the initial consonant clusters pl , kl , ml in the hongshiuhe vernacular of zhuang , "" analyzes the historical evolution of the initial consonant clusters pl , kl , ml in the hongshuihe vernacular , a northern dialect of zhuang , a tai language , spoken in guangxi zhuang autonomous region in china . udom warotamasikkhadit , in "" fronting and backing topicalization in thai , "" observes that , in thai , topicalization can occur at the beginning of , in the middle of , or at the end of a sentence . illustrative sentences are given and it is concluded that topicalization is closely related to emphasis . apiluck tumtavitikul , in "" reflection on the x ' category in thai , "" questions whether or not there is an intermediate level of x ' category in thai . evidence is presented for the existence of x ' in thai , in particular , n ' and v ' , and most probably a ' and p ' as well , if a similar kind of argumentation is applied . there is a concluding discussion of the implications . martha ratliff , in "" hmong - mien demonstratives and pattern persistence , "" examines the persistence of a 3 - way , person-oriented demonstrative system in the hmong - mien ( miao - yao ) family . the hmong daw ( white hmong ) demonstrative ko ' that-near you ' is discussed in detail . ratliff comments on the implications of pattern persistence in relation to southeast asia areal types , relexification , and hmong - mien as austro - tai . christiane cormo , in "" towards a constructivist approach of the japanese ' passive ' , "" recategorizes japanese passive verbs according to the pronominal approach in a constructivist framework . joseph f . kess and tadao miyamoto , in "" psycholinguistic aspects of hanji processing in chinese , "" explore the psycholinguistic dimensions of logographic hanji character processing and linguistic recognition in chinese . they review the current literature on the subject and attempt to synthesize the conflicting explanations offered by two opposing theoretical models of chinese lexical access , word recognition , and the architecture of the chinese mental lexicon . the final paper in the volume , ernest w . lee 's , "" austronesian for ordinary speakers of austronesian languages "" demonstrates the pedagogical technique of introducing the notion of a proto-language and daughter languages to non-linguist austronesian speakers from the solomon islands and vanuatu using roglai ( vietnam ) and maguindanao ( philippines ) cognates . errata for two articles that appeared in mks 26 , and a publications list of the institute of language and culture for rural development at mahidol university complete this issue . soliciting , compiling , and editing articles for inclusion in dedicatory or special issues of journals is difficult in itself ; the editors of mks have done an admirable job on the last three volumes . my only criticism is that in a few papers ( e . g . , ratliff , cormo ) , some works cited are not referenced in the bibliography , making it difficult to follow up on an interesting topic . bibliography benedict , paul k . 1972 sino - tibetan : a conspectus . james a matisoff , contributing ed . cambridge : cambridge university press . benedict , paul k . 1975 austro - thai language and culture . new haven : human relations area files . huffman , franklin e . 1990 burmese mon , thai mon , and nyah kur : a synchronic comparison . mks 16-17 : 31-84 . li , fang - kuei . 1977 a handbook of comparative tai . oceanic linguistics special publications , 15 . honolulu : the university press of hawaii . the author of this review is neil h . olsen , information planner with salt lake city corporation . he earned a m . a . in linguistics from the university of utah in 1994 . olsen has been an adjunct instructor at the english language institute , university of utah . his linguistic interests focus on south bahnaric languages , where he did field work with koho speakers in vietnam ( 1967-68 ) and in north carolina ( 1997 ) . he is currently working on a koho grammar and dictionary .",Safe Email

HiI have just installed Red Hat 7.2 on my desktop machine. I am completely new
to Linux and therefore have run into a few problems.The graphic display on my PC doesnt seem to work. My monitor is slightly
miss-aligned and I cannot run any high resolution games ( everything freezes
). In the hardware browser in Gnome it lists my Graphics Card (Riva TNT2),
and shows installed drivers...... maybe the problem lies elswhere.Another problem I have is that I cannot install my ISDN, USB modem ( LASAT
Speed Basic ), however im pretty sure its not supported by Linux, but again
it is featured in the Hardware Browser, without installed drivers.If anybody has any ideas, please let me know cos id like to use Linux more.
Please keep in mind I am new to it though.ThanksMark

"extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe - cera insight title : extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2184 overview : a comprehensive reform of gas legislation in central and eastern europe is bringing the region in line with the european union  , s gas directive . this is true both for the countries expected to enter the union by 2004  ) 05  * czech republic , estonia , hungary , poland , and slovenia - - and for candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the decade - - bulgaria , latvia , lithuania , romania , and slovakia . in cera  , s view current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for the internal gas market in eastern and central europe look promising from an investor  , s point of view . the candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the implementation of the eu gas directive during a two - day workshop held by the european commission and the world bank in paris in november . many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries throughout the 1990 s as part of their transition to a market economy . the results have been mixed , particularly in the utility industries . the 1998 gas directive ( adopted in august 2000 ) now offers a compelling incentive for eu candidate countries to transform their gas industries , while providing a road map to guide them . the critical points relevant to harmonization between the european union and candidate countries include the following : * legal framework and regulation . the legal framework is the cornerstone of enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in europe . as a result , in all candidate countries in 1999  ) 2000 energy laws were either updated or newly established along the principles spelled out in the gas directive . regulatory bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country , although issues of staffing , financial autonomy , and independence from political influence are not uniformly resolved . * third - party access ( tpa ) and long - term take - or - pay contracts . all candidate countries agree that tpa is a key to market competition . therefore , all have adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation . although the commission favors regulated tpa , the specific approaches to tpa enforcement in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases . in particular , the implementation of tpa will have to address the issue of long - term take - or - pay contracts with russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies and somewhat preempt competition . russian gas is for the most part sold to single , traditional state - owned operators that dominate their internal markets . a balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant players and the competitive environment . this is made more complicated by their ownership of large volumes of russian gas supplied in kind in exchange for transit rights to west european customers . article 25 of the directive provides for ! a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take - or - pay obligations . this derogation would apply to the companies of candidate countries with historical and commercial links with the russian gas industry . furthermore , article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only one major gas supplier , to those with an  +  + emerging gas market status ,  ,  , or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another member state . most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the european union . * price cross - subsidies . residential gas tariffs are artificially low and are financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers . in various countries , tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have been scheduled , but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce . this has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage of imported gas to oil prices . all candidate countries have set legal frameworks that include the phasing out of cross - subsidies as part of sector reform , but the actual implementation will remain politically difficult . as table 1 indicates , price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expected to enter the european union by mid - decade , but the legal framework itself cannot guarantee the pace of reform . the same goes for candidate countries that have only recently introduced eu - complying energy laws and whose entry to the european union is likely to happen in a longer time frame . * unbundling . most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of liberalization . to date , unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countries . in the future , the commission is likely to press all eu countries for legal separation (  & structural unbundling  8 ) of the businesses , and candidate countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly . table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries . as the table shows , the countries belonging to the second group have only very recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the directive , whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries scheduled for the first wave . * * end * * follow above url for full report . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 , 2001 !

  | 7.3 seems to support Chinese input out of the box, it's got
  | miniChinput and some other stuff no documentation.  [ ... ]
  | google is a bit of a dead too.
  | 
  | Can anyone tell me what I should do? I've no idea, but a relevant/useful source of info could
 be the Â«linux-utf8Â» e-list:     http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html
     http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-utf8/ whilst the list is nominally about UTF-8/Unicode and Linux,
 it often delves into related areas (such as input methods). my (vague!) understanding of the state-of-play is there are
 multiple ways of keyboarding scripts such as ""Chinese"", and
 the choice of method is a mixture of personal preference,
 equipment (e.g. your keyboard), and the tool/application
 in question. w.r.t. X11 applications, it seems to boil down to two
 approaches:   one unique to the tool itself (apparently
 `yudit' is famous for this);  or  else using what's called
 an XIM (X Input Method).  WARNING: I am now guessing quite a bit here, based mostly on
           my interpretation of what I've read whilst lurking,
           and watching a few people keyboarding a Japanese
           script years ago!   *** your mileage will vary! *** XIMs generally work as a complex compose frontend.  i.e., you
 build up your character as a series of composes of the root or
 fundamental strokes (""radicals"", I think they are called), and
 then ""commit"" the composite character to the application.
 ( yes, keyboarding these scripts _is_ quite slow, I believe
  a good typist can only do a few characters a minute!
  and I assume using a qwerty keyboard is very painful. ) some XIMs compose ""in place"", others do it on a special line,
 and some seem to do it in a special window (or the root?).
 also, some(/most?) XIMs apparently support a US-ASCII input
 mode as well --- _not_ a general Latin-alphabet input mode,
 which seems to require another TLA, called KBD, and which
 apparently doesn't work when an XIM is also being used? ---
 implying you have to switch back and forth between US-ASCII
 input mode (what us English-speakers would call ""normal""
 keyboarding/typing), and the other input (e.g., Chinese).
 I'm not sure, but I have the impression the switch is often
 a toggle, and something like . many apologies if this is completely wrong or too misleading.cheers!
	-blf-p.s.  b.t.w., you almost certainly want to be using a UTF-8
      locale.  if RH 7.3 is the so-called ""limbo"" release,
      then you may quite possibility be using one by default.--

Banc of America Securities begins coverage of Power Integrations with a ""market performer"" rating in tech notes 7/16/02 
Analyst Douglas Lee says the maker of power supply integrated circuits is building a market niche with a more efficient and reliable technology than traditional approaches to converting AC-to-DC power supplies. He also notes Power Integrations is expanding its market with DC-to-DC power supply products, and says the firm's growth is based on converting today's power supplies to its more efficient technologies. As a result, the company doesn't need a boost in end-market demand to grow, Lee says. Although he sees a large, untapped market for Power Integrations and likes its long-term prospects, Lee suggests the stock is fairly valued. He believes shares of POWI are unlikely to rise much in the short term.POWER INTEGRATIONS 18.72 5.23%

"re : 3 . 396 chomsky citations i agree with mark durie that it is less curious that chomsky is cited so much than that others before him are cited so little , at least by linguists . for example , two of the most important issues in multilinear phonology , one fairly recent , the other around since the 70 's , are many-to - one mapping between tones and vowels and * prosodic licensing * , the notion that elements of one linguistic level must belong to units of a higher level ( usually the next level up ) . both of these notions are explicit principles of tagmemic phonology ( on the first cf . the last two paragraphs of pike & pike 1947 , then read the first line of the introduction to goldsmith 's 1976 phd thesis for an interesting contrast ; on the second principle , cf . pike 1967 and his discussion of the ` phonemic hierarchy ' ) . one rarely sees pike quoted in this regard ( e . selkirk has long been an exception to this pattern , though ) . geoff pullum 's nllt column on citation etiquette in linguistics takes up this general problem . this is partially understandable since a lot of tagmemics ' insights take the unappealing form of a disjoint set of ad-hoc commentaries on the last language pike looked at . nevertheless , there is no way to deny that pike is responsible for some brilliant insights into human language . and pike is just one example . there are plenty of others . it is not that anyone needs chomsky to make their work respectable . that is clearly false , whether the individual is saussure or a student . still , if anyone were to seriously doubt that it is chomsky , not saussure , nor bloomfield , nor sapir , nor even jakobson , who ` put linguistics on the map ' of the intellectual disciplines and who has done more to keep it there than anyone else is in need of some psychiatric help . moreover , the fact that chomsky publishes more than any other linguist ( if i am wrong , please correct me - that would be interesting ) does n't hurt his citation index . his output is nearly asimovian . his influence on the field can be seen even at the level of university administration : when a department chairperson wants to convince a university administrator that linguistics has natural intellectual ties to many departments , i do not think that they would drop the names of saussure or pike rather than chomsky . it is worth considering the possibility that many of the citations of chomsky 's work could be due to ignorance - if he said it , or even if we think he did , just cite him and nobody will argue ; why look for the * original * source ? that 's hard work and laziness too often prevails . but it is also true that , like it or not , the source of many of the most interesting ideas in history on human language came from 20d-219 , mit .",Safe Email

"I have a strange problem with one user in a small network using ssh.
Everyone in the network uses ssh and they run an ssh-agent on login. This
works fine for conveniently wandering around the network and to some of our
external boxes - or did, until today. Suddenly, when one user (alfred) tries
to ssh anywhere he's asked for a password. He says He changed nothing (don't
they all) but I do actually believe him. I used ssh-keygen to make new keys
but that didn't help. I created a new user alfio into whose home directory I copied alfred's .ssh
directory - alfio can wander around free as a bird without being asked for a
password ever (except of course for the passphrase to load the identiy into
the agent).In case there was something else in Alfred' environment, I copied .??* from
alfred's home directory to alfio's, remembering to change ownership
afterwards. Still alfio is as free as a bird.We use only SSH2 with DSA keys. An extract from a ssh -v for alfio is belowdebug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT

This problem is definitely related to alfred as a user - it happens when he
logs in on differing workstations (all NFS mounting the same home
directories) and the other users (including good old alfio) don't have any
problems.

"re : 3 . 387 rules , tone grammar in response to eric schiller 's comments on modern syntax , i have a few questions and comentaries . as a graduate student myself i find that modern syntax has strayed so far into the theoretical realms of the ivory tower , that i am hesitant to delve into it . every two or three days there is another "" universal "" proposal that is proposed by someone only to be found untrue by someone else . i do n't think the only end goal of grammatical theory is to explain why language functions as it does , for me , explanatory adequacy can be the formulation of rules that facilitate the teaching of language , albeit imperfect rules in a strictly scientific sense ( are we still worried how "" scientific we appear ? ) but rules that have some practical application . the notion of economy is a good one , as a student i would certainly appreciate less "" model "" and more substance ! p . s . i hope i have ' nt stuck my foot in my mouth , it 's just that i am about to start my doctorate and am faced with the question of my specialization , i like syntax but want to do something more "" hands on "" like sociallinguistics . . . . brett rosenberg dept . spanish and portuguese univ . of arizona",Safe Email

"lrec workshop call for participation a workshop on minimizing the effort for language resource acquisition granada , spain , 26 may , 1998 in conjunction with the first international conference on language resources and evaluation granada , spain , 28-30 , may 1998 an applied nlp system must produce adequate results and must be made deployable within reasonable time . gathering and acquiring language resources to build an application system is very time-consuming , and it is imperative to find ways of speeding up acquisition of high quality , useful static knowledge sources such as a variety of grammars , lexicons , corpora , etc . viability of avoiding masive resource acquisition , if possible , must also be carefully considered . resource acquisition should include methods , based both on sound theoretical principles and practical experience , of deciding , among other things , on the amount of knowledge one * really * needs for a given application . increasing the size of knowledge sources or their number and variety does not necessarily lead to a commensurate improvement of output quality in an application , though a correlation between the two certainly exists , but it definitely needs to much increased costs . no matter how large the acquired resources are and how many of them have been acquired , there will always remain a residue of language processing problems which can be tackled only by foregoing the requirement of full automation and involving expensive semi-automatic or even manual acquisition . it becomes imperative , therefore , to assess when the static knowledge source acquisition is no longer profitable . thus , in a system for interactive authoring and automatic generation of patent claim texts , the lexical knowledge base can be restricted to a lexicon of domain-related verbs marked for subcategorization ( as the nominals are provided interactively by the author ) . the proposed workshop will be devoted to any technological and administrative facet of economy of acquisition effort . the technological issues to be discussed at the conference include , but are not limited to : - minimization of effort in acquiring monolingual and multilingual text corpora ; - minimization of effort in acquiring computational lexicons , including phonological , morphological , syntactic , semantic and other ( including application-specific ) information ; - minimization of effort in acquisition of resources for the support of corpus-based language engineering methods ; - minimization of effort in acquiring grammatical coverage of languages and sublanguages ; - methods of determining levels of reusability of existing language resources ; - balancing the needs of the application and the grain size of language description ; - minimization of effort through balancing automatic and interactive methods of knowledge acquisition ; - evaluation of potential utility of resources to applications ; we particularly encourage reports about actual practical large-scale resource acquisition efforts in which economy of effort has been a conscious choice . organizing committee : svetlana sheremetyeva , nmsu crl , usa ( chair ) eduard hovy , usc isi , usa bernardo magnini , irst , italy sergei nirenburg , nmsu crl , usa victor raskin , purdue university , usa frederique segonde , xerox research centre europe , france leo wanner , university of stuttgart , germany submission of papers papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . presentations will be selected on the basis of a review of papers and project reports . submission mode each submission should include a title page containing the title , author ( s ) , affiliation ( s ) , submitting author 's mailing address , telephone number , fax number and e-mail address . the authors may submit three hard copies or submit electronically in postscript form to : svetlana sheremetyeva computing research laboratory new mexico state university , usa box30001 / dept . 3crl / las cruces new mexico 88003-8001 lana @ crl . nmsu . edu receipt of submissions will be acknowledged . important dates thursday , february 19 , 1998 submissions due monday , march , 16 1998 acceptances and rejections friday , april 10 1998 final papers due tuesday , may 26 , 1998 workshop date registration for the workshop will be : 10 , 000 pesetas for those not attending lrec 5 , 000 pesetas for those attending lrec these fees will include a coffee break and the proceedings of the workshop . participation in the workshop will be limited by the venue . requests for participation will be processed on the first come first served basis .",Safe Email

Date: Not suppliedBen Hammersley posts a parable about design specifications, showing the link 
between Roman Chariots and the Space Shuttle. It has the ring of something 
apocraphyl to me, but it's a good read, nevertheless.     The U.S. standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 
    8.5 inches. That is an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? 
    Because that's the way they built them in England, and the U.S. railroads 
    were built by English expatriates.     Why did the English build them that way? Because the first rail lines were 
    built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's 
    the gauge they used.     Why did ""they"" use that gauge? Because the people who built the tramways 
    used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used 
    that wheel spacing.     So why did the wagons have that particular odd spacing? Well, if they tried 
    to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, 
    long distance roads in England, because that was the spacing of the wheel 
    ruts... Snopes says it's false[1], but from their notes, it appears that it's actually 
largely true, albeit subject to interpretation. Link[2] Discuss[3][1] http://www.snopes.com/history/american/gauge.htm

I apologise for wasting your time.I follow this list from home, and thus use
a yahoo account. I haven't been able to find
a threading mechanism for this, plus the
fact that the list can start to fill up
my inbox after about a week of no pruning.This is the reason for my initial grumbling. I 
would like to be able to follow what's going
on without clogging up my yahoo account.
Anyway, I should have initiated a new thread for my
different request about S.u.S.E. CDs. I won't repeat

Example the GOTO, most languages support a goto of some sort, so are gotos really bad?Is a loop or a recursive call actually any better than a goto 
or is the goto used as a kind of common enemy of 
programming syntax
to make sure people use loops or recursion?
<>Kind of makes you wonder about things considered to be 'good'.
For example people bang on about polymorphism, but is there actually any advantage in using an overloaded function based on class inheritance?Hmm.I'm only laughing on the outside 
My smile is just skin deep 
If you could see inside I'm really crying 
You might join me for a weep.

( 071 22 ) 2-73 - 61 fax . ( 0712 ) 568461 e-mail : kgpu @ home . sovtest . ru international conference : the voice of the foreign language culture tentatively scheduled for october 12-16 , 1998 at kursk state pedagogical university , russia . goal : defining general approaches taken by russian and foreign methodologists to the problem of communicative pronunciation teaching . foreign language pronunciation , vital for communication , is a complex phenomenon difficult to investigate and not readily yielding to teaching guidance . no wonder , occasionally it will be declared irrelevant and the attention of the methodologists and teachers is concentrated on more learnable items : grammar and vocabulary . indeed , either the intuitive - imitative approach with its attention to the accuracy of pronunciation or the analytic - linguistic approach with its articulatory and contrastive information , or the cognitive approach which gives emphases to grammar , or the natural approach and the silent way with the attention to the supra - segmental structures have not met the needs of communication . however , this kind of neglect of pronunciation teaching is of short duration and it could not be otherwise for evident reasons . it is pronunciation that reflects the national character , culture and spirit of the nation , the social characteristics of the speaker , their aims , motives and emotions . you would not really respond adequately to what is being said without the proper awareness of the implications of the pronunciation system . moreover , even in the recognition of grammar and lexical units we mainly depend on pronunciation parameters . in fact , all speech activities have pronunciation roots . that is why we can not neglect teaching pronunciation if we want to prepare our students for actual communication . in the communicative approach adhered to in this institution , we demand a communicative paradigm of pronunciation teaching . it implies both the communicative aim of teaching and structuring the teaching process in accordance with the natural mechanisms of pronunciation acquisition . there is evidence that communicative approach to teaching pronunciation is gaining universal support . according to m . celces - murcia , d . m . brinton , j . m . goodwin in "" teaching pronunciation , "" _ cup _ , 1996 . . . teaching supra-segmental features ( rhythm , stress and intonation in a discourse context was the optimal way to organize a short - term pronunciation course . this idea sounds promising for a more fundamental course if we take into account the psychological nature of pronunciation acquisition . the objectives of the conference are as follows : emphasize social importance and necessity of correct pronunciation point out general problems of teaching fl pronunciation develop a communicative syllabus for teaching fl pronunciation and specify the teaching units and the context of teaching definine communicative strategies for pronunciation teaching specify the communicative model for teaching pronunciation and its correlation with natural speech mechanisms define the links of fl culture and pronunciation teaching analyze the communicative model of pronunciation teaching as a component of teacher education outline the linguistic foundation of communicative fl pronunciation teaching identify the links between pronunciation and grammar , vocabulary and pragmatic context . discussion groups on suggested topics : 1 . the social load and the status of pronunciation in multi-cultural society . 2 . pronunciation as an indicator of language proficiency and cultural level . 3 . communicative teaching of pronunciation as a basis for teaching fl speech . 4 . functional and linguistic aspects of pronunciation teaching . 5 . techniques of communicative teaching of fl pronunciation . we would be delighted to discuss the problems and share our experience with those of similar interests . we sincerely hope that the integral efforts of the participants of the conference will result in solving some of the problems and enrich our practical competence . first call for papers . the faculty of foreign languages and the laboratory of communicative fl teaching through cultural interaction at kursk state pedagogical university ( russia ) cordially invite colleagues from asia , africa , america and europe to participate in their international conference . we desire to share achievements , concerns and exchange expertise in teaching english , german and french phonetics and pronunciation . all teachers and methodologists are welcome to attend . papers of 2000 words will be published subsequently in the conference proceedings . final date for acceptance of applications and papers to the above address by 1 july 1998 . kursk , a city lacated 450 km to the south of moscow , is one of the oldest cities in russia with a number of attractions interesting from historical and cultural points of view . accomodation will be provided at the hotel kursk ( 40-60 $ per night ) . participants will also be offered to live in the appartments with russian families and the students ' dormitory . foreign particapants will be met in moscow and accompanied to kursk if required . we look forward to hearing from you . sincerely , nickolay smakhtin dean of the faculty of foreign languages vyacheslav buzhinsky head of the english language department",Safe Email

The tech side of homeland defenseComputer security is becoming an increasingly critical part of President Bush's proposal for a Department of Homeland Security, as politicians fret about tech-savvy terrorists--and insist that any new agency must shield the United States from electronic attacks. Meanwhile, the administration says that it's open to the idea of a chief privacy officer for the agency.

Apple to expand iMac LCD displayApple Computer plans to serve up a new iMac model with a larger flat-panel display during next week's Macworld Expo trade show, according to sources.
The upgrade to a 17-inch liquid crystal display (LCD) comes as sales have all but stalled on existing 15-inch flat-panel iMacs. Apple unveiled the original flat-panel iMac, which suspends the monitor from a pivoting arm attached to a hemispherical base, during January's Macworld Expo in San Francisco.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which had been trying unsuccessfully to sell the 800,000 accounts since taking them over in February, shut them down after they failed certain performance measures over the past three months, said David Barr, an FDIC spokesman. Although NextCard customers will no longer be able to use their cards to make purchase or cash withdrawals, they will continue to be responsible for their outstanding balances.

around 90 percent clean, rather than 99.99 percent. Of course weï¿½ll still 
strive to stamp out corruption, but our system failure threshold is more 
achievable than one might at first assume.

"" making sense "" sounds reassuringly uncontroversial , and it has taken the insights of jerome bruner in the 1960s , and of michael halliday and his associates in recent years , to bring out the richness of meaning that this expression can carry . it is now widely accepted that sense is not simply "" there "" in the world , waiting to be discovered and documented , but that it is actually created by human beings in societies . the idea that "" reality "" is "" created "" in language also implies that there must be more than one reality , and that a number of realities can be articulated and compared . these possibilities carry major implications for language education , social identity and participation - - or , less reassuringly , for educational and social exclusion . the thematic emphasis of this conference on "" creating sense "" , then , includes the essential notions that any single form of sense can also be questioned and "" unmade "" , and that alternative kinds of sense can be remade or "" re-created "" through texts . making , unmaking and remaking meanings are fundamental aspects of social and educational experience , from infancy through primary and secondary school years and beyond , continuing into adulthood and maturity . much education has to do with learning to think , talk and write about things in ways that differ from the initial "" commonsense "" knowledge or belief that children have already acquired in their communities . to bring this about without undermining what is valid and valued in children 's lives is an enormously challenging and problematic social and cultural activity . that it is also a necessary one can be argued both in terms of mainstream rationality ( the development of scientific thinking being a prime example here ) and of critical awareness , which includes learning to deconstruct powerful people 's accounts of how the world is and ought to be , and to propose alternative accounts . full participation in social and political life is only possible when people have learned , as ronald carter has put it , how to "" see through language "" . these concerns over creating , questioning and re-creating sense are explored in this conference in relation to two domains , those of language education and media studies . in the context of formal education , learners have both to discern meaning in what is offered to them and actively to make "" their own "" meanings as they interpret and analyse experience from a variety of perspectives which may be proposed to them or discovered by them . all this raises important issues of participation and exclusion relating to learners ' personal and social explorations of language , and the ways in which these two modes of exploration may be related . the conference will pursue these concerns in the broad context of language education as its first domain . the second conference domain is that of media studies , with particular attention to media discourse and reality construction . the conference seeks to bring to light some of the ways in which realities , like stories , are invented , told , represented and mediated through available technologies . diverse experiences and accounts of reality are constructed through the interplay of language and image . these can , for instance , be presented as fantasies , fictional explorations of experience , docu-dramas or documentary coverage of events , among other things . the impact of such accounts on audiences and "" the public "" depends on many social , cultural and educational factors , but the need for modern citizens to be able to make their own sense of accounts that are offered to them , and also to offer accounts of their own , increasingly appears fundamental to effective social participation as well as to social critique . the conference looks to stimulate debate that is grounded in - - - or informedly set against - - - current theories , practices and findings of teaching and research communities in language and communication studies . another main aim is to suggest guidelines for informed , responsible and reflective practice in the domains of language education and media studies . a theme of particular interest , to be developed especially in workshop mode , is that of materials writing for educational purposes in both conference domains .",Safe Email

"workshop on dialogue and prosody call for papers you are invited to submit an abstract plus title to the esca tutorial and research workshop on dialogue and prosody eindhoven ( the netherlands ) , september 1 - 3 , 1999 http : / / www . tue . nl / ipo / sli / etrw . html introduction the ipo , center for research on user - system interaction in eindhoven ( the netherlands ) , in association with the eindhoven university of technology ( tue ) and the european speech communication association ( esca ) , is pleased to announce a 3 - day workshop on dialogue and prosody , which will take place in the eindhoven area in the week before eurospeech ` 99 . anyone dealing with theoretical , empirical , computational or experimental approaches to the interplay between dialogue and prosody is invited to submit an abstract . we specifically welcome those contributions of which the content is directly relevant for human-computer interaction . motivation now that spoken dialogue systems are becoming more sophisticated , increasing demands are placed on the way these systems deal with prosody , both in the generation of system utterances as in the processing of user utterances . on the one hand , appropriate prosody may facilitate the processing of system utterances by users of a dialogue system . on the other hand , dialogue systems may profit from taking into consideration prosodic information of user utterances at different levels of representation . however , for experts in the area of prosody it is not always easy to link their work to the developments in the domain of dialogue modelling , whereas researchers working in the area of dialogue modelling often are rather naive with respect to prosodic modelling . the goal of the workshop is bringing together researchers from both domains to provide either group with a better view of developments in the other domain and in this way stimulate progress . format the format of the workshop will consist of keynote presentations by experts in the field of dialogue and prosody modelling , combined with oral and poster presentations of accepted papers . all presentations will be plenary . all contributions to the workshop will be published in workshop proceedings , that will consist of 4 - page camera-ready papers . as an additional result of the workshop , the organizers intend to produce a working document that will contain an overview of the state-of - the-art , some open research questions , and position statements regarding the theme of dialogue and prosody . in order to maximize the possibilities for fruitful discussion , the number of participants will be limited to about a hundred . priority wil be given to persons with accepted papers on a first-come first-served basis . topics questions in this domain that could be addressed at the workshop are for instance : - which prosodic features of user utterances help the system to improve performance with respect to asr , speech understanding , and dialogue management ( turn-taking , back-channeling ) ? - how can those features be extracted automatically and be made available at the right time ? - with which prosodic features should system utterances be provided to help the user extract the information conveyed by the system , and to improve the fluency of the interaction ? - to what extent are prosodic characteristics of user utterances in their interactions with dialogue systems different from those in human-human interaction ? - how do we deal with prosodic variability in interactions between humans and machines , for instance due to level of expertise ( novices versus experts ) ? submission procedure researchers working in this domain are invited to email a 400 - words abstract ( plain ascii format ) , together with title , affiliation and keywords to diapro @ ipo . tue . nl if electronic submission is not possible , please send 5 copies of a 1 - page abstract to ipo , center for research on user - system interaction etrw on dialogue and prosody p . o . box 513 nl-5600 mb eindhoven ( the netherlands ) scientific committee gosta bruce ( sweden ) nick campbell ( japan ) carlos gussenhoven ( the netherlands ) julia hirschberg ( usa ) daniel hirst ( france ) merle horne ( sweden ) jill house ( uk ) stephen isard ( uk ) johanna moore ( uk ) elmar noeth ( germany ) anton nijholt ( the netherlands ) mari ostendorf ( usa ) thomas portele ( germany ) stephen pulman ( uk ) angelien sanderman ( the netherlands ) elizabeth shriberg ( usa ) david traum ( usa ) gert veldhuijzen van zanten ( the netherlands ) marilyn walker ( usa ) venue the etrw on dialogue and prosody will take place in the koningshof conference center , which is located in a rural setting in veldhoven , at close distance from eindhoven ( www . koningshof . nl ) . important dates january 15 , 1999 : deadline for submission of title and abstract march 1 , 1999 : notification of acceptance , instruction for authors , information on accommodation july 1 , 1999 : deadline for 4 - page camerady-ready paper , early registration september 1 - 3 , 1999 : etrw on dialogue and prosody further information for further information , please contact marc swerts ( swerts @ ipo . tue . nl ) or jacques terken ( terken @ ipo . tue . nl ) . updated information will also be available at http : / / www . tue . nl / ipo / sli / etrw . html",Safe Email

"**********************************banned cd***********************************************
*******************************June 5 2002************************************************
I have been receiving emails saying that I'm contributing to the ""moral decay of society"" by selling the Banned CD.  That may be, but I feel strongly that you have a right to benefit from 
this hard-to-find information. 
So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! 
With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion! 
  
Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. 
Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely 
new identity. 
Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated.  Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this99exit

increase the magnitude of the score.Dan

Rhapsody rulesI never thought Iâ€™d say it, but Iâ€™m changing my tune about subscription music services.When MusicNet and Pressplay launched their monthly subscription services late last year, I was unimpressed. Their music catalogs were limited, the software was clunky, and the copyright protection features seemed unduly restrictive. I wondered how they could ever compete with the seductive (read: free) charms of file sharing. But last week I decided to try out Listen.comâ€™s Rhapsody, a subscription streaming music service that recently managed to secure recordings from all five major labels. And now Iâ€™m rethinking my stance.Rhapsody is not for everyone. If you like to burn your MP3s to CD or download them to a portable player, youâ€™ll want to look elsewhere; Rhapsody allows CD burning only for a small portion of its catalog, and only for an extra charge, and you canâ€™t download MP3s at all. But what Rhapsody does have is music, and lots of it--thousands of albums of all major genres on demand as well as tons of preprogrammed radio stations. I think Listen.com might be onto something with its streaming service. Would you pay 10 bucks a month for a service that has all the music you could ask for, but won't allow you to actually download MP3s? Let me know at edit@download.com

""Web builders should be doing as much as possible to support the broadest possible usage by their target audience""
A little over half the responses put the onus of compatibility on builders.""There are far less browser makers than there are Web builders and users. So it doesn't make sense for users or Web builders to do that job does it?.""
After Web builders, browser manufacturers got the most blame, although this response makes the best argument.""The ordinary users are one group most at fault since they tend to stick to only one browser.""
Few responses said users should take responsibility, as most respondents fall into the Web user category.""As a professional designer, I say proprietary code is downright evil, no matter who it comes from--and no matter what nifty trick it does.""
Quite a number of Web builders wrote in, with many taking responsibility while noting the difficulty of testing in every browser.""Because Web pages are viewed 90 percent of the time by IE it is understandable that the time spent to make a site compatible with the remaining tiny minority has to be justified.""
A few responses quoted server logs, making the point that it's not cost efficient to make sites compatible for people who choose a low-market share browser.The e-mail address for your subscription isÂ

"california update 3 / 21 / 01 executive summary : ? situation "" confused "" but filing probably postponed until monday ? could be sooner if negotiations completely collapse , or if commercial paper holders file pre - emptively to the qfs ? qfs pressuring legislature for rate hikes , in - state generators negotiating with ferc ? davis ' s proposed cpuc payment to qfs would require legislative approval - - tough to get before friday ? absent rate hikes , bankruptcy filing against edison is still best option for qfs - doubts about gas supply contracts and market value of davis ' price proposals 1 . situation confused , but bankruptcy unlikely before monday the situation in california is described as "" confused "" due to the flurry of activity by the governor over the last twenty - four hours . it seems likely that this state of confusion will serve to forestall an involuntary bankruptcy filing until next week , when the situation should become clearer . 2 . earlier bankruptcy possible if . . . . sources believe that two events could change this and precipitate an "" immediate "" filing : 1 ) a breakdown in negotiations between the governor and the qfs and 2 ) a puc order to pay the qfs $ 1 billion , which would be seen as a preference payment and cause the commercial paper holders to file an involuntary bankruptcy . 3 . qfs negotiating with davis , in - state generators talking to ferc sources report that the qfs are currently either meeting with their lawyers are involved in negotiations with the governor ' s people and the legislature . they are reportedly "" working on keeley , "" since he has actually suggested openly that there needs to be a rate increase . sources report that the in - state merchant generators are occupied today with preparing reports for the ferc . the ferc has made demands that the generators report to them on market conditions , etc . that have governed their reactions . the reports are due tomorrow . sources indicate that ferc has placed these demands to placate the california delegation and to "" give the appearance of concern "" for the situation in california . note , however , that the ferc did not make similar demands on out - of - state generators . 4 . $ 1 billion payment to qfs requires legislative approval , could trigger filing by commercial paper holders sources report that the governor continues to focus on trying to get a $ 1 billion payment made to the qfs to forestall a bankruptcy filing . he is trying to get the legislature to grant the puc the authority to order this payment . this is in spite of the fact that such a payment would be seen by commercial paper holders as a preference payment , and that the money might have to be returned in the event of a bankruptcy filing . such an order by the puc would likely precipitate an involuntary bankruptcy filing by the commercial paper holders . 5 . why is involuntary bankruptcy still attractive for the qfs ? davis / capuc plan does not incorporate payments on existing debt and requires a less than "" market standard "" price concession from the qfs ( $ 75 mw 5 yrs , $ 69 mw for ten years ) . current spot market power prices in the west far exceed these values . qfs who are already off - line have no need to worry about "" pre - payments "" or future payments for power ; they just want payment for the power they have provided . the key weakness in this proposed plan is the inability of the qfs to fix their costs going forward . their biggest cost is natural gas . the natural gas supply contracts are between the utilities and gas providers . it would be up to the utilities to fulfill the terms of the contracts . it does not appear reasonable that a natural gas supplier would enter into a 5 - or 10 - year gas supply contract with pg & e or socal , since in the even of a bankruptcy these contracts could be rejected . the utilities remain a credit risk . unless the price of natural gas is fixed , the qfs cannot enter into 5 - or 10 - year power contracts at these prices . moreover , gas price volatility is expected to increase rather than decrease . some sort of state support is needed to fix the gas supply contracts , and there has been no indication that the state is willing to make this sort of commitment . the state legislature does not seem willing to assume more risk at this point .",Safe Email

"Foundstone Labs Advisory - 080902-APILAdvisory Name:	Information Leakage in Orinoco and Compaq Access Points
 Release Date:	August 9th, 2002
  Application:	Orinoco Residential Gateway and Compaq WL310
    Platforms:	N/A
     Severity:	The ability to display/modify configuration information
      Vendors:	Orinoco (http://www.orinocowireless.com) and
                  Compaq (http://www.compaq.com)
      Authors:	Marshall Beddoe (marshall.beddoe@foundstone.com)
                  Tony Bettini (tony.bettini@foundstone.com)
CVE Candidate:	CAN-2002-0812
    Reference:	http://www.foundstone.com/advisoriesOverview:An information leakage vulnerability exists in Orinoco and Compaq OEM 
access points, disclosing the unique SNMP community string. As a result,an attacker can query the community string and gain the ability to
change
system configuration including Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) keys and 
Domain Name Service (DNS) information.Detailed Description:The Compaq WL310 is an OEM Orinoco Residential Gateway access point.
Both the Compaq and Orinoco access points use a unique identification
number
found on the bottom of the access point for configuration through
their management client. This identification string is used as the
default SNMP read/write community string. The community strings appears
to be unchangable, unique, and not easily guessable. By sending a
specific packet to UDP port 192, the access point will return
information including the firmware version and the unique identification
value. The packet returned includes the value of system.sysName.0, which
in the case of the Compaq WL310 and Orinoco Residential Gateway,
includes
the unique identification value. The identification value can then be
used as the SNMP community string to view and modify the configuration.The probe packet:

Community name: 0392a0Vendor Response:Both vendors were notified of this issue on July 8th, 2002. According
to Orinoco, ""The Residential Gateway line has been discontinued.""Solution:Employ packet filtering on inbound requests to deny access to ports
192/udp and 161/udp on the access point.FoundScan has been updated to check for this vulnerability. For more

"comparative method alexis manaster ramer asks about the claim that relatedness and / or subgrouping should be established only based on systematic morphological relationships of the sort likely to be observed in paradigms or declensions . i ' m familiar with this claim only in a much weaker form , that morphological comparisons are more reliable than phonological ones as a basis for establishing linguistic relationships and subgroups . on this basis , for example , robert hetzron in 1976 * proposed a rigorous internal subgrouping for the semitic languages based on affixes in the verb paradigms . hetzron 's proposal that hebrew , arabic , and aramaic constitute a central semitic group is , i believe , correct ; and it is supported by much more evidence than hetzron adduces , much of it morphological and morpho-syntactic ( e . g . , innovation of novel negative markers , etc . ) . i may be reading too much into these claims of morphological priority in establishing subgrouping , but i have always interpreted them as a reaction to the difficulty of distinguishing convergent from shared phonological development on a principled basis . that is , because it can be difficult to determine whether a particular recurrent sound change in a language group represents shared innovation rather than convergent development , it might be pragmatically safer to rely on morphological innovation . thus , in the case of the semitic languages , such changes as * p to / f / or * g to / jh / ( as in junk ) would , if treated as shared innovation , lead to subgroups that are inconsistent with those deduced by other means . on the other hand , "" unusual "" changes like the change of proto - semitic glottalic consonants to pharyngealized consonants are much more likely to represent shared innovation , given the typological rarity of pharyngealized consonants . with regard to fritz newmeyer 's questions about comparative syntactic reconstruction , i do n't know of any systematic published counters to jeffers ' ( and others ' ) claims that it is * in principle * impossible . however , i think that a good case can be made that this is an overly pessimistic assessment . the problem , of course , is the appropriate context : we compare phonemes in words and / or morphemes and morphemes in paradigms , but it 's not clear what the context might be for word orders . presumably discourse context plays a role . i would imagine that if all the languages in a family shared an unusual word order ( vis a vis their dominant types , whatever those might be ) in counterfactuals , we might want to attribute that order to their latest shared ancestor . pragmatically speaking , it 's a lot easier to find information about the morphological context of particular phonemes than it is to find reliable information about the larger context for sentence and construction types . nonetheless , at least inchoately ( and perhaps it is the inchoateness that jeffers objects to ) , * some * notion of syntactic reconstruction is surely behind claims that proto - indo - european was sov or proto - semitic was svo , and the like . * "" two principles of genetic reconstruction "" , lingua 38 : 89-104 . alice faber faber @ haskins . yale . edu",Safe Email

This is the way forward, IMO.  Just wait a couple of years until

and prosperity in the E.U. and Syria, Lebanon etc start lining up and

rebuilt for Valhalla). Then you upgrade to Psyche using the Red Hat CDs.
Hopefully with the compat libraries the package will still be there
(although I doubt that since C++ is binary incompatible, so this is
probably a bad example), then you ""apt-get update"" with the new Psyche
repository... and there's where the problem will be : It will say that
there are two synaptic-0.24-fr1 packages (one installed, the other
available) with the same version but different dependencies :-/
That's why I always keep package versions lower for older distributions.Matthias--

How unimaginably difficult is this to do?
There are as far as I know, no Linux kernel hackers, nor distros that originate from this fair island right?
Right.Yes it might be very,very difficult and subject to abject failure 
in sticking together a distro.... call it Dolmen Linux (or other), 
no doubt the packaging system would be one of the first places
 such a suggestion would stumble.

 a Debian style system and others still favouring *rpm style packaging.That said other *LUG have done interesting things like making blackbox.Perhaps making a distro would be ..... umm.... fun.Just a pseudo random thought.
I'm only laughing on the outside 
My smile is just skin deep 
If you could see inside I'm really crying 
You might join me for a weep.

    the city. Truly, some things could only happen in SF! Javawalk also makes a

CNET Software and Internet
 Dear Readers,On the surface, it seems odd that Microsoft and AOL compete with
one another. After all, while Microsoft is a giant software
powerhouse, AOL Time Warner is totally different--a giant media
powerhouse. Nonetheless, they're at it again, working like crazy
to dominate the ISP space. While AOL is busy renovating the guts
of upcoming AOL 8.0, which will finally integrate the Netscape
browser, Microsoft is nipping at its competition's heels with MSN
8.0. Will Microsoft make enough improvements to finally catch up
with AOL? It just might. Find out more in our MSN 8.0 First
Take. Quick links to Services & Prices from these companies

First Take: MSN 8.0 BetaRedmond has been talking up the newest version of MSN for months,
and now, the proof""s in the pudding. Testers have their hands on
the beta of MSN 8.0, and so far, this ISP looks and works better
than past versions. The great No. 8 even has antispam tools and
improved parental controls. But will MSN topple AOL?
First Take: ICQ Lite AlphaOne of our biggest beefs with ICQ has always been its bloated
feature set. Now, the company has released a new lite ICQ that
sucks up far less system memory than the full-fat version--but at
what cost? We take an early look.Looking for a new DSL provider?The DSL Power Search makes it easier to find the perfect

"Once upon a time, Ralf wrote :> Skipping all RPM build parts except for the actual packing is not
> possibleActually it is (sort of).
To answer partly the original question, this might have been useful once
the %files error was corrected :rpmbuild -bi --short-circuit This will skip all the way to the %install and start from there. Of course,
you need to have already done everything else before, and this will _not_
produce any rpm files, but will at least tell you if everything is now able
to finish successfully.Sure, it's not perfect since if the %files error was actually because
entries were missing you'll notice it only once the package is really
installed. But for multiple typos in the %files section (like when you're
writing a spec file after 2AM ;-)) it can come in handy :-)It's also very useful if you need to override some Makefile variables
during install, when the simple cases like ""%makeinstall"" or ""make install
DESTDIR=%{buildroot}"" don't work. It keeps you from redoing all the
unpacking and building processes.Matthias--

"Dear Sir,I am Dr James Alabi, the chairman of contract
award and review committee set up by the federal
government of Nigeria under the new civilian
dispensation to award new contracts and review
existing ones.
I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge
sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a 
consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in
favor of N.N.P.C. The original values of these 
contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum
of US$12,320,000.00 (Twelve Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand 
United
State Dollars). This amount has now been approved and
is now ready to be transferred being that the
companies
that actually executed these contracts have been
fully Paid and the projects officially commissioned. 
Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to 
transfer the total amount to your account for
subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants
are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil
service law) from operating and/or opening foreign 
accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in 
return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the 
transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for
incidental expenses (internal and external) between
both parties in the course of the transaction you will
be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts
in due course. Modalities have been worked out at the highest level
of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of 
Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds
within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of
the above stated terms. 
Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves and
for mutual security of the funds the whole approval
procedures will officially and legally processed
with your name or the name of any company you may
nominate as the bonefide beneficiary. 
Once more I want you to understand that having put
in over twenty-five years in the civil service of my
country, I am averse to having my image and career 
dented. This matter should therefore be treated with
utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify your intention to assist
by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this
transaction, if favorable we will take further steps
to brief you the full details of this viable 
transaction. 
I want to assure you that this business proposal is
100% risk free as we have done our homework
properly. I quite believe that you will protect our interest
by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are
still in government service, which we intend to
retire from in full honor.Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to
enable us include this transfer in the next batch
which would constitute the new quarter payments
for the 2002 financial year. Thank you and God bless.Dr James Alabi",Phishing Email

http://www.fulcrummicro.com/press/article_eeTimes_05-08-02.shtmlIconoclast designers choose MIPS
By Anthony Cataldo
May 28, 2002  SAN JOSE, Calif. -- A group of engineers in Calabasas Hills, CA wants to
turn the microprocessor world on its head by doing the unthinkable:
tossing out the clock and letting the signals move about unencumbered.
For those designers, inspired by research conducted at nearby Caltech,
clocks are for wimps.The Fulcrum Microsystems Inc. design team isn't the first to propose an
asynchronous processor, but president and chief executive officer Robert
Nunn wants to be the first to take a clockless, fire-breathing processor
mainstream. ""We really deal with an asynchronous world,"" he said. ""We
only make it synchronous for our own convenience.""This is the kind of stuff that many in the processor industry would
consider lunatic fringe, too weird for conservative embedded-systems
designers. But the young processor company and more than a dozen others
like it are anchored in the mainstream courtesy of the MIPS
instruction-set architecture. More and more, MIPS is becoming the choice
for maverick processor design teams seeking a place at the high end by
fielding unorthodox devices. And if Motorola and IBM in the PowerPC camp
aren't careful, they could see their performance leadership in the
high-end embedded-processor market snatched away by some of these upstarts.In Austin, Texas, meanwhile, designers at another MIPS house, Intrinsity
Inc., aren't prepared to ditch the clock. But they are putting a new
spin on some old tricks such as giving each gate its own clock and then
letting them overlap. Using such sleight of hand, the company hopes to
soon deliver RISC-based processors that run at an eye-popping 2 GHz and
consume just 10 to 15 watts.Fulcrum, Intrinsity and their brethren may once have been written off as
interesting experiments, backed by venture capitalists who overlooked
some of the finer details, like software compatibility. What lends them
respectability is MIPS.Theirs for the asking One reason young processor companies seem to be flocking to the platform
is that its steward, MIPS Technologies Inc., has no qualms about
licensing the instruction-set architecture (ISA), provided that the
licensee agrees to meet a software-compatibility test suite. By
contrast, processor-core rival ARM Ltd. has granted this privilege to
just two of its many licensees, Intel and Motorola. And so far, the two
PowerPC vendors, IBM Corp. and Motorola Inc., have rebuffed most
requests to license that architecture, with the notable exception being
FPGA vendor Xilinx Inc., which has licensed the 405 PowerPC from IBM.The MIPS ISA is also one of the simplest forms of
reduced-instruction-set computing around, which tends to make it
attractive to processor designers interested in extending the
architecture. It was this and the wide availability of tools and
software that drew Intrinsity to MIPS, even though the company is aiming
at PowerPC sockets, as evidenced by its decision to adopt the RapidIO
interface instead of HyperTransport, which has been favored by MIPS vendors.Good fit ""It's a nice, clean architecture and has an open model that allows us to
add instructions,"" said Paul Nixon, chief executive officer of
Intrinsity.  ""You also get all the third-party tools that very easily
fit into our base of platforms.""There was a time when this openness was seen as a liability for MIPS. In
the mid-1990s, before MIPS was spun out from Silicon Graphics Inc., the
instruction set lacked a multiply-add instruction, so some MIPS vendors
took it upon themselves to create their own. The problem was that this
broke many of the development tools, causing headaches for compiler
vendors like Green Hills Software Inc.""We went to MIPS and said we have 20 different compiler variants and
it's embarrassing,"" said Craig Franklin, vice president of engineering
at Green Hills and a respected microprocessor industry veteran. Franklin
also wasn't shy about telling MIPS it needed to revamp its embedded
application binary interface. ""We went to MIPS and said we've done a
dozen EABIs, let's clean up yours,"" he said.MIPS took the advice and wasted little time clamping down on
architectural deviations, observers said. But the MIPS camp still has to
live with a legacy of incompatible chips in the field. ""To its credit,
MIPS quickly caught on,"" said Jim Turley, a microprocessor industry
analyst. ""Going forward, MIPS is maintaining good control but they are
still haunted by incompatibility among multiples.""If the biggest risk to the MIPS camp is fragmentation, then the PowerPC
camp has the opposite problem: architectural confinement. Though the
PowerPC architecture carries the cachet of household names Motorola and
IBM, these are essentially the only two companies that provide
PowerPCs. It's not for lack of interest. Rather, the companies have been
reluctant to cede control over the architecture. This could wind up
hurting the PowerPC cause, though.""To get a PowerPC license is impossible or very expensive,"" Green Hills'
Franklin said. ""Tactically this may have been a mistake. If you're a
Japanese company, all things being equal, you'd rather buy from another
Japanese company.""Analyst Turley, too, thinks the PowerPC camp will only stand to gain by
licensing the architecture. ""It's all about software compatibility and
tool support. The more you can proliferate the architecture the better
you're going to do,"" he said. ""I don't think Motorola and IBM can
address the entire market by themselves.""There's a chance that this could change. IBM, for its part, is in the
process of planning an expansion strategy for PowerPC that may involve
more licensing. Though it's unlikely the PowerPC camp will ever have the
open licensing model of MIPS Technologies, MIPS processor vendors may
have more than just two competitors to worry about.""We're certainly not averse to [licensing],"" said Lisa Su, director of
PowerPC products at IBM. ""The question is, how much do we do and who do
we license to. There are various ways you could go, whether it's a hard
core, soft core or licensing the ISA.""But the fear of architectural fragmentation still looms large. ""We know
that if we have different microarchitectures we have to do work on
software compatibility,"" Su said. ""With MIPS there's a degree of
fracturing. That may not always be a big problem, but if you go to other
markets -- like consumer -- it becomes big. Our belief is there is a
happy medium.""Whatever path IBM takes it will act in its own best interest as a chip
provider, not as a company that wants to hawk intellectual
property. This is why the Xilinx licensing deal works for IBM: Big Blue
is not so much interested in the royalties and fees it collects from
Xilinx, but in the dual benefit of widening the appeal of the
architecture and the revenue IBM generates from manufacturing the FPGAs
for Xilinx in its own fabs. ""We're not trying to make money off of
licensing,"" Su said.Manufacturing is probably one of the most powerful weapons that PowerPC
vendors IBM and Motorola wield. Both have gussied up their high-end
lines with copper interconnect and silicon-on-insulator technology,
still rarities among chip makers. This has helped both companies design
relatively low-power embedded processors running at 1 GHz that are
shipping today. IBM did it using 0.13-micron design rules and a
four-stage pipeline; Motorola is using 0.18-micron design rules and a
seven-stage pipe.The companies say there's more performance headroom in store. ""When we
get to 0.13 micron we'll get substantially faster,"" said Raj Handa,
PowerPC and PowerQuicc marketing manager at Motorola.Proprietary processes Most MIPS processor vendors, by contrast, rely on mainstream foundries
that haven't developed the more-exotic process technologies. And even
though companies like Motorola are shifting more capacity to outside
foundries, they're keeping their special process recipes in-house to
juice up their high-performance devices.Lacking this capability, most MIPS processor vendors will have little
choice but to come up with dazzling architectural feats to keep up their
chops at the high end. It should become clear in the next year or so how
some of the newer players measure up.Intrinsity hopes to field its 2-GHz processors by the end of the
year. Fulcrum is shooting for an early 2003 introduction. ""We're going
to shock the industry in terms of raw performance and speed-vs.-power
performance,"" Fulcrum's Nunn said. ""We really want to change the way the
world designs semiconductors.""http://www.fulcrummicro.com/press/article_fastco_04-02.shtmlThe Pasadena startup machine
By Alison Overholt
April, 2002  There was a time when every dorm room, it seemed, was a startup waiting
to happen. Throughout the 1990s, kids cobbled together business plans
between classes, won funding, and jumped into business. Risk? What risk?
Plunging into a new venture seemed all too easy.Ah, the fickleness of youth. These days, most of the kids are back in
class. Venture capitalists say that they're seeing precious few
proposals out of MIT, Stanford, and almost every other university, save
one: the California Institute of Technology.In fact, Caltech says that it actually spun out the same number of
startups in 2001 -- a poor time, needless to say, for new ventures -- as
it did in the boom year of 1999. While startup enthusiasm has faded on
most campuses, Caltech has blossomed into a robust new-company machine.This didn't happen by accident. During the past seven years, Caltech's
Office of Technology Transfer has carefully developed a strategy for
cultivating commerce. ""We focus on nurturing entrepreneurs
scientifically more than other schools do,"" says Rich Wolfe, the
office's associate director. That is, the university focuses more on the
science itself than on the ensuing commercial opportunity.That's what grabbed Uri Cummings and Andrew Lines, two PhD students at
Caltech who founded Fulcrum Microsystems in 2000. ""There is a pervasive
philosophy at Caltech that no problem is unsolvable,"" Cummings
says. ""There's a focus on scientific ingenuity that is thrilling to be
around. Caltech has so many entrepreneurs because the school doesn't
make it about business or focus on how much money they'll get out of
it. Caltech is a catalyst, moving technology from the university out
into industry, and students are thrilled to be a part of it.""Before starting Fulcrum, Cummings and Lines worked for six years with
Caltech computer-science professor Alain Martin on an
asynchronous-circuit design for semiconductor chips. They ventured into
commercialization while still in the throes of their doctoral program.That they could afford to do that points to another, more practical
aspect to Caltech's approach. Other universities typically require
entrepreneurs to pay up-front application and licensing fees for the use
of technology patents. But Caltech believes that such payments stifle
entrepreneurship, since young companies usually have little cash to
spare. Instead, the school typically takes equity stakes in startups,
and it defers collection of patent payments until fledgling companies
are financially secure.For Caltech, it's a long-term bet. ""The reality is that universities
rely far more on their endowments than they could on any fees to be
collected from the initial licensing process,"" Wolfe says. ""So we seek a
bite of the apple -- and we hope that if one of these entrepreneurs
founds the next Intel, he'll not only share the equity but also bestow a
gift on the university in remembrance that we took care of him when he
was just getting started.""Cummings and Lines may be in a position to do just that. Fulcrum has won
about $20 million in venture funding amid the toughest venture market in
recent history. Its founders have hired a credible CEO, Bob Nunn, who
formerly ran Vitesse's telecom division, and hired 24 top students from
their alma mater. And they've garnered rave reviews of their chip design
from technology journals.One thing that Cummings and Lines haven't done yet: finished their
degrees. Officially, both are now ""on leave."" They may not be back.----

High-tech startups fail for only three reasons: stupidity, luck, and greed. Tip one for would-be entrepreneurs: Avoid stupid and unlucky people. If
you are stupid or have bad luck, don't start a high-tech business.Tip two for would-be entrepreneurs: Do a product that you want to do,
not one that they want you to do.Startup founders generally have only ideas, charisma, and equity to work
with. Ideas and charisma are cheap, but equity is expensive.  To make a
start-up work, the founder has to divvy out parts of the business at
just the right rate to keep everyone happy until the product is a
success. Give away too much of your company too soon to a venture
capitalist, to your co-workers, or even to yourself, and you risk
running out of distributable shares before the product is done. And that
probably means the product won't be done. Ever.Tip three for would-be entrepreneurs: Don't take venture funding too soon. If you are doing a software product, don't take venture money until you
need it to introduce the product.  Don't take venture money until you
have used up all of your own money, your mother-in-law's money, and
everything you can borrow.Bootstrap. Rent, don't buy. Don't hire people to do things you can
contract out because contractors don't require stock options.As the founder, the man or woman with the grand plan, your function is
to manage the distribution of your own holdings so that you end up with
fewer shares but more wealth.Tip four for would-be entrepreneurs: Invite me to lunch. I'm a cheap date.  -- Robert X. Cringely, http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20010614.html

"phonetics texts dear linguists , last month i posted a query on phonetics texts suitable for a 10 - week undergraduate course . i received many helpful responses from : chuck coker , yoshi asano , marc picard , charles read , darlene lacharite , nigel love , geoffrey nathan , steve seegmiller , don churma , frances ingemann , peter ladefoged , hal edwards , and one linguist who preferred not to be listed . thanks to all of you ! the book most often recommended is peter ladefoged 's , but others are also recommended in cases where the course is focused on the description of english only . geoff nathan pointed out that there are hypertext programs with examples stored as sound files that go with ladefoged 's text ; the edwards text has accompanying workbook , instructor 's manual and lab tapes . marc picard very kindly sent me the bibliography he gives to students in his class . i hope he does not mind that i have added to it the items referred to in the other replies i received to create the enclosed summary bibliography . call numbers are from marc 's list , and are those from libraries in montreal , for those of you lucky enough to live there . again , my thanks to all who replied ! susan meredith burt here is the combined list of references : abercrombie , david ( 1967 ) elements of general phonetics . edinburgh university press .

how's about the String Joke?A piece of string and his friend walks into a bar.  The barman says
""sorry, we don't serve string here"".  String & friend walk out
(grumbling).  String asks friend ""listen, could you tatter my ends and
tie me up?""  Friend obliges, and they return; barman says ""aren't you
that piece of string I threw out?""  ""No, I'm a frayed knot.""--j.

I'm not a banker, and I'm not a credit expert - but these people
speak from personal and professional experience. Draw your own
conclusions. Lockergnomie Sang Vo writes: ""Though you may have
zero liability for a fraudulent transaction, the paperwork and red
tape to work through if someone empties out all your funds can
leave you hurting for a while. There are many credit cards that
now offer zero liability for fraudulent transactions. So, contact
your credit card provider / bank to see if you can have such a
plan added to your card or if you can apply for one that does.""
And Russ Coover continues: ""If you purchase something with a
credit card, and you later decide to dispute the purchase (for a
reason such as the product was faulty and the merchant refuses to
replace it or, perhaps the product was never delivered), you can
legally dispute the charge with your credit card company. However,
if you use a debit card to make that purchase, you have no right
to dispute the charge.""Jeff Morgan has a different interpretation of the regulation in
question (E): ""In 12 CFR II, Section 205.6, it's saying that if
you give your financial institution timely notice of the theft of
your card or PIN code (two business days), you are liable for no
more than $50, otherwise you may be liable for up to $500."" And
Tim Miller extends the translation: ""If someone puts a false
charge on a credit card, the worse that will happen is your
liability for $50, with the possibility that your next charge
might not go through because the thief used all of your available
balance.  If a false charge goes against your debit card and wipes
out your bank balance, however, outstanding checks can bounce.
 Your bank may be able to get you all of your money back, but the
payees of those bounced checks might sock you with $20-25
insufficient fund fees - and they are under no obligation to waive
those fees.  If you have  5 checks outstanding, you could be out
over $100.""Frank Reyes was apparently lucky: ""Someone recently obtained my
debit card number through a local grocery store. I was told by the
checker at the grocery store that the card readers would only
accept Visa cards not ATM cards. I was very suspicious, and used
my debit card instead. Apparently, the store's computer had been
hacked, and my debit card number and name (among several
others)were forwarded to an unscrupulous individual. I was
reviewing my checking account online two days later, and noticed
an unauthorized charge against my account ($60.00). I contacted
the vendor that had charged my account and informed them of the
fraudulent charge. The vendor stopped the shipment, provided the
shipping address to my bank, and credited my account within 5 days
after I informed them (The delay in the fund reversal was due to
the 4th of July weekend). The only negative aspect is the fact
that I had to request a new debit card, which has yet to arrive.""Further thoughts from Lockergnomie James Simbro: ""I'm not totally
sure on this, but I've been warned against using a debit card for
online purchases.  Yes, you may not be liable for any of the
false charges on a debit card (in the end), but in the meantime
(during your dispute) the money will be withheld from your account
and you will not have access to it. However with a credit card,
you are not responsible for funds that are in dispute. The
scenario I was given, was imagine if somebody falsely used your
debit card and cleaned out your checking account?  The money is
gone! False charges on a credit card are not ""real money"" until
somebody has to pay them.  I would guess that each bank has
different policies for debit card fraud. I might just have to call
mine and see what I'd face."" In short, be careful - no matter what
you use or where you choose to use your plastic.

Transloaderhttp://www.transloader.com/""This site makes it easy to transfer files to your Web server.
Mostly it is useful for sites like FlamingText.com and
ImageBot.com to send generated images to another server (such as
your Web or FTP server). This is particularly useful for WebTV
users who can't save images on their own machine. Although we have
no pre-set limits (okay, it's 2.4 GB), the transfers that you do
through Transloader.com must be completed in five minutes. This
server is capable of transferring over 1 Gig per minute; if you
are talking to a slow server, your job may not complete in time.
Other transloaders sometimes suffer from overloading (too many
people using them), which is why I wrote this one. Hopefully, this
will never happen to us, but in any case, check these others out,
they have some nice services...""Recommend It!

Online BrandingTo Share or Not to Share
Scribbled by Lee SmithI think that online file sharing is dependent on the file that is
being shared. If the song is a current release or recent, then I
do not believe in it. I can't consider it stealing because you
can't steal from someone who willingly puts the file up for
downloading. Those who did put the file online most likely feel
that it is also not stealing, since they purchased the CD.
However, I do not agree with RIAA or recording companies who are
attempting to make their CDs ""rip proof"" either. I do not feel
they have the right to dictate what songs I can listen to or when
or in what order. I like to rip specific songs from CDs then make
my own CD, which either goes down to my entertainment system or to
my truck. The master CD is saved and rarely played (""why"" is
explained later in this message). I prefer making my own CDs for
my truck because if my truck were to be broken into and my CDs
stolen, it would be much easier to replace a self-burned CD than a
master. Sometimes, masters cannot be replaced without a large
expense, if at all.If the song is outdated, an oldie (so to speak), and is not
available anywhere, then yes, I do believe in it. Or, if the song
being sought is wanted to rejuvenate one's collection, then yes, I
do believe in that, too. Case in point: as a kid, I collected a
lot of 45s and record albums. I have more than 4,000 records in my
collection. Many were played so much that they are not playable
anymore and, even though I did take care of them, due to the cheap
stereos and record players in the 60s, they are 'shot.' I want to
relive some of my younger days through music, but attempting to
convert those records (to digital) is next to impossible for me.
So, in this instance, no, I do not think it is illegal to seek out
digitalized copies of the old songs that I already have records of
(albums and/or 45s). If, however, the song(s) that I am seeking
are available on CD, then I will be very quick to purchase that CD
from Tower Records, The Warehouse, or any other reputable dealer.For those that are impossible to find ""digitals"" for, then, one
day, perhaps I will reach a point with technology (and money)
where I can transfer those platters to WAV and they will sound as
good as when they were originally recorded. I have been lucky
enough to find some on CD thanks to the Internet; I was quick to
purchase the disc, usually from the original artists themselves.
Some of the music that I have, sadly, will never be heard again. I
blame RIAA and the recording industry for that, too. Neither seem
to care about the ""lost"" songs when digitally remastered CDs are
released.Submit Your Thoughts | Recommend It!

Top 75 Tech SitesWho can save you from making a small oversight with your digital
video camera purchase? Lockergnomie Frank Kenna: ""I see that
you're thinking of getting a DV camera. I got one about a month
ago, and I made one mistake: I didn't get one with A/V INPUTS.
Mine has A/V outputs, which are great for getting your digital
stuff out onto VHS, etc. But without the inputs, there's no way to
get VHS or old 8mm footage into the camera. With inputs, not only
can you get your old 8mm & VHS stuff onto DV tapes, but you can
use the camera as a pass-through device and get the old stuff
directly onto your computer for editing purposes. I wish someone
had made clear the advantages and importance of inputs when I
bought my DV camcorder. The reviews and magazines I read barely
mentioned this feature - and nobody stressed its importance. But
if you're going to be doing any editing, it is critical (if you
want to work on any of your old stuff). Don't make the same
mistake I did - make SURE you get this feature. It doesn't seem to
impact the price of the cameras; some offer it and some don't.""
This advice came not a moment too soon for me. Thank you for
helping us, Frank!

Date: Not suppliedWe did a great panel on DRM and the Digital Hub yesterday here at OSXCon with 
Tim O'Reilly, Victor Nemachek (from El Gato, makers of the EyeTV digital TV 
recorder for the Mac), Dan Gillmor, and JD Lasica, who's working on a book on 
fair use and copyfights. Glenn ""802.11b Networking News"" Fleishman took great 
notes through the talk:     Dan: Tim, you're a ""content or copyright holderï¿½talk about these issues.""     Obscurity can be a tool. Something like 100K books published in the US. 
    Most books are forgotten after publication. Ravening copying theft is 
    wrong: most aren't pirated. Publishers puts book that someone sweated over 
    for years on shelves for three months, doesn't sell, that's it, and the 
    author has no rights. Publishers keeps rights til out of print, etc.     Oblivion is fate of most books: ""Piracy would be the best thing for those 
    books."" People wouldn't pirate them in general, because people generally 
    like to respect the rights of creators. ""Piracy is a marginal act; it takes 
    away some of the cream.""     Publishing won't go away, but it will change the idea of who is a 
    publisher. Early on in the Web, the idea was that everyone could be a 
    publisher. The way in which Web sites interact with publishers is often 
    very much like the way that book publishers try to get placement and 
    position in bookstores.     Publishing is aggregation. People will re-emerge as publishers. Will 
    Hollywood be the publishers of the future or will someone else?     Users are voting by their use of programs like Kazaa. Eventually, media 
    companies will adopt. But if the changes are hardcoded into law, then we're 
    stuck for a long time with ""some mistakes.""  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via Dan Gillmor's eJournal[3]_)[1] http://blog.glennf.com/gmblog/archives/00000254.htm

"important info about your 401 k plan dear enron employee , i am a retirement plan specialist with raymond james & associates ( rjf - nyse ) . i understand these are trying times at your company and i hope that your are not too heavily affected by the current distressed financial situation of your company . i once was employed by a company that filed bankruptcy so i speak from experience and have previously been placed in your precarious position . being a retirement plan specialist , and having worked with associates that have enron clients , i want to share some important information about your retirement plan benefits . should you have any questions about retirement plans your queries are more than welcome . i want to make you aware that you are allowed to rollover into an individual ira any portion of your retirement benefit plan which you have contributed to as an in service distribution provided you have met enron ' s vesting requirement , which is either 2 or 5 years of participation . i would strongly recommend that it is probably a good idea to think about doing so with th exception of your enron stock . there are other factors to consider however like the possibilty of forfeiting loan provisions should enron pull through among others . keep in mind however , that although your current asset holdings are protected by erisa , should the company file bankruptcy those assets remaining in the company sponsored plan can be frozen for an unspecified amount of time , denying you access to your funds . an ira rollover gives you more flexibility and choices of investments and seperates the assets from company control . if you have questions or need assistance in rolling over your plan assets please call me at 1 - 800 - 523 - 3295 from 8 - 5 est or email me at jsarlat @ 33 e . rjf . com . my personal and corporate website can be found at www . raymondjames . com / johnsarlat should you require more information about my personal or companies qualifications . please inform your co - workers about their rights and options under the plan . obviously time is of the essence ! i wish you the best of luck and hope that the challenging environment changes for the better . i have included an article at the bottom of this page . . sincerely , john sarlat > john c . sarlat financial advisor , investments raymond james spread your risks by diversifying your holdings . traditional "" defined benefit "" retirement plans are subject to a 10 percent limit on investments in employer stock , but there is no such limit for "" defined contribution "" plans like the 401 ( k ) . u . s . senator barbara boxer tried a few years ago to have the same limit apply to 401 ( k ) plans , but the measure ran into vigorous opposition from employers who wanted to retain the right to make their matching contributions in their own stock . as the rules stand companies are allowed to make all of their matching contributions in their own stock and workers may also put all of their own money into company stock too . diversification is thwarted in many cases by regulations that prevent employees from selling company stock before they reach a certain age - - 50 in enron ' s case . james delaplane of the american benefits council , an employer group , said the 401 ( k ) system places great responsibility for retirement savings on individual workers . "" there are people who think that ' s the greatest thing since sliced bread and there are people who think that ' s the worst thing , "" he said . delaplane said his organization wants to preserve employers ' right to contribute company stock to employee retirement plans but also supports efforts to educate workers so that they can make better informed investment decisions . david certner , a pensions specialist with the american association of retired persons ( aarp ) , said there is plenty of work to be done in that area . "" many employees aren ' t aware of basic rules of investing , nor of the meaning of diversification . some actually view employer stock as a less risky investment than a mutual fund , "" he said .",Safe Email

"contrastive linguistics and translation - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - call for papers and participation symposium contrastive linguistics and translation studies empirical approaches universit catholique de louvain louvain - la - neuve , belgium 5 - 6 february , 1999 introduction over the last few years an important change has taken place in research into contrastive linguistics and translation studies . whereas previously both fields have drawn on largely introspective methodologies , most research is now conducted on large bodies of bilingual or multilingual data , a change which has had the important effect of providing the two disciplines with a much more solid empirical basis . many researchers are now working with computerised data , in many cases using specifically designed linguistic software tools to conduct automatic or semi-automatic analyses . bilingual concordancers are a case in point . research projects along these lines are becoming more widespread throughout the academic community and initial results are highly encouraging , revealing the enormous potential of computerised corpus analyses both for contrastive linguistics and translation studies . of course many researchers are still opting to use purely manual methods of analysis : indeed for many types of linguistic analysis ( semantic or discourse analysis for example ) , they will remain the only option for the foreseeable future . it is also notable that there are very few bilingual computer corpora available . for many therefore , the use of manual methods may not be a question of choice . this symposium is intended to bring together specialists in the fields of contrastive linguistics and translation studies conducting research on bilingual or multilingual corpora of any type . one important objective will be to demonstrate to what extent detailed corpus analysis can support , contradict or refine introspective contrastive analyses . another key aim is to examine the strengths and weaknesses of manual and automatic methods of data analysis . and lastly , the meeting will provide a valuable opportunity to exchange and share data , a step on the way to setting up an international multilingual databank available to everyone working in the field . symposium topics below is a non-exhaustive list of subject areas which we hope to address during the symposium : - contrastive lexicology ( in particular , contrastive phraseology ) - bilingual / multilingual lexicography - contrastive semantics - contrastive syntax - contrastive pragmatics - compiling and exploiting bilingual / multilingual computerised corpora - software tools for the analysis of bilingual corpora ( bilingual concordancing , automatic alignment , multilingual part-of - speech tagging , etc . ) - bilingual corpora and automatic / computer-aided translation languages english and french will be the two official symposium languages , with most papers given in english . symposium venue the symposium will take place in louvain - la - neuve , an entirely pedestrian university campus which , with its cafes , restaurants , shops , sports centre , cinema and theatre , offers all the advantages of a real town . 20 minutes away from brussels , it is easy to reach by car , train and plane , brussels national airport being within very easy reach . deadline for abstracts anyone wishing to present a paper at the symposium should send a one page abstract in electronic format ( preferably a word attachment ) to sylviane granger ( address below ) by 16 october 1998 at the latest . notification of acceptance will be given by 6 november 1998 . payment the cost of the symposium is as follows : - before 30 november 1998 : 2500 belgian francs - after 30 november 1998 : 3500 belgian francs this includes the symposium fee , the book of abstracts , coffee breaks and lunch on both days . accommodation two types of accommodation are on offer : - chambre la rsidence universitaire ( le relais , rue de la gare 6 , 1348 louvain - la - neuve ) : 1600 fb par nuit , petit djeuner inclus ;

"An old Indian friend forwarded this to me a while ago.http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A58173-2002Mar7&notFound=trueSlaughter in the Name of God
By Salman Rushdie
Friday, March 8, 2002; Page A33 Washington PostThe defining image of the week, for me, is of a small child's burned and 
blackened arm, its tiny fingers curled into a fist, protruding from the 
remains of a human bonfire in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, in India. The murder 
of children is something of an Indian specialty. The routine daily 
killings of unwanted girl babies . . . the massacre of innocents in 
Nellie, Assam, in the 1980s when village turned against neighboring 
village . . . the massacre of Sikh children in Delhi during the 
horrifying reprisal murders that followed Indira Gandhi's assassination: 
They bear witness to our particular gift, always most dazzlingly in 
evidence at times of religious unrest, for dousing our children in 
kerosene and setting them alight, or cutting their throats, or 
smothering them or just clubbing them to death with a good strong length 
of wood.I say ""our"" because I write as an Indian man, born and bred, who loves 
India deeply and knows that what one of us does today, any of us is 
potentially capable of doing tomorrow. If I take pride in India's 
strengths, then India's sins must be mine as well. Do I sound angry? 
Good. Ashamed and disgusted? I certainly hope so. Because, as India 
undergoes its worst bout of Hindu-Muslim bloodletting in more than a 
decade, many people have not been sounding anything like angry, ashamed 
or disgusted enough. Police chiefs have been excusing their men's 
unwillingness to defend the citizens of India, without regard to 
religion, by saying that these men have feelings too and are subject to 
the same sentiments as the nation in general.Meanwhile, India's political masters have been tut-tutting and offering 
the usual soothing lies about the situation being brought under control. 
(It has escaped nobody's notice that the ruling party, the Bharatiya 
Janata Party (BJP), or Indian People's Party, and the Hindu extremists 
of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), or World Hindu Council, are sister 
organizations and offshoots of the same parent body.) Even some 
international commentators, such as Britain's Independent newspaper, 
urge us to ""beware excess pessimism.""The horrible truth about communal slaughter in India is that we're used 
to it. It happens every so often; then it dies down. That's how life is, 
folks. Most of the time India is the world's largest secular democracy; 
and if, once in a while, it lets off a little crazy religious steam, we 
mustn't let that distort the picture.Of course, there are political explanations. Ever since December 1992, 
when a VHP mob demolished a 400-year-old Muslim mosque in Ayodhya, which 
they claim was built on the sacred birthplace of the god Ram, Hindu 
fanatics have been looking for this fight. The pity of it is that some 
Muslims were ready to give it to them. Their murderous attack on the 
train-load of VHP activists at Godhra (with its awful, atavistic echoes 
of the killings of Hindus and Muslims by the train-load during the 
partition riots of 1947) played right into the Hindu extremists' hands.The VHP has evidently tired of what it sees as the equivocations and 
insufficient radicalism of India's BJP government. Prime Minister Atal 
Bihari Vajpayee is more moderate than his party; he also heads a 
coalition government and has been obliged to abandon much of the BJP's 
more extreme Hindu nationalist rhetoric to hold the coalition together. 
But it isn't working anymore. In state elections across the country, the 
BJP is being trounced. This may have been the last straw for the VHP 
firebrands. Why put up with the government's betrayal of their fascistic 
agenda when that betrayal doesn't even result in electoral success?The electoral failure of the BJP is thus, in all probability, the spark 
that lit the fire. The VHP is determined to build a Hindu temple on the 
site of the demolished Ayodhya mosque -- that's where the Godhra dead 
were coming from -- and there are, reprehensibly, idiotically, 
tragically, Muslims in India equally determined to resist them. Vajpayee 
has insisted that the slow Indian courts must decide the rights and 
wrongs of the Ayodhya issue. The VHP is no longer prepared to wait.The distinguished Indian writer Mahasveta Devi, in a letter to India's 
president, K. R. Narayanan, blames the Gujarat government (led by a BJP 
hard-liner) as well as the central government for doing ""too little too 
late."" She pins the blame firmly on the ""motivated, well-planned out and 
provocative actions"" of the Hindu nationalists. But another writer, the 
Nobel laureate V. S. Naipaul, speaking in India just a week before the 
violence erupted, denounced India's Muslims en masse and praised the 
nationalist movement.The murderers of Godhra must indeed be denounced, and Mahasveta Devi in 
her letter demands ""stern legal action"" against them. But the VHP is 
determined to destroy that secular democracy in which India takes such 
public pride and which it does so little to protect; and by supporting 
them, Naipaul makes himself a fellow traveler of fascism and disgraces 
the Nobel award.The political discourse matters, and explains a good deal. But there's 
something beneath it, something we don't want to look in the face: 
namely, that in India, as elsewhere in our darkening world, religion is 
the poison in the blood. Where religion intervenes, mere innocence is no 
excuse. Yet we go on skating around this issue, speaking of religion in 
the fashionable language of ""respect."" What is there to respect in any 
of this, or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around 
the world in religion's dreaded name? How well, with what fatal results, 
religion erects totems, and how willing we are to kill for them! And 
when we've done it often enough, the deadening of affect that results 
makes it easier to do it again.So India's problem turns out to be the world's problem. What happened in 
India has happened in God's name. The problem's name is God.Salman Rushdie is a novelist and author of the forthcoming essay 
collection ""Step Across This Line.""Â© 2002 The Washington Post Company

"Dear sir,,
My name is DR Steven M Duba , the son of MR. Theo
Duba of Zimbabwe. I got your address from South
African Information exchange Johannesburg.
.Due to the previous war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supporters
to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he
ordered all the White owned farmers to surrender all
their farms to his party members and his followers. My
father was a victim of this oppression and inhuman
behavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our
country,my fayher was totaly against the act by the
presidnt MUGABE. The presidentï¿½s supporters invaded my
fatherï¿½s farm, burnt everything in the farm, arrested
him and confiscated all his investment.Early last year when this victimization of white
farmers by president Mugabe started, my late father
envisaged a worse situation, he arranged almost all
his money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of
Zimbabwe through Diplomatic means to South Africa.
When he arrived South Africa, he lodged the box in a
private security company through the help of his
lawyer here in South Africa without revealing the real
contents of the box to the security company, then,
went back home. He registered the box as family
treasure.While he was still in detention that led to his death
due to torture, he directed me to his lawyer in South
Africa because of the escalation of the crisis in
Zimbabwe. He did not want my life to be in danger. He
was arrested on the 5th of March last year.
Unfortunately my dear father died on the 10th of
December 2001.I came to south Africa March,2002.Now my stay here in Africa is frustrating and
depressing because my fatherï¿½s lawyer is presently
hospitalized in London due to terrible heart problem;
though the lodgment documents are with me, as such I
want to relocate to your country for good. Presently,
my residence permit here in South Africa is an Asylum
permit as a refugee.I am seeking for your assistance in transferring the
money in the security company (US$15 Million) out of
this country to your country for investment. If you
think you can help me, Please try to get in touch with
me immediately with the  number below . Your
compensation/share for assistance will be negotiated
if you are ready to assist me. Since the problem in my
country is still lingering, please endeavor to keep
this information to yourself and secret, because I
wouldnï¿½t want anything that will expose me, and the
existence of this money.Your urgent response will be highly appreciated.Sincerely yours,STEVEN DUBA (DR).TEL:27-83-713-2696

"*** PLEASE READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END ***
Â 
Try it. Just for fun. It will cost you 25$ to earn at least thousands of dollars !!! This thing 
is legal because you are buying and selling something of value: marketing reports.
Â 
There is MY true story.
Â 
I received by email the instructions include in this letter. It interests me because the 
system was quite simple. In the list of people selling the reports (as you will see above), 
there was a guy living not so far. I searched for his phone number and I called him. I just 
wanted to know if this system was really working. He told me his business was going 
very well and he was receiving from 50$ to 150$ in CASH everyday! That's why I went 
into this thing!
Â 
Â 
THANK'S TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
=========================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!
Â 
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing 
about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national 
weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program 
described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated 
whether or not the program was legal.
Â 
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the 
participation in the program and if people can ""follow the simple instruction"" they are 
bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''.
Â 
== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ==
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Â 
If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, 
please read the following... THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!
Â 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Â 
FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!
Â 
INSTRUCTIONS:
Â 
=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====
Â 
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE 
ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON 
THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR 
ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.
Â 
===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
Â 
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. 
Â 
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.
Â 
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different 
individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 
1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and 
keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer.
Â 
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, 
or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 
through 6 '' or you will loose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the 
way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. 
Â 
Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT work!!! People 
have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the 
money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to be greedy and then 
nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. 
Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 
Â 
This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it. 
Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time.
Â 
1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name 
& address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and 
is no doubt counting their fortune.
Â 
2..Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
Â 
3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
Â 
4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
Â 
5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2
Â 
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.
Â 
PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! This is critical 
to YOUR success.
Â 
Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO 
NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
Â 
Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with 
marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with 
invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where 
to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 primary methods to 
get this venture going:
Â 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
=========================================
Â 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You 
and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing 
receive only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets 
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e-mails 
instead of only 5,000 each).
Â 
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, 
that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-
mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with 
orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.
Â 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% 
response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.
Â 
Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail sent out. The 
0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.
Â 
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000(50 million) e-
mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5. 
Â 
Â 
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars).
Â 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... 
$50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... 
Grand Total = $555,550.00
Â 
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST 
POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL 
STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !
=========================================
Â 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 
5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or 
half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more?
Â 
There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting, with thousands 
more coming on line every day. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!
Â 
METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
=========================================
Â 
Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places 
to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We 
strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you go along. For 
every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. 
Always provide same day service on all orders.
Â 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will 
be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report.
Â 
=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ==============
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply 
about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it 
is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to 
you.
Â 
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 
cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is 
concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, 
Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL 
ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

=============TESTIMONIALS===============
''My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a 
major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I 
grumbled to Jody about receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my 
knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody 
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. 
I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the 
thing didn't work. 
Â 
Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the 
next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00......... all cash! I was shocked. I have 
joined Jodyin her ''hobby''.

Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
=========================================
''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to 
participate in this plan. But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial investment was 
so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my 
money back. I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed 
with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 
Â 
The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply 
isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big''. 
Â 
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=========================================
''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given 
it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until 
I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came 
again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the 
money came within 22 weeks''. 
Â 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=========================================
''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I 
followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come 
in. My first month I made $20, in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of third 
month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet''.

In this IssueWELCOME to the Core JavaTM Technologies Tech Tips, September 10, 2002. Here you'll get tips on using core Java technologies and APIs, such as those in Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SETM).
Using ArrayList and LinkedListUsing Zero-Length Arrays
These tips were developed using Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v 1.4.
This issue of the JDC Tech Tips is written by Glen McCluskey.USING ARRAYLIST AND LINKEDLISTArrayList and LinkedList are two Collections classes used for storing lists of object references. For example, you could have an ArrayList of Strings, or a LinkedList of Integers. This tip compares the performance of ArrayList and LinkedList, and offers some suggestions about which of these classes is the right choice in a given situation.
The first key point is that an ArrayList is backed by a primitive Object array. Because of that, an ArrayList is much faster than a LinkedList for random access, that is, when accessing arbitrary list elements using the get method. Note that the get method is implemented for LinkedLists, but it requires a sequential scan from the front or back of the list. This scan is very slow. For a LinkedList, there's no fast way to access the Nth element of the list.
Consider the following example. Suppose you have a large list of sorted elements, either an ArrayList or a LinkedList. Suppose too that you do a binary search on the list. The standard binary search algorithm starts by checking the search key against the value in the middle of the list. If the middle value is too high, then the upper half of the list is eliminated. However, if the middle value is too low, then the lower half of the list is ignored. This process continues until the key is found in the list, or until the lower bound of the search becomes greater than the upper bound.
Here's a program that does a binary search on all the elements in an ArrayList or a LinkedList:
    import java.util.*;    public class ListDemo1 {
        static final int N = 10000;        static List values;        // make List of increasing Integer values        static {
           Integer vals[] = new Integer[N];           Random rn = new Random();           for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i < N; i++) {
               vals[i] = new Integer(currval);
               currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1;
           }           values = Arrays.asList(vals);
        }
        
        // iterate across a list and look up every
        // value in the list using binary search        static long timeList(List lst) {
            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {               // look up a value in the list 
               // using binary search               int indx = Collections.binarySearch(
                                   lst, values.get(i));               // sanity check for result 
               // of binary search               if (indx != i) {
                   System.out.println(
                                    ""*** error ***\n"");
               }
           }           return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
       }       public static void main(String args[]) {           // do lookups in an ArrayList            System.out.println(""time for ArrayList = "" +
               timeList(new ArrayList(values)));           // do lookups in a LinkedList           System.out.println(
               ""time for LinkedList = "" +
               timeList(new LinkedList(values)));
       }
    }
The ListDemo1 program sets up a List of sorted Integer values. It then adds the values to an ArrayList or a LinkedList. Then Collections.binarySearch is used to search for each value in the 
list.
When you run this program, you should see a result that looks something like this:
    time for ArrayList = 31    time for LinkedList = 4640
ArrayList is about 150 times faster than LinkedList. (Your results might differ depending on your machine characteristics, but you should see a distinct difference in the result for ArrayList as compared to that for LinkedList. The same is true for the other programs in this tip.) Clearly, LinkedList is a bad choice in this situation. The binary search algorithm inherently uses random access, and LinkedList does not support fast random access. The time to do a random access in a LinkedList is proportional to the size of the list. By comparison, random access in an ArrayList has a fixed time.
You can use the RandomAccess marker interface to check whether a List supports fast random access:
    void f(List lst) {
        if (lst instanceof RandomAccess) {
            // supports fast random access
        }
    }
ArrayList implements the RandomAccess interface, and LinkedList. does not. Note that Collections.binarySearch does take advantage of the RandomAccess property, to optimize searches.
Do these results prove that ArrayList is always a better choice? Not necessarily. There are many cases where LinkedList does better. Also note that there are many situations where an algorithm can be implemented efficiently for LinkedList. An example is reversing a LinkedList using Collections.reverse. The internal algorithm does this, and gets reasonable performance, by using forward and backward iterators.
Let's look at another example. Suppose you have a list of elements, and you do a lot of element inserting and deleting to the list. In this case, LinkedList is the better choice. To demonstrate that, consider the following ""worst case"" scenario. In this demo, a program repeatedly inserts elements at the beginning of a list. The code looks like this:
    import java.util.*;    public class ListDemo2 {
        static final int N = 50000;        // time how long it takes to add 
        // N objects to a list        static long timeList(List lst) {
            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();            Object obj = new Object();            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                lst.add(0, obj);
            }            return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
        }        public static void main(String args[]) {            // do timing for ArrayList            System.out.println(
                ""time for ArrayList = "" +
                timeList(new ArrayList()));            // do timing for LinkedList            System.out.println(
                ""time for LinkedList = "" +
                timeList(new LinkedList()));
        }
    } 
When you run this program, the result should look something like this:
    time for ArrayList = 4859    time for LinkedList = 125
These results are pretty much the reverse of the previous example.
When an element is added to the beginning of an ArrayList, all of the existing elements must be pushed back, which means a lot of expensive data movement and copying. By contrast, adding an element to the beginning of a LinkedList simply means allocating an internal record for the element and then adjusting a couple of links. Adding to the beginning of a LinkedList has fixed cost, but adding to the beginning of an ArrayList has a cost that's proportional to the list size.
So far, this tip has looked at speed issues, but what about space? Let's look at some internal details of how ArrayList and LinkedList are implemented in Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition v 1.4. These details are not part of the external specification of these classes, but are illustrative of how such classes work internally.
The LinkedList class has a private internal class defined like this:
    private static class Entry {
        Object element;
        Entry next;
        Entry previous;
    } 
Each Entry object references a list element, along with the next and previous elements in the LinkedList -- in other words, a doubly-linked list. A LinkedList of 1000 elements will have 1000 Entry objects linked together, referencing the actual list elements. There is significant space overhead in a LinkedList structure, given all these Entry objects.
An ArrayList has a backing Object array to store the elements. This array starts with a capacity of 10. When the array needs to grow, the new capacity is computed as:
    newCapacity = (oldCapacity * 3) / 2 + 1;
Notice that the array capacity grows each time by about 50%. This means that if you have an ArrayList with a large number of elements, there will be a significant amount of space wasted at the end. This waste is intrinsic to the way ArrayList works. If there was no spare capacity, the array would have to be reallocated for each new element, and performance would suffer dramatically. Changing the growth strategy to be more aggressive (such as doubling the size at each reallocation) would result in slightly better performance, but it would waste more space.
If you know how many elements will be in an ArrayList, you can specify the capacity to the constructor. You can also call the trimToSize method after the fact to reallocate the internal array. This gets rid of the wasted space.
So far, this discussion has assumed that either an ArrayList or a LinkedList is ""right"" for a given application. But sometimes, other choices make more sense. For example, consider the very common situation where you have a list of key/value pairs, and you would like to retrieve a value for a given key.
You could store the pairs in an N x 2 Object array. To find the right pair, you could do a sequential search on the key values. This approach works, and is a useful choice for very small lists (say 10 elements or less), but it doesn't scale to big lists.
Another approach is to sort the key/value pairs by ascending key value, store the result in a pair of ArrayLists, and then do a binary search on the keys list. This approach also works, and is very fast. Yet another approach is to not use a list structure at all, but instead use a map structure (hash table), in the form of a HashMap.
Which is faster, a binary search on an ArrayList, or a HashMap? Here's a final example that compares these two:
    import java.util.*;    public class ListDemo3 {
        static final int N = 500000;        // Lists of keys and values        static List keys;
        static List values;        // fill the keys list with ascending order key 
        // values and fill the values list with
        // corresponding values (-key)        static {
            Integer keyvec[] = new Integer[N];
            Integer valuevec[] = new Integer[N];            Random rn = new Random();            for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i < N; i++) {
                keyvec[i] = new Integer(currval);
                valuevec[i] = new Integer(-currval);
                currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1;
            }            keys = Arrays.asList(keyvec);
            values = Arrays.asList(valuevec);
        }        // fill a Map with key/value pairs        static Map map = new HashMap();        static {
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                map.put(keys.get(i), values.get(i));
            }
        }        // do binary search lookup of all keys        static long timeList() {
            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                int indx = Collections.binarySearch(
                                    keys, keys.get(i));                // sanity check of returned value 
                // from binary search                if (indx != i) {
                    System.out.println(
                                    ""*** error ***\n"");
                }
            }            return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
        }        // do Map lookup of all keys        static long timeMap() {
            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                Integer value = (Integer)map.get(
                                          keys.get(i));                // sanity check of value returned 
                // from map lookup                if (value != values.get(i)) {
                    System.out.println(
                                    ""*** error ***\n"");
                }
            }            return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
        }        public static void main(String args[]) {            // do timing for List implementation            System.out.println(""List time = "" + 
                                           timeList());            // do timing for Map implementation            System.out.println(""Map time = "" + 
                                            timeMap());
        }
    }
The program sets up Lists of keys and values, and then uses two different techniques to map keys to values. One approach uses a binary search on a list, the other a hash table.
When you run the ListDemo3 program, you should get a result that looks something like this:
    ArrayList time = 1000    HashMap time = 281
In this example, N has a value of 500000. Approximately, log2(N) - 1 comparisons are required in an average successful binary search, so each binary search lookup in the ArrayList will take about 18 comparisons. By contrast, a properly implemented hash table typically requires only 1-3 comparisons. So you should expect the hash table to be faster in this case.
However, binary search is still useful. For example, you might want to do a lookup in a sorted list and then find keys that are close in value to the key used for the lookup. Doing this is easy with binary search, but impossible in a hash table. Keys in a hash table are stored in apparent random order. Also, if you are concerned with worst-case performance, the binary search algorithm offers a much stronger performance guarantee than a hash table scheme. You might also consider using TreeMap for doing lookups in sorted collections of key/value pairs.
Let's summarize the key points presented in this tip:
Appending elements to the end of a list has a fixed averaged cost for both ArrayList and LinkedList. For ArrayList, appending typically involves setting an internal array location to the element reference, but occasionally results in the array being reallocated. For LinkedList, the cost is uniform and involves allocating an internal Entry object.
Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an ArrayList implies that the rest of the list must be moved. Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of a LinkedList has fixed cost.
A LinkedList does not support efficient random access
An ArrayList has space overhead in the form of reserve capacity at the end of the list. A LinkedList has significant space overhead per element.
Sometimes a Map structure is a better choice than a List.
For more information about Using ArrayList and LinkedLists, see section 16.6, List, and section 16.7, Map and SortedMap, in ""The JavaTM Programming Language Third Edition"" by Arnold, Gosling, and Holmes. Also see the Collections trail in the Java Tutorial, Third Edition.back to top
USING ZERO-LENGTH ARRAYSSuppose that you are writing a Java application that involves some sort of data filtering. You have some raw data that you want to clean up and process in various ways. One of the methods you've written takes an array of integers, along with minimum and maximum values. The method goes through the array and eliminates ""outliers,"" that is, values that are too small or too big. The result of the filtering process is a new array of cleaned-up data.
How could you implement this kind of filtering method? Here's one approach:
    import java.util.*;
    
    public class ZeroDemo1 {
    
        // filter input array and throw away values 
        // that are less than minval or greater than 
        // maxval
    
        static int[] filterData(
                int indata[], int minval, int maxval) {
    
            // check parameters for errors 
    
            if (indata == null) {
                throw new NullPointerException(
                                     ""indata is null"");
            }
            if (maxval < minval) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                ""maxval < minval"");
            }
    
            // count number of valid values 
            // in input array
    
            int validcnt = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < indata.length; i++) {
                if (indata[i] >= minval && indata[i] 
                                         <= maxval) {
                    validcnt++;
                }
            }
    
            // if no valid values, return null
    
            if (validcnt == 0) {
                return null;
            }
    
            // copy valid values to new array 
            // and return it
    
            int outdata[] = new int[validcnt];
            for (int i = 0, j = 0; 
                              i < indata.length; i++) {
                if (indata[i] >= minval && indata[i] 
                                           <= maxval) {
                    outdata[j++] = indata[i];
                }
            }
            return outdata;
        }
    
        public static void main(String args[]) {
    
            // set up test array of integers
    
            int indata[] = new int[]{1, 3, -17, 8, 59};
    
            // filter out values not in the range 1-10
    
            int outdata1[] = filterData(indata, 1, 10);
            for (int i = 0; i < outdata1.length; i++) {
                System.out.println(outdata1[i]);
            }
    
            // filter out values not 
            // in the range 100-200
    
            int outdata2[] = filterData(
                                     indata, 100, 200);
            for (int i = 0; i < outdata2.length; i++) {
                System.out.println(outdata2[i]);
            }
        }
    }
The filterData method does two scans of the input array. The first scan counts the number of valid data values. Then the method allocates a new array of the appropriate size, and copies the good values to it. If there are no good values, the method returns a null value for the array reference.
The result of running the ZeroDemo1 program is:
    1
    3
    8
    Exception in thread ""main""
    java.lang.NullPointerException
        at ZeroDemo1.main(ZeroDemo1.java:72)
The problem with this program is a rather basic one. The second call of filterData returns a null value, and the program fails to take this possibility into account.
A better approach in this example would be to comment out the block of code that tests for the possibility of no valid data values:
    /*
    if (validcnt == 0) {
        return null;
    }
    */
When there is no valid data, the code will fall through to the next line, where a zero-length array is allocated:
    int outdata[] = new int[0];
This is perfectly legal Java usage. The representation of Java arrays includes the length of the array, and it's therefore possible to tell if an array has zero length.
For the ZeroDemo1 example, if you anticipate that validcnt will often be zero, that is, data filtering will often eliminate all values from the input, then you could optimize away the second input scan by adding code like this:
    int outdata[] = new int[validcnt];
    if (validcnt == 0) {
        return outdata;
    }
Note that usage such as:
    int outdata[] = new int[]{};
is also legal, to initialize an array with a zero-length set of integer constants.
In general, it's best not to return null from a method that returns an array type. Always returning an array, even if the array has zero length, greatly improves the generality of algorithms. If you anticipate that your methods will often return zero-length arrays, you might be concerned about the performance implications of allocating many such arrays. In this case, you can allocate a single array, and always return the same one, as follows:
    private static final int ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAY[] = 
                                            new int[0];
This array is immutable (it can't be changed), and can be shared throughout your application.
There's another way that zero-length arrays are used, as illustrated in the following example:
    import java.util.*;
    
    public class ZeroDemo2 {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
    
            // set up ArrayList and add strings to it
    
            List stringlist = new ArrayList();
            stringlist.add(""string 1"");
            stringlist.add(""string 2"");
            stringlist.add(""string 3"");
    
            // convert to String array
    
            String out[] = (
                          String[])stringlist.toArray(
            new String[0]);
            for (int i = 0; i < out.length; i++) {
                System.out.println(out[i]);
            }
        }
    }
The result of running the ZeroDemo2 program is:
    string 1
    string 2
    string 3
The ZeroDemo2 program sets up an ArrayList, and adds three strings to it. Then the program calls toArray to get a String array of the three elements in the ArrayList. In this example, the argument to toArray is ""new String[0]"". This argument serves a couple of purposes. First, if you have a String array that's big enough to hold the elements of the ArrayList, you can specify it as the argument to toArray. The method will use the String array.
But if your array is not big enough, then the toArray method allocates an array to return the elements. It uses the type of the array that was passed in to determine the type of the allocated array. ArrayList stores its element references in an Object array. The toArray method needs to be told if there is some other type (such as String) to be used for returning the array of elements. The method uses reflection (java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance) to create an array of the appropriate type.

be exercising its First Amendment rights, just as much as it would be if it

refuse to publish or say what one doesn't like. The alternative is a 
state-controlled press that reprints government press releases and calls them 
news.The question of what is or is not FoRKed is (except for libel or other 
specific exceptions) not a matter of law, but a matter of what the 
""publisher"" (if any) decides or the ""community"" (if any) negotiates or does 
as a matter of custom.For my part, I'd rather people didn't use FoRK as a place in which to dump an 
expression of their political beliefs.Tom

"Hi,Thanks for the replies. It turns out that it was an IRQ conflict with an old 
sound card.Despite checking the BIOS and running the 3c509 setup utility on 
http://www.scyld.com/diag, the 2.4 kernel still picked a card on IRQ 5 and 10.It works fine now that the sound card is removed, but I'm still confused as to 
why this worked in 2.2.18 but not 2.4.19, seems like a regression to me...Thanks again,Cheers,

) . takeover speculation gave enron shares a boost wednesday , helping it end a 10 - day losing streak . but it ' s unlikely anyone is going to step into this mess before a securities and exchange commission investigation into its finances yields a few more answers . for investors , a short - term rally beyond the jump wednesday is still possible now that all of the big mutual funds have dumped the shares . but at a closing price of $ 13 . 90 , enron shares are more than a texas mile from their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 last december . for enron itself , it ' s time to put its cards on the table with regulators and wall street . as the drexel saga showed , a strategy of defiance to the end only hastens the end .",Safe Email

Fine - nobody can oblige SuSE to do anything other

Nobody can oblige them to give away anything
other than ftp - I'm not asking for that. I'm
asking for somebody who has Linux (GPL'ed) to
burn a copy for me and give it to me in exchange
for a reasonable consideration (say, the price of
the CDs and a bottle of Frascati or a couple of
pints?).
What does the GPL mean now?
I don't want their 60 days of free email support
or anything similar (if I did, I would pay for
it).

"8 - bit characters dear fellow linguists : in the past months i have read several postings to this list using languages other than english ( spanish , german , french , finnish , italian , etc . ) . i consider this situation absolutely delicious , as it adds that international flavour that our discipline is so proud of . as english is not my native tongue , i welcome and exercise my right to use my language in all contexts . however , the notorious difficulty that 8 - bit characters have to travel in the cyberspace has made it really hard to send texts that comply with the spelling conventions of these languages ( basically accented and umlauted vowels , greek letters and certain other symbols ) . this is not a big problem when you are just sending a relatively short e-message to a colleague who speaks the same language ( you just drop the accents and type plain vowels or capitals instead , for enye you type a plain "" n "" , etc . ) . the real trouble arises when you wish to send a more polished document such as a paper , an abstract , a conference posting , a bibliography , a draft of a thesis to a distant supervisor , etc . in most of these cases the spelling norms * are * crucial . the obvious solution is the coding of 8 - bit characters as sequences of 7 - bit characters . i think that this has become a common practice , but i do n't know whether there is a standard for these conversions . if this coding practice has not yet been the object of standardisation , i venture to propose one below . this proposal refers to the characters available in the extended character set on ibm pc - compatible computers ( i am not familiar with mac , but this could also be used in that system ) . i would like to stress the fact that it is not necessary to type the ( long ) document using the coding system , rather the file must typed as usual , with accented and umlauted vowels as well as the rest of the characters needed in the language , and just after that you make a copy of the file and on that copy you change the 8 - bit characters for 7 - bit sequences according to the table provided . this procedure is * not * manual , for this you use the search-and - replace facility normally available in your word processor or editor ( remember : the dos editor has it ) . this can be done for most languages in ten or fewer passes ( less than one minute , varying with the size of the file ) . it is important to let the recipient know that you have coded the file in this fashion . append a note at the beginnig of the document to that effect , with a suggestion to use the search-and - replace facility to make the reverse changes , as well as the table of changes and samples . feel free to edit ( and / or translate ) what follows if you wish to make the note shorter by including only what is pertinent for a given language . | a . model of a note :",Safe Email

The Philippines suffers from a Spanish-imposed aristocratic landowner
class, the same as in most of Latin America, with the serf-like
relationships that go with it.  You have multiple generations of
peasants/squatters that cultivate and live on the lands almost as a
human parts of the property package.The problem in the Philippines is that the landowner class is fading,
but the peasants are still operating under the old economic assumption
even though it isn't being imposed on them in most cases.  In a number
of areas, you have landowners that don't use their lands during bad
years (i.e. when sugar prices fall too low or some other condition that
makes planting unprofitable in the global economy) and in some cases
have all but abandoned them, but when they come back to plant crops
several years later they find the same peasants living on the fallow
land as scratch farmers to survive and waiting for the landowner to come
back and give them something to do.The government's solution to this was to ""redistribute"" fallow land to
the peasants that lived on them, and created a number of problems in the
process.  First of all, it meant that all the agricultural producers had
to plant crops all the time (profitable or not) or the government would
seize the land and give it to someone else, which is not economically
optimal by any means.  Second when they give it to the peasants, they
use it to become scratch farmers, which is not a particularly productive
economic activity, and the landowners generally let them do that for
free when the land is fallow anyway.  Third, the peasants generally
*prefer* to work for the landowner rather than own the land themselves;
they make more money, have more opportunities to become middle-class,
and enjoy a better lifestyle under that arrangement.  So the result of
all this is that the landowners either run an economically sub-optimal
agriculture business to protect their lands, or they risk having their
land seized without compensation and given to the peasants/squatters who
will gladly sell it back to the plantation owner rather than becoming
scratch farmers, another economically sub-optimal solution. The only
real role of the government in this arrangement is to be a drag on the
economy.And I don't know about 20 years for land titles in the Philippines.  It
takes a little longer than in the US (though not much), and you may have
to bribe someone to make it work well in an expedited manner, but it
isn't that onerous in the regions I'm familiar with.Speaking as a former Philippine plantation owner. (Yes, really. On
Negros and Cebu. Have I led a strange life or what?)-James Rogers

Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4 Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM. Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice, the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful - I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?

Hi,You can make $50,000 or more in the next 90 days sending e-mail.
Seem impossible? Is there a catch?  NO, there is no catch; just
send your e-mails and be on your way to financial freedom.Basically, I send out as many of these e-mails as I can, then
people send me CASH in the mail for information that I just e-mail
back to them. Everyday, I make a three minute drive to my P.O. Box
knowing that there are at least a few hundred dollars waiting for
me.  And the best part, IT IS COMPLETELY LEGAL.Just read the next few paragraphs and see what you think. If you
like what you read, great! If you don't, read it again because you
must have missed something.""AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TELEVISION""""Making over a half million dollars every 6 months from your home
for an investment of only $25 US dollars expense ONE TIME.  THANKS
TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET, BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS
WITHIN A YEAR!!!  Before you say, ""No Way!"" read the following.
This is the letter you've been reading about in the news lately.
Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a major
nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the
investigation of the program described below to see if it really
can make people money.The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.
Their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely
no laws prohibiting the participation in this program. This has
helped to show people that this is a simple, harmless, and fun way
to make some extra money at home.The results of this show have been truly remarkable. So many
people are participating that those involved are doing much better
than ever before. Since everyone makes more as more people try it
out, its been very exciting to be a part of it lately. You will
understand once you experience it.""HERE IT IS BELOW""*** Print This Now For Future Reference ***The following income opportunity is one you may be interested in
taking a look at. It can be started with VERY LITTLE investment
($25) and the income return is TREMENDOUS!!!THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY.It does not require you to come into contact with people, do any
hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave your house
except to get the mail.Simply follow the instructions, and you really can make this
happen. This e-mail order marketing program works every time if
you put in the effort to make it work. E-mail is the sales tool of
the future. Take advantage of this non-commercialized method of
advertising NOW!The longer you wait, the more savvy people will be taking your
business using e-mail. Get what is rightfully yours. Program
yourself for success and dare to think BIG. It sounds corny, but
it's true. You'll never make it big if you don't have this belief
system in place.MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.  It
is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford
Research and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50%
and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level
methods.
This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000
millionaires in the U.S., 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the
last several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show 45people
become millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing.You may have heard this story before, but Donald Trump made an
appearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he
would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch.
Without hesitating Trump said he would find a good network
marketing company and get to work.
The audience, started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the
audience and dead-panned his response. ""That's why I'm sitting up
here and you are all sitting out there!""With network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct
commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from
sales made by people you introduce to the business.Residual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing
time and money once, and getting paid again and again and again.
In network marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of
others.The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my
fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I reread everything and gave
some thought and study to it.My name is Jonathan Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I
worked at for the past twelve years down- sized and my position
was eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided to
open my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many
unforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, friends and
creditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my
business and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to
refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and
struggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened
in my life and I am writing to share that experience in hopes that
this will change your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!!In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's
prior to receiving this program, I had been sending away for
information on various business opportunities. All of the programs
I received, in my opinion were not cost effective. They were
either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial
investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work
or not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one
year. It didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it!But like I was saying, in December I received this program. I
didn't send for it, or ask for it; they just got my name off a
mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!!
After reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it
correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes.Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON.I could invest as much as I wanted to start without putting me
further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and figured it
out, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you I
was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal
aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office
(1-800-725-2161 24 hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed
legal! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN
LETTER, I decided ""WHY NOT.""Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my
time on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need
any money for printing to send out the program, and because all of
my orders are filled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am
telling you like it is. I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I
promised myself that I would not 'rip-off"" anyone, no matter how
much money it cost me.
Here is the basic version of what you need to do:Your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for Report #1
within 2 weeks of your first program going out. IF YOU DON'T, SEND
OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.Your second goal is to receive at least 150+ orders for Report #2
within 4 weeks. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.Once you have your 150 orders, relax, you've met your goal. You
will make $50,000+ but keep at it! If you don't get 150 right off,
keep at it! It may take some time for your down line to build.
Keep at it, stay focused, and do not let yourself get distracted.In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT
#1. I kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by January 13,
1 had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. My first step in making
$50,000 in 90 days was done.By January 30, 1 had received 196 orders for REPORT #2; 46 more
than I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. By March 1, of my
e-mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000 with more coming in every
day. I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car.
Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR
LIFE FOREVER!!  Remember, it won't work if you don't try it. This
program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the
rules of not trying to place your name in a different place. It
won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money!In order for this program to work very fast, try to meet your goal
of 20+ orders for Report #1, and 150+ orders for Report #2 and you
will make $50,000 or more in 90 days. If you don't reach the first
two goals with in four weeks, relax, you will still make a ton of
money, it may take a few months or so longer. But keep mailing out
the programs and stay focused! That's the key.  I AM LIVING PROOF
THAT IT WORKS!!! If you choose not to participate in this program,
I am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little cost or
risk to you. If you choose to participate, follow the program and
you will be on your way to financial security.If you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble
like I was, or you want to start your own business, consider this
a sign. I DID!  -Sincerely,  Jonathan RourkeP.S.  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look
like piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME!A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you
should have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal,
could not have been created by an amateur.Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable business
for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was
doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but
it wasn't working.Finally, I figured it out. It wasn't me; it was the economy.
Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had
been with us since 1945.I don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment
rate...because many of you know from first hand experience. There
were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before.The middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were
doing invested wisely and moved up. Those who did not including
those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down
into the ranks of the poor.As the saying goes, 'THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER.""
The traditional Methods of making money will never allow you to
""move up"" or ""get rich"". Inflation will see to that.You have just received information that can give you financial
freedom for the rest of your life, with ""NO RISK"" and ""JUST A
LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT."" You can make more money in the next few
months than you have ever imagined.Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any
way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a
copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of
the people you send this to may send out 50,000 ... and your name
will be on everyone of them!Remember though, the more you send out the more potential
customers you will reach.So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.  IT IS UP TO
YOU NOW!""THINK ABOUT IT."" Before you delete this program from your
mailbox, as I almost did, take a little time to read it and REALLY
THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when
YOU participate. Figure out the worst possible response and no
matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money!
You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you
have will vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS! -Jody
Jacobs, Richmond, VAHERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am
sure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days.Before you say ""No Way!"" please read this program carefully. This
is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making
opportunity. Basically, this is what you do:  As with all
multilevel businesses, we- build our business by recruiting new
partners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows
you to recruit new multilevel business partners, and we offer a
product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE
FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You
do it privately in your own home, store, or office.This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:
This is what you MUST do.1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below (You can't sell
them if you don't have them).* For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME &
RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem).*MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE - IN CASE OF
ANY MAIL PROBLEMS!* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five
reports. You need all five reports so that you can save them on
your computer and resell them.* Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five
reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for
you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.2. IMPORTANT- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed
next to each report, or their order
on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps ""a""
through 'g"" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.
Once you understand the way this works you'll also see how it
doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has been
tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.a. Look below for the listing of available reports.b. After you've ordered the. five reports, take this Advertisement
and remove the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has
made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000!c. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5.d. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.e. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3f. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.g. Insert your name and address in the REPORT #1 position.Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! Copy
and paste method works well,.3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names,
and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the Instruction
portion of this letter.Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely
you can afford $25). You obviously already have an Internet
Connection and e-mail is FREE!To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5
reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing
information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find
thousands of free classified ads and much, much more.Here are two primary methods of building your downline:METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAILLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,
and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000
programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5%
response. Using a good list, the response could be much better.
Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs
instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you send out
only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders
for REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000
programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people
respond and order REPORT #2.Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The
0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000
send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. The 0.5%
response to that is I 0,000 orders for REPORT #4. That amounts to
10,000 each of $5 bills for you in CASH MONEY! Then think about
level five!  That's $500,000 alone!Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000+ $50,000
+ $500,000 for a total of $555,550!!!REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE
YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM!
DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF
SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many
people will do just that and more!REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, and
e-mail software.METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET1. Advertising on the Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are
HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to
start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to
get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. Placing a
lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response.
Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10
downline members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING
results below:1st level-your 10 members with $5 ....... $50
2nd level-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) ....... $500
3rd level-10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000).......  $5,000
4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10k) .......  $50,000
5th level-10 members from those 10,000 ($5 x 100k) .......  $500,000THIS TOTALS     -      $555,550Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate
only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen
if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of
participants.THINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is
e-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE
SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the
e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be
prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report!AVAILABLE REPORTS         *** Order Each REPORT by NUMBER, AND
NAME **** ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) FOR EACH REPORT. CHECKS NOT
ACCEPTED * - ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL - Make
sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets
of paper (SO THAT THE BILL CAN'T BE SEEN AGAINST LIGHT)  On one of
those sheets of paper include:
(a) the number & name of the report you are ordering,
(b) your e-mail address, and
(c) your name & postal address (in case your e-mail provider
encounters problems).PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:REPORT #1 ""The Insiders Guide to Advertising for Free on the Internet""ORDER REPORT #1 FROM:Tony Goon

the directions accurately.* Send for the five reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when
the orders start coming in. When you receive a $5 order, you MUST
send out the requested product/report.* ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.* Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the
instructions exactly, your results WILL BE SUCCESSFUL!* ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES *******Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:Start posting ads as soon as you mail off for the reports! By the
time you start receiving orders, your reports will be in your
mailbox! For now, something simple, such as posting on message
boards something to the effect of ""Would you like to know how to
earn $50,000 working out of your house with NO initial investment?
Email me with the keywords ""more info"" to find out how. And, when
they email you, send them this report in response!If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks,
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100
orders for REPORT#2. If you don't, continue advertising or sending
e-mails until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders
for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already
working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in!THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down
on the list you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. You can
KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are
ordering from you. If you want to generate more income, send
another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the
whole process again! There is no limit to the income you will
generate from this business!Before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate

WORLD!5. YOUR ONLY EXPENSES OTHER THAN YOUR INITIAL $25 INVESTMENT IS
YOUR TIME!6. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE INCOME YOU GENERATE FROM THIS PROGRAM IS
PURE PROFIT!7. THIS PROGRAM WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER.******* TESTIMONIALS*******This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially
the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position,
it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income. I'm
living proof that it works. It really is a great opportunity to
make relatively easy money, with little cost to you. If you do
choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be
on your way to financial security. -Steven Bardfield, Portland, ORMy name is Mitchell.  My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I
am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make
pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Jody
about receiving ""junk mail."" I made fun of the whole thing,
spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.
I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed
intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of
her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the
thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks
she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had
received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that
I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a believer
now. I have joined Jody in her ""hobby. "" I did have seven more
years until retirement, but I think of the 'rat race,' and it's
not for me. We owe it all to MLM. -Mitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL.The. main reason for this letter is to convince you that this
system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to
get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached
several times before 1 checked this out. I joined just to see what
one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money
required. To my astonishment I received $36,470.00 in the first 14
weeks, with money still coming in.
-Charles Morris, Esq.Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up
my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I
decided that the initial investment was so little that there was
just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my
money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium- size post
office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded
that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make
more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice
thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live.
There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.
-Paige Willis, Des Moines, IAI had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I
wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I
was e-mailed another program ... 11 months passed then it came ...
I didn't delete this one! ... I made. more than $41,000 on the
first try!!  -Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PAThis is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit
our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the
interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will
work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's
sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck and happy
spending!  -Kerry Ford, Centerport, NYIT IS UP TO YOU NOW!  Take 5 minutes to Change Your Future!ORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR ROAD TO FINANCIAL

Irvine CA 92606July 24, 2002
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEGOVERNMENT REGULATION IS KILLING THE STOCK MARKET       IRVINE, CA -- The steep decline in the stock market is being fueled
by investors' realization that increasing government constraints on
corporate America will harm business and the economy--not help them, said
Yaron Brook, executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute.       ""Instead of launching a witch-hunt against CEOs and rushing to give
the government wider powers over business, we should get rid of the complex
and contradictory regulations that encourage bad accounting and prevent
shareholders from acting in their own interest.""       ""The common explanation that 'greed' is to blame makes no sense--the
abuses in companies like Enron and WorldCom were not exercises in
self-interest, but in self-destruction.       ""In an unfettered free market the desire for profit is satisfied by
honest, long-range, rational behavior: by innovating, by hiring the best
employees, by selling quality products and by providing accurate information
to the owners of the corporation--the shareholders. As for short-range
managers, the markets will not tolerate them. As for the real swindlers,
existing laws against force and fraud are sufficient to protect us.""       ""If our politicians are indeed concerned about the stock market,""
said Dr. Brook, ""let them demonstrate it by eliminating, not adding,
regulations and making the market truly free.""###   ###   ###Ayn Rand Institute executive director Dr. Yaron Brook is available for
interviews on this topic.Contact: Larry Benson

which is the same thing) that we don't handle outages of network
services better.The rule is useful and it does help reduce spam, we should keep it.  I
have a feeling the DNSBL rules will cluster a bit more heavily around
the 1.0 to 2.0 range once we start using the new GA on them.Also, 0.77 was a slightly conservative number.  Since I didn't have
real-time data, I typically used the lower or median number of different
periods (most recent month, two months, six months), depending on the
trend of the period data (better performance for recent messages ->
favor recent scores, worse performance for recent messages -> favor
lowest scores, never pick the highest number unless the rule was very
accurate and the highest number was for the most recent data).Dan

Date: 2002-10-09T19:54:41-05:00Actually, 5.6. I clocked my â€œlong loopâ€ today and discovered that 
the run I thought was 6 miles is actually only 5.6. And the â€œshort 
loopâ€ I thought was 5 miles is actually only 4.6. I have an off-by-0.4 
bug. This is very upsetting. I've lost 0.4 miles somewhere. If anyone finds 
them, can you please let me know? Thank you. I ran 9 miles last week, and 10 so far this week, even taking into account my 
off-by-0.4 bug. I fear I am turning into a runner. My father and I made fun of 
runners when I was growing up. He used to say that you never saw a runner 
smiling. We'd drive by runners, point at them, and say, â€œLook, another 
runner... not smiling!â€ This weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative 
years. So it is with some measure of shame that I admit that I am becoming a 
runner. Becoming a runner is actually not that difficult. Not surprisingly, it involves 
running. There's other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important 
part. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, 
run around the block. Tomorrow you'll run around the block, and the next day 
you'll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you'll find you can 
run a mile. Then one day you'll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, 
then get invigorated and run another mile. And then you're a runner. That's it, really. It's not complicated. You run, and 
you run, and you run. And one day, you discover that shoes are important, and 
that the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running 
thing out aren't actually very good for running. So you go buy new shoes, and 
you run, and you run, and you run. And later, you discover that stretching is 
important too, so you stretch and run, and stretch and run, and stretch and 
run. There's other stuff too, but it doesn't really matter until you're already a 
runner. You learn about differences in running surfaces. And how many miles you 
should really put on one pair of shoes. And when in the day you should run to 
maximize calorie burning. And how to train for a marathon, and so forth. Don't 
worry about any of that now. Just run. Running is key. Otherwise you're just 
another fat schmuck lying on the couch reading _Runner's World_.",Safe Email

On 2.2 it loads to IRQ 10.Anyone got any suggestions on what to do here? Its a debian 3.0 distro. This works fine when booted to 2.2 so the hardware/BIOS etc seem ok, so it seems to be 2.4 spacific.

"enron mentions blowback forbes , 11 - 12 - 01 enron shares rise , rebounding from nine - year low ( updatel ) 2001 - 10 - 31 11 : 56 ( new york ) enron shares rise as analysts cite bargain - hunting , financing speculation dow jones business news , 10 / 31 / 01 enron trades higher after heavy losses cbs . marketwatch . com , 10 / 31 / 01 usa : u . s . tech stocks up , blue chips shed gains . reuters english news service , 10 / 31 / 01 us west pwr lower on new - month positions despite gas rise dow jones energy service , 10 / 31 / 01 uk : enron close to exiting indian lng shipping deal . reuters english news service , 10 / 31 / 01 mariner energy to sell stake in aconcagua field for $ 51 million bloomberg , 10 / 31 / 01 blowback daniel fisher , forbes magazine , 11 . 12 . 01 did enron use partnerships to artificially boost earnings ? lawyers are rubbing their hands . if the truth sets you free , the top echelon at enron corp . , present and past , should be feeling positively footloose these days . just in time to get shackled by a slew of shareholder suits . private securities lawyers and the securities & exchange commission are looking into the houston energy trading firm ' s complex relationships with outside partnerships it used to hedge against fluctuations in the value of its investments . where enron sees 21 st - century financial engineering , lawyers see possible earnings inflation . ( chairman kenneth lay says enron is cooperating with the sec inquiry . ) one partnership , run by enron chief financial officer andrew fastow , added $ 236 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2001 , boosting enron ' s $ 425 million in net income in that period . the partnership ' s contribution plunged to $ 5 million in the second quarter ended june 30 , but investors only found out aug . 14 - - when enron filed its quarterly 10 - q with the sec . oddly enough , that was the day chief executive jeffrey skilling unexpectedly resigned . expect class - action lawyers to go after the profits skilling and other insiders made by selling $ 660 million in stock when shares were flying high . ( they ' re down 78 % from august 2000 . ) since skilling left , enron has taken a $ 1 . 2 billion hit to shareholders ' equity to unwind partnerships . "" they certainly misled the market as to the size of [ partnership losses ] , "" says thomas shapiro , one of several lawyers filing shareholder suits against enron . who knows what will emerge from some of the other partnerships ? enron shares rise , rebounding from nine - year low ( updatel ) 2001 - 10 - 31 11 : 56 ( new york ) enron shares rise , rebounding from nine - year low ( updatel ) ( adds analyst comment in sixth paragraph . ) houston , oct . 31 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . shares rose as much as 19 percent , one day after falling to their lowest level in more than nine years , amid speculation the company may be a takeover target . shares of the top energy trader rose $ 1 . 58 , or 14 percent , to $ 12 . 74 in midday trading of 19 . 9 million shares , compared with the three - month daily average of 10 . 4 million shares . earlier , the shares hit $ 13 . 25 . shares of houston - based enron have fallen 84 percent this year . they have lost more than half their value this month amid a u . s . securities and exchange commission inquiry into partnerships headed by andrew fastow , enron ' s former chief financial officer . fastow was ousted last week in an attempt to restore confidence in the stock . ` ` there are rumors out there that they are a potential takeover target , but i think it ' s very unlikely that anyone will buy them out at this point , ' ' said zach wagner , an analyst at edward jones & co . ` ` there are too many uncertainties . ' ' enron is more likely to get a large cash infusion from an investor , wagner said . he has a ` ` reduce ' ' rating on enron shares . he doesn ' t own the stock . the wall street journal today said general electric co . ' s ge capital , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway inc . and royal dutch petroleum co . are ` ` among the names bandied about ' ' as potential buyers for all or part of enron . - - margot habiby in the dallas newsroom ( 214 ) 954 - 9452 enron shares rise as analysts cite bargain - hunting , financing speculation by christina cheddar 10 / 31 / 2001 dow jones business news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) dow jones newswires new york - - after losing nearly two - thirds of their value over the past two weeks , enron corp . shares regained some lost ground wednesday . bargain - hunting and speculation were said to be behind the buying , with some suggesting that enron is nearing a deal for additional financing , while others are said to be mulling the possibility the company may be acquired . in afternoon trading on new york stock exchange , enron shares ( ene ) were up $ 1 . 49 , or 13 % , to $ 12 . 65 on volume of 24 . 9 million shares . earlier , the stock traded as high as $ 13 . 25 . enron , which typically trades an average of 10 million shares a day , was again one of the most actively traded stocks on the big board . on tuesday , enron shares set a 52 - week low of $ 10 . 90 , which was the stock ' s lowest level in a decade . commerzbank securities analyst andre meade attributed the jump in enron ' s stock to investors attracted by its low price . those buyers , he said , are hoping not to be hit by the "" double swords "" hanging over the houston energy trader - - a securities and exchange commission investigation of the financial dealings of its former chief financial officer andrew fastow , with an off - balance sheet financing vehicle and the possibility of another credit - rating downgrade by moody ' s , which could trigger the need to issue additional stock and thereby dilute the holdings of existing investors . in addition , there is speculation "" through the houston circuit "" that enron may be close to securing additional financing , said prudential securities analyst carol coale . if the speculation proves true , the financing would help enron to shore up its financial condition and improve confidence among investors as well as its business partners . investors also may be placing their bets on the belief that enron shares have eroded enough in value to make the company a takeover candidate . a report in the wall street journal wednesday said several companies including general electric co . ' s ( ge ) ge capital unit , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway inc . ( brka , brkb ) and royal dutch / shell group ( rd ) have been named as potential buyers for enron . ms . coale said the takeover speculation was "" unwarranted "" and has surfaced each time enron shares faltered . "" it would be very unusual . . . for a company to be interested in a takeover ( of enron ) given the uncertainty of the sec inquiry . why add that uncertainty to your portfolio ? "" she said . furthermore , ms . coale said , it might be difficult for a company such as shell to clear regulatory hurdles because it already operates a substantial energy trading business . commerzbank ' s mr . meade also discounted the takeover speculation . he likened such a deal to the acquisition of a financial - service company . "" you are buying a human - capital - based business . you have to make sure you ' re not going to loose all your people , "" he said . "" it ' s a trickier acquisition . "" but not everyone thinks the takeover speculation is implausible . roger hamilton , an analyst at john hancock value funds , said shell and enron are "" neighbors "" , and shell has looked at enron "" on and off . "" still , he said that if there is a buyer for enron , the company would want to do it sooner rather than later in order not to risk damaging enron ' s leading market position . some marketwatchers said at least some of the pressure on enron shares in recent trading sessions has come from mutual funds liquidating their positions to avoid having the company ' s name appear among their holdings in their annual reports . despite the rise in enron shares wednesday , there remains a significant amount of uncertainty about the stock . in addition to the pending sec inquiry and the lingering credit concerns , attention also is being paid to their effect on enron ' s trading business . while several trading counterparties have said that they are watching the situation closely , at least one , entergy corp . ( etr ) , is said to be trimming its exposure to enron . the new york mercantile exchange also plans to use enron ' s weakness to recapture part of the over - the - counter energy derivative market by offering its own clearing services and trading tools for the natural gas market . write to christina cheddar at christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron trades higher after heavy losses by lisa sanders , cbs . marketwatch . com last update : 1 : 27 pm et oct . 31 , 2001 houston ( cbs . mw ) - - shares of enron , which had lost about 66 percent of their value over the past 10 sessions , spiked in wednesday trading after a report that pegged the beleaguered company as a takeover target . enron ( ene : news , chart , profile ) added 13 percent , or $ 1 . 46 , to $ 12 . 62 in recent dealings . volume was heavy at 25 million shares . john olson , an analyst at sanders morris harris in houston , pointed out that the heavy losses enron sustained over the last 10 sessions partly reflects the end of the tax year for mutual funds . the calendar year for funds ends at the close of business wednesday . "" mutual funds who own enron stock have been trying to offset other gains by selling off enron , "" he said . "" mutual funds have to register all their gains or losses and offset them by selling or buying stock by the close today . "" a wall street journal report wednesday speculated on enron ' s potential as an acquisition for a more stable company . enron has been under pressure for more than two weeks , beginning when the energy merchant reported a $ 1 billion charge in its third - quarter earnings . a securities and exchange commission probe into two of the company ' s limited partnerships and a rating downgrade by moody ' s investors service haven ' t helped . olson said he thought an enron takeover unlikely at this point . "" however , if the stock were to keep coming down , and their financial difficulties were extended , the odds would increase , "" he said . art smith , chairman and chief executive of the research firm john s . herold , said he ' d be surprised if enron was not entertaining offers . "" it ' s one of the ways that enron gets the genie back in the bottle . "" on the other hand , smith said , it would take a potential acquirer time to become comfortable with the valuation of the business . "" it ' s doubtful that a potential acquirer can resolve all the valuation issues quickly , "" smith said . he said it ' s likely that any sort of purchase agreement would contain what he called a "" look - back provision , "" which would protect the acquirer from being strapped to a fixed value . smith said he could see either general electric ' s ( ge : news , chart , profile ) ge capital or royal dutch shell ( rd : news , chart , profile ) making a bid . both were mentioned in the journal report . "" ge capital is big enough that if it didn ' t work out it won ' t cripple ge , and they ' ve been opportunistic on things like this , "" smith said . "" and shell always keeps us guessing . "" olson also included aig ( aig : news , chart , profile ) and citigroup ( c : news , chart , profile ) as potential acquirers . "" enron has certainly had some appeal to people that are used to an aggressive trading culture , "" he said . smith said that even without enron , the energy marketing and trading business would continue to thrive . "" even if enron went away , it would not change what has developed into a healthy market for commodity forward markets and hedging , "" he said . lisa sanders is a dallas - based reporter for cbs . marketwatch . com . usa : u . s . tech stocks up , blue chips shed gains . by haitham haddadin 10 / 31 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . new york , oct 31 ( reuters ) - technology stocks held gains in early afternoon trading on wednesday after the u . s . economy shrank less than wall street feared in the third quarter , but blue chips dipped as an early rally faded on worries the worst is yet to come . "" you will need a lot of fortitude to see the mountaintop when we are in the depths of the valley , "" said jay mueller , economist and portfolio manager at strong capital management inc . , which oversees $ 42 billion . the economy suffered its worst contraction since the first quarter of 1991 , the government said in its "" advance "" or early estimate of gross domestic product . gdp , the broadest measure of u . s . economic health , shrank 0 . 4 percent in the third quarter . the number still managed to beat economists ' projected 1 percent drop and helped spark an early rally . wall street still faces a heavy economic calendar this week and is girding for readings on the manufacturing sector and job market . some economists expect the u . s . economy will give an even worse performance in the fourth quarter as the sept . 11 attacks haunt the nation . the technology - laced nasdaq composite index advanced 28 . 65 points , or 1 . 72 percent , to 1 , 696 . 06 , after snagging a gain of more than 3 percent earlier in the day . sun microsystems inc . jumped 77 cents to $ 10 . 31 , or 8 percent , after the network computer maker said orders were tracking higher this quarter than they were this time last quarter . the dow jones industrial average was off 6 . 23 points , or 0 . 07 percent , at 9 , 115 . 75 , after climbing more than 1 percent . eastman kodak co . , down $ 2 . 69 to $ 25 . 11 , or 9 . 7 percent , pressured the blue - chip gauge after moody ' s cut its debt rating and warned it may lower the long - term rating again amid falling profits . the broader standard & poor ' s 500 index rose 4 . 03 points , or 0 . 38 percent , at 1 , 063 . 82 . the stock market had sold off in the last two days after rallying last week . wall street widely expects the economy to slip into a recession . but investors are hoping more tax cuts and lower interest rates will lift the economy by 2002 . president george w . bush urged congress to pass a stimulus package by the end of november in a speech at the white house . most economists expect the economic contraction to last at least to the end of the year and if it does , the third quarter would mark the start of the first u . s . recession in 10 years . a recession is loosely defined as at least two straight quarters of falling gdp . in other economic news , the national association of purchasing management - chicago said its october index slipped to 46 . 2 from 46 . 6 in september , but this beat economists ' estimates of a drop to 43 . 0 . the october index that showed less weakness than expected suggests regional manufacturing could bottom fairly soon , but does not necessarily mean thursday ' s national survey by napm will follow suit , analysts said .

"tilburg conference on ot call for papers tilburg university conference on the derivational residue in phonology 1 - 7 october 1995 the grammatical models group of tilburg university plans to organize a conference on the derivational residue in phonology . in this conference we hope to discuss all topics which were dealt with in standard generative phonology by derivational means such as level ordering , ( strict ) cyclicity and rule ordering , in the light of the recent shift of attention towards theories that are more representational in nature . can all the derivational tools mentioned be replaced by representational instruments ? if they can , what should the ` optimal ' representational theory look like ? if they cannot , what exactly is the residue of derivationalism that we still need ? we invite all papers with these or related topics ( a more complete description of the conference topic can be found below ) both for and against purely representational approaches to phonology . we expect to be able to ( partially ) reimburse travelling expenses and lodging for our speakers . furthermore we are proud that bruce hayes and geert booij have already agreed to be our invited speakers . deadline those interested in presenting a paper ( 40 minutes talks , 15 minutes discussion ) should send 5 copies of a two page abstract ( 10 anonymous ; 1 camera-ready , with name ( s ) , affiliation ( s ) and contact address , including e-mail ) to : marc van oostendorp or ben hermans , grammaticamodellen , tilburg university , postbus 90153 , 5000 le , tilburg , the netherlands . abstracts must be received by 1 may 1995 . abstracts with page text considered too condensed to be read will be rejected without review . no email submissions accepted . for additional information contact b . j . h . hermans @ kub . nl or m . voostendorp @ kub . nl . topic of the conference during the past few years the main focus of attention in phonology seems to have been shifted from derivational to representational models , such as prince and smolensky 's optimality theory , goldsmith 's harmonic phonology and burzio 's pes - model . yet generative phonologists have accumulated substantial evidence for derivational analysis . in standard lexical phonology , for instance , derivationalism plays a role in several ways : the model is divided into a lexical and a postlexical component , the lexical component itself is divided into several lexical levels , some lexical levels are cyclic and every affix starts its own cycle and , finally , the phonologicals rule within every cycle are ordered . the question is how we have to evaluate all these derivational instruments in a representational theory of phonology . the distinction between lexical and postlexical phonology seems to be least controversial . most optimality theory analyses seem to accept at least this remnant of derivationalism . yet one could imagine a more radical version of a purely representational theory in which the distinction between word-level and phrasal phonology is accounted for in an appropriate theory of phonological domains . in any case , the question remains as to how we have to evaluate the traditional criteria for lexical-postlexical distinction ( exceptions , sensitivity to morphological and syntactic boundaries , etc . ) in a theory of constraints and constraint ranking . similar questions could be asked about the internal level ordering within the lexical component . can all analyses which used to be framed in terms of lexical levels be reframed in representational terms ? and to what extent can a theory which makes extensive use of lexical levels still be called ` representational ' ? most discussion on derivationalism within optimality theory seems to have been concentrated on the issue of cyclicity . it has been demonstrated that some cyclic analyses can be replaced by an adequate theory of alignment between phonological and morphological structure . is this everything that needs to be said about this issue ? are , for instance , cyclic versions of ot feasible and desirable ? similarily , considerable effort has been put by several researchers into showing that strict cyclicity as a theoretical concept is superfluous or that it can be replaced by a theory of underspecification . whether this is an adequate answer to all derived environment effects is another topic we hope to address . finally , we expect that even at the finest grained level of derivationalism , viz . phonological rule ordering ( both intrinsic and extrinsic ) interesting questions remain unanswered . in particular all cases of what used to be known as counter-feeding and counter-bleeding relations seem to us still to be open for discussion . all of these questions have considerable conceptual import , yet it seems to us that they can ultimately be answered empirically . the issue of derivationalism is one of the interesting challenges that optimality theory and the other models mentioned earlier pose . we hope to receive many abstracts dealing with it .",Safe Email
"Hi,I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.Well, grasshopper, think again ...It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  It's that simple ...All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.Here goes ...Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay

Lennon killer seeks parole againThe man who shot dead former Beatle John Lennon is making another bid for
early release from prison - the day before what would have been Lennon's
62nd birthday.
Mark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the
superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980.
It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from
Attica state prison.
At a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and
had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the
ex-Beatle.
Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star.
Shot dead
Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New
York City apartment on 8 December 1980.
He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session
during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice.
Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from
Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as
Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him.
The killer said Lennon had been just ""a picture on an album cover"" to him
before the shooting.
'Deserved death'
Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his
crime.
Lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if
Chapman were released.
Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the
Liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled
commercial success.
The Beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would
have been 62 on Wednesday.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

"from http://www.arstechnica.com/""There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Department
of Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against
individuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted
material over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes
that ""criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to
preserve the viability of America's content industries."" Malcolm also
believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are
participating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download
copyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions
such as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see
businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of
copyrighted works.
""Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think
they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal
prosecution,"" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same
conference panel.I'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is
hoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or
warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor
deterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits
carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate
further animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to
initiate because of the ""schooling"" effect of millions of systems
participating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from
the crowd.The article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines
illegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:
Criminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for
purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the
reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any
180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more
copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....
For purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution
of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish
willful infringement.
...
The term ""financial gain"" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of
anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.
Therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as ""financial gain""
even if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the
value of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15
to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the
perspective of the consumer or copyright holder.The statute of limitations:
507. Limitations on actions(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained
under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five
years after the cause of action arose.(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the
provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after
the claim accrued.The penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in
Section 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time
criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.I'm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to
prosecute because of the aforementioned ""schooling"" effect, but my guess
would be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent
individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be
targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers. Thanks to
MonaLisaOverdrive for pointing out this story.

"it was my understanding that they had the food before they refused to pay. I often have the goods in my possession before I settle the paycheck.Second, 'not being paid for a little food' is an awfully big deal in India. It isn't far from stealing the only food my children have so I'll have to watch them starve. The margin of survival is very, very, thin.So yes. In my particular reality distortion field 'not paying for a little food' in India is akin to a direct act of violence intended to cause suffering if not death on the victims family. That such an act triggers a violent response is, IMHO, hardly surprising.In other words, as far as I could tell the people on the train fired the first shot.With all of that said I still don't know if this happened or not.

"british < a > having followed the discussion of [ ae ] vs .

option, one I hadn't seen much of, before.  Look as if OnStream (spun
off from Philips Electronics in 1998) invented and rather tightly
control the format, though other companies such as Verbatim do make
compatible media under licence.If you're reasonably serious about backup, you need to plan for a
rotational backup scheme and retirement of tapes as they become worn
(and well before they start failing).  That requires at least a couple
of dozen tapes for the first couple of years.  Therefore, cost and
availability of media are (or should be) a major factor.  Also, tape
heads wear out and need to be replaced (more rapidly for helical-scan
systems -- which ADR turns out _not_ to be), and somehow that always
ends up being cheaper for tape technologies in which there is heavy
competition.The less-tangible consideration that comes most immediately to mind is
that, if one's OnStream ADR drive fails, the only possible replacement
that would suffice to restore your accumulated backup sets is another 
OnStream ADR drive.  In that sense, you're somewhat locked in:  I'm 
not seeing ADR drives from anyone else (though I might have missed
them).  If OnStream are smart, they've priced the drives to attract people into
the system, and are making up the shortfall on media cost after they 
get people to buy in.   I see the following prices for mail order 
(http://www.finnsoft.com/priclist/verbat.htm) of Verbatim-brand tapes:42 euros for 30 GB ADR tape
33 euros for 30 GB ADR tape, four-pack.
66 euros for 50 GB ADR tape.
44 euros for 50 GB ADR tape, four-pack.
47 euros for ADR cleaning tape.(You don't get much lower pricing than Verbatim, without going no-name.)Capacities are usually quoted on the basis of a nominal 2:1 compression
ratio.  The PDF datasheet for Onstream's ""ADR2"" series says this is a
linear-serpentine recording technology (a good thing) like DLT, SDLT,
and LTO, rather than a helical-scan method typified by DDS/DAT, AIT, and
8mm (which puts heavy wear on tapes on heads).I'm not sure what software other than NovaStor's TapeCopy and Yosemite
Technology's Tapeware will support OnStream's drives.  My recollection
is that BRU will do it.On balance, I'd personally _still_ go with a DDS4 drive using either DDS3
or DDS4 media, mostly because once you've survived life with one
oddball, less-standard tape format, you're not in a hurry to repeat the
experience.  But ADR does seem at a quick glance to be well designed,
and might be a good bet after all.  As they say in the gaming industry,
""Ya pays your money, and ya takes your chances.""--

 Hitler-style applicant welcomed by parties
 By Roger Boyes
 
 
 
 MANAGERS of GermanyÂ’s political parties are having difficulty explaining their
 enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed
 largely from Mein Kampf, HitlerÂ’s personal manifesto. The incident illustrates
 how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an
 election campaign, even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to
 those of the FÃ¼hrer. 
 
 Â“Edmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the
 present Chancellor,Â” said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union
 headquarters in Ingolstadt. Â“Chancellor SchrÃ¶der is doing nothing to stop the
 flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland,Â” said the letter,
 signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald. 
 
 The CSU immediately spotted a potential member. Â“Many thanks for your nice
 thoughts,Â” replied the local party manager, who enclosed an application for
 membership. 
 
 The letter used chunks of HitlerÂ’s book, which is still banned in Germany.
 History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries.
 
 
 Â“The strongest, the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of
 existence, only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive,Â”
 the letter-writer said. Â“So-called humanity is melting like snow in the March
 sun.Â” Such phrases were lifted from Mein Kampf, which was written while Hitler
 was in jail after the failed Munich putsch of 1923. 
 
 Similar letters, also using the Nazi leaderÂ’s words, were sent to the other
 political parties and drew sympathetic responses. Â“I read your letter with
 great interest and pleasure,Â” the manager of the Christian Democratic Union in
 Cologne, said. 
 
 Â“Great that you want to join us!Â” enthused the Green Party headquarters. The
 Free Democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball
 at which Hans- Dietrich Genscher, the former Foreign Minister, would be the
 star guest. The Social Democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by
 Gerhard SchrÃ¶der, the Chancellor. 
 
 Â“I wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right-wing
 extremism,Â” said the letter-writer, who was in fact the Cologne novelist
 Rainer Popp. Â“I had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic. 
 
 Â“For the first few days I expected two men in leather coats from the Special
 Branch to knock on my door. Instead only the postman called Â— with packets of
 election material from zealous political headquarters,Â” Herr Popp said. 
 
 Â“I was stunned that political parties could react in this way Â— I reckon I
 would have had the same response if I had signed the letter Â‘Adolf HitlerÂ’.Â”

"comparative method in syntax fritz newmeyer asks if it is legitimate to apply the comparative method in syntax . my answer is yes , but it is more difficult . the main reason why one sees more work on historical-comparative syntax than fifty years ago is that syntax has become much more prestigious in recent decades . i do n't think that there was a shift from a once "" standard "" view that syntactic reconstruction is impossible . bernhard delbrueck 's historical-comparative syntax of indo - european , published a hundred years ago , clearly showed that comparative syntax is both possible and fruitful , but perhaps too difficult to attract many followers . the view that historical-comparative syntax is impossible was defended in some detail in lightfoot 's ( 1979 ) principles of diachronic syntax , but few researchers seem to have been discouraged by lightfoot 's attitude . it is true that latin syntax could hardly be reconstructed from modern romance languages , but neither could latin morphology , and even the view of latin phonology that we would get from romance is very distorted . our reconstruction of protolanguage grammar is always imperfect , but that is no reason not to attempt reconstruction . the main error on lightfoot 's side is that there is no syntactic analog to the regularity of sound change . it 's just a bit more complicated in syntax - - just like syntax is more complicated overall than phonology . basically , the analog to phonemes and words are words and sentences . true , the difference between words and sentences is that in general sentences are not stored in the lexicon . but neither are many complex words ( rendering morphological reconstruction similarly difficult , but nobody seems ever to have objected to morphological reconstruction ) , and some sentences are actually stored , e . g . proverbs and idioms , which often show syntactic archaisms . and since earlier syntax often survives in "" fossilized "" form in later morphology , we have another rich source of data for diachronic syntax . in addition to regularity of change , we need general principles of change for plausible reconstruction , e . g . phonological principles that predict likely changes like assimilation , lenition , segment loss , etc . in syntax , similar principles of change exist as well : spatial nouns become spatial adpositions , certain general verbs become tense and aspect markers , allative case markers become dative case markers , purposive verb forms become infinitives , etc . all these processes ( instances of grammaticalization ) are irreversible changes and provide safe guides for linguists seeking to make sense of daughter language diversity by reconstructing a proto-syntax . the massive regularities of grammaticalization are generally ignored in generative studies of syntactic change ( indeed , lightfoot argues that there are no genuine principles of diachronic syntax ) , but if one takes them into account , they help in the difficult task of reconstruction . martin haspelmath ( free university of berlin )",Safe Email

object is blunt and the airflow is turbulent, blah blah blah. Terminal velocity
for a skydiver actually varies with how the diver holds themselves -- you go
faster if you pull yourself into a cannonball. That is the ""A"", for the
most part. All else being equal, the terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the
square root of air density. Air density drops off pretty quickly, and I 
really should be doing something other than digging up the math for that. I
think it involves calculus to integrate the amount of mass as the column of
the atmosphere trails off. I grabbed the other stuff directly out of a book :).In '87 a guy named Gregory Robertson noticed a fellow parachutist Debbie

"esl in children cut off from their native language - any insights ? 2 years ago , my wife and i adopted two kids from russia , at the time aged 6 . 5 and 5 . at the time , i informally asked around and got the impression that there was unlikely to be anything particularly interesting linguistically about their experiences in learning english , and was referred to several books on esl / 2nd language learning among immigrants . unfortunately , due to the joys of parenting , i never read most of the references i was given ( i spent the time trying to learn russian instead ) . i recently read something in another adoptive parent 's posted experience that made me again wonder about my kids ' experiences in learning english , which so far have apparently been a little unusual for adoptive kids ( i ' ll skip the details at this point in my inquiry ) . i am starting to wonder if there is indeed something important in the language experiences of kids adopted into a foreign language environment after infancy . the key difference between international adoptions and other esl situations is that the older adopted kids suddenly are cut off from input in their native language with a certain level of vocabulary and mastery of that language , and thrown into an esl / 2nd language situation where they learn a new language usually with no support in their native language . learning the new language takes a considerable amount of time - my kids could communicate only minimally in english for about a year , but for most adoptive kids , use of the 1st language seems to stop within 1 - 3 months since the kids seem to realize that it no longer serves any useful communicative function . after 2 years , my kids speak what to most people sounds like fluent idiomatic english . however , their vocabulary seems greatly restricted compared to native english kids their age - and their passive vocabulary ( words they understand that they do n't use themselves ) seems to be especially restricted . they also have some peculiarities in grammar and usage - perhaps those typical of second language speakers , but ignored in the adoptive kids since they speak with no trace of an accent . these problems seem to be especially persistent , probably because they pass unnoticed most of the time ( they do show up in the kids ' writing now ) and they are resistent to correction . my readings in linguistics have thus far all seemed to generalize about a critical period lasting past my kids ' age , where they are supposed to learn languages like a sponge . the other adoptive parent , however , posted that in talking with esl experts , she found out that "" esl learners generally cannot do phonics in the second language , nor can they follow along in group oral reading . it takes 7 to 11 years in the second language to develop the ability to manipulate written english , particularly abstract cognitive academic material . "" that poster also said that children completely removed from their native language "" before mastering all of its principles "" have especial problems in learning the new language . she also said that many of the normal esl procedures break down in such kids , that there are no good tests for diagnosing language and learning problems in such kids , and that the situation is enough unlike the normal esl situation that trained esl teachers may not recognize problems or know how to solve them . she gave several references , but mostly on the pragmatic "" how to help your kid "" level . but putting on my linguist hat , and reading between the lines , i came up with some questions that i put to the linguistic community : 1 . is anyone reading this doing any research relating to language acquisition in kids cut off from their native tongue in the formative years ? 2 . can anyone provide me references to such work ? 3 . whether i get answers to # 1 or # 2 , what years are the "" formative years "" in which cutting off the child from the native language will have an effect on 2nd language learning ? 4 . does this age range have any relation to the "" critical period "" of language learning ? might there be a correlation that would tell us something about how and why kids learn languages differently and more easily than adults ? 5 . what are the different effects of cutting off a child from his native language at different ages / stages in language formation ? it seems pretty obvious that at the earliest years , "" 2nd language "" learning would asymptotically approach identity with the learning of the first language . 6 . when 1st and 2nd languages have contrasting features , it would seem that these kids would provide especial insight into ug models with parameters , in addition providing some clue as to when and how the parameters are set . has anyone looked at this ? 7 . what is the long-term language prognosis for such kids ? 7 to 11 years of language difficulty , when the difficulty often goes unnoticed ( or at least the fact that the difficulty is due to language problems - the adoptive parent who posted gave a detailed chronicle of her daughter 's varying problems from adoption at age 4 until 5th grade when the parent finally came to find out why her daughter was having problems even though she spoke english fluently ) - this seems likely to have severe long-term effects . 8 . my kids and all others i know of have completely lost the native language except for word isolates . do such kids relearn their native language any easier when they get older ? again , looking at contrasting features that such kids have difficulty relearning might tell us a lot about "" parameter setting "" especially when the difficulties do not match those of others acquiring the language as a 2nd langusge with no prior experience in the language . kids cut off from the native language would seem more likely to give clear data on this . 9 . are the effects of being cut-off from one 's native language different in kids like mine ? my kids were cut off from the native language only incompletely - they still had each other to talk to , in addition to my wife and my rudimentary self-teaching - but all of this continued exposure to the native language was impoverished both in vocabulary and grammar . ) russian remained the language of our household for most of the kids ' first year here , and i quickly came to understand the differences in language at differing ages . i could understand and communicate with my kids quite well ( and fluently ) in russian after about a month , but still cannot understand even a slow talking russian adult . the types of errors kids tolerate ( and make - my kids often had the ' wrong ' declensional ending on irregular words ) seem quite different from what adults accept . 10 . are there any english language discussions about child language acquisition in russian kids ? ( i ' m sure there are russian language sources , but i would never get through them . ) i would like to know what the typical russian child at the age my kids were adopted would typically have mastered in features like declensions , numbers , perfective / imperfective distinctions , and proper use of cases - things that i have n't mastered well enough to be able to extract from relistening to tapes thaty i made while they still spoke russian fluently . lojbab lojbab @ access . digex . net bob lechevalier , president , the logical language group , inc . 2904 beau lane , fairfax va 22031-1303 usa 703-385 - 0273 for the artificial language loglan / lojban , see ftp . cs . yale . edu / pub / lojban or see lojban www server : href = "" http : / / xiron . pc . helsinki . fi / lojban / """,Safe Email

Dec. 1, 2002KASHIWA, Chiba -- A man has been arrested for using his camera-equipped
mobile phone to take a photo of the inside of a schoolgirl's skirt
as she rode an escalator here, police said.Toyokazu Hamano, 40, a company employee from Noda, Chiba Prefecture,
was arrested for breaking a Chiba Prefectural Government law

JR Kashiwa Station when he took out his mobile phone, held it
underneath the girl's skirt and took a photo. The girl was alerted

"the "" black hole "" of pre - chomskyan citations steve anderson 's new book on morphology should contain the follow - ing epigraph ( if he did n't change it before publication ) : "" linguistics will become a science when linguists begin standing on one another 's shoulders instead of one another 's toes "" . i think he has a point . we have reached the point where we are redoing some aspects of language more poorly than they were done the first time . the problem may have originated from the fact that little had been done in syntax prior to the work of the generative school ; little , that is , in comparison to what has been done since the instigation of that movement . jakobson 's and halle 's work in distinctive features also clearly superceded pre - vious work , making it difficult to find structuralist work relevant to what is going on today . however , anderson is right in chiding us for carrying this attitude over to morphology , where the current trend in and around massachusetts has hardly moved beyond bloomfield , the first to claim that affixes are regular lexical items . first rate morphologi - cal study goes back to the stoic philosophers , who were the first to tease apart grammatical categories and , on a different track , back to panini . not only is most current morphology failing to cite relevant sources , it is failing to take advantage of the discoveries of struc - turalist , neogrammarian , and even classical morphologists . these pre - decessors were particularly adept at finding problems in the theory of the linguistic sign . varro ( 47-45 ) was the first to attempt to define lexical categories in terms of [ + / - n , + / - v ] as well as lexicalizations . aristotle noticed that grammatical morphemes differed from lexical ones and the stoics first used the terms "" signifier "" and "" signified "" . i am jumping into the middle of this discussion but i think mark has touched the real issue : it is less that chomsky and other members of his school are quoted so much than that many others who make contri - butions - - often the same ones - - are quoted to little . the result which i am seeing more and more often is the second , third , fourth reinvention of the wheel . - - rbeard",Safe Email

( this has been the stated process for the bottom two categories , and we are adding satisfactory to this process as well . ) please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team , yourself , or an hr professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced members of your management team , or those management team members where you have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and perhaps tough performance feedback . i believe that we have spent some time in identifying these situations . i ask your help to ensure that we follow through on this commitment . thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid - year prc process a meaningful one . it is dave delainey ' s intent to announce it if 0",Safe Email

( nor has it explained the extensive use of star wars - related names by the related - party companies . ) it ' s not immediately clear what es power 3 is or does . so far , subpoenas issued by lawyers suing enron have determined the names of senior officers of es power 3 and its formation date , january 1999 . among es power 3 ' s senior executives are enron ceo ken lay , listed as a director , and mcmahon and fastow , listed as executive vice presidents . a raft of external directors are named as es power 3 directors , including comdisco ceo norman blake and ronnie chan , chairman of the hong kong - based hang lung group . a comdisco spokeswoman says blake isn ' t commenting on matters concerning enron and a call to the hang lung group wasn ' t immediately returned . demands , demands rating agencies moody ' s , fitch and s & p recently put enron ' s credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an ljm deal that led to the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity . enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade . but its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade , or junk , bonds , suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely . if enron ' s rating drops below investment grade , it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $ 3 . 4 billion in off - balance sheet obligations . in addition , many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade . friday , the company drew down $ 3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations . raising cash in the cp market could be tough when investors are jittery about enron ' s condition . this week , a number of energy market players reduced exposure to enron . however , in a friday press release , ceo lay said that enron was the "" market - maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets . "" he added : "" it is evident that our customers view enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets . "" mcmahon reportedly objected to fastow ' s role in ljm , allegedly believing it posed fastow with a conflict of interests . but he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he ' s connected to don ' t do the same . enron has said that its board fully approved of the ljm deals that fastow was involved in . now , board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity . under the radar : enron ' s flickering bulb by christopher edmonds special to thestreet . com 10 / 26 / 2001 05 : 08 pm edt url : while the bulb at enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) may not have burnt out , it ' s clearly flickering . to date , investors aren ' t sure whether chairman and ceo ken lay is up to the task of re - energizing the company he once built to greatness . what ' s happened at the houston energy giant - turned - dwarf could ' ve been imagined with any number of ne ' er - do - well companies during the well - chronicled bubble . but this is enron . as one longtime enron bull and shareholder said , "" i never had to worry about enron ' s ability to survive until this week . i still find it hard to believe . "" peter eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling enron ' s adventures for some time . if you ' d listened to him earlier this year , you ' d have profited from his knowledge . his reporting on enron ' s partnership shenanigans to the departure of chief financial officer andrew fastow has been outstanding . the rumors - - from a pending bankruptcy to a justice department investigation - - are , for now , just that . and , enron did not single - handedly cause the california power crisis , nor is royal dutch / shell ( rd : nyse - news - commentary ) about to make a bid to buy the company . sources do tell me that head - count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business . and , while former ceo jeff skilling shares culpability for the current mess , his departure appears only indirectly related to enron ' s current woes . now , enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and , more importantly , its reputation . the company ' s challenge but what does enron do now ? it ' s very simple . come clean , clean up the mess and refocus on its core business : wholesale energy markets , risk management and retail energy services . they support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks . "" our gut feel is that enron can pull it off , and long - term investors should hold firm , as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings , with upside potential to $ 25 per share over the next 12 - 18 months , "" says jeff dietert , power analyst at simmons & co . and a member of the tsc energy roundtable . "" we believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery . "" dietert outlines four challenges for enron . one , management must regain the street ' s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance - sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow . two , enron must maintain its investment - grade credit rating . three , enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans . four , enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write - down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book . straightforward ? yes . easy to accomplish ? no . although enron says additional write - downs are unlikely - - except a $ 200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change - - analysts aren ' t so sure . they ' re focused on the company ' s global assets portfolio , sporting $ 6 billion in book value but generating an ebit ( earnings before interest and taxes ) loss of $ 18 million over the past 12 months . the divestitures include $ 390 million in exploration and production assets in india , $ 250 million in a puerto rico power plant and $ 250 million in a brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of portland general , which is set to close in 2002 . there will likely be others . however , enron has to execute here , and given the current state of its affairs , the seller will feel the pressure . the credit - rating issue is a fine line . the current ratings , bbb + from standard & poor ' s and baal from moody ' s , are three levels above non - investment grade . however , both rating agencies now have enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades . dietert estimates that enron ' s debt - to - market cap will be about 48 % by year - end , and the company has interest coverage ( ebitda / interest expense ) of about 3 . 5 times . by comparison , the average s the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades ; potentially lower credit ratings force counter - parties to reduce exposure to enron , limiting enron ' s ability to generate earnings and cash flow . "" it ' s time for enron to grow up . despite a lot of uncertainties and risk , i think it will . investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy . it ' s a tough call that requires strict , individual discipline . there ' s an irony to this whole story , especially in enron ' s lack of candor in reporting its financial results . in a much - lauded advertising campaign , enron , looking to challenge conventional wisdom , asks the simple question , "" why ? ask why .

' s ( ene ) retail sales unit defaulted on its credit requirement in new england ' s wholesale power market this month , but the event was neither unique nor newsworthy , the energy company and the organization that developed the market ' s rules said friday . the operator of the region ' s wholesale power market informed enron energy services last week that , for the third time in 12 months , it had traded a greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at risk for expulsion from new england ' s market . but it was administrative mixups , rather than financial problems , that triggered the warning , which a few other companies have also received in the past , the market ' s rulemaker said . "" i can state with considerable confidence that there have been other participants "" that have defaulted on their credit agreements , "" and it ' s never been in the news , "" said david doot , secretary and general counsel for the new england power pool , which developed the policies governing the region ' s electricity market . "" my instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of proportion . "" news of the enron unit ' s default appeared in a trade publication and a major metropolitan newspaper this week , as enron ' s dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company ' s stock and bond prices . enron energy services never received word that it had defaulted on its bonding requirement twice before , because both times it corrected the problem within a day , spokeswoman peggy mahoney said . the letter sent by iso new england , which operates the region ' s power market , to notify the enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong person , delaying the company ' s response , mahoney said . "" clearly , it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit , "" mahoney said . the company resolved the problem by oct . 19 , mahoney said . iso new england spokeswoman ellen foley confirmed friday that the company had cured its default . it ' s rare for a company to default three times , but it has happened on occasion , foley and doot said . "" i won ' t say it ' s commonplace , but i won ' t say it ' s unusual for a participant to find itself out of compliance , "" doot said . "" those things have in fact happened from time to time .

gas pipelines . that allowed enron to move debt associated with those projects off its books . the affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money . they plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets . enron might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and the debt . that could amount to at least $ 3 . 3 billion if the assets don ' t generate any money , a remote possibility , the company has said . few answers investors and analysts pressed enron chief executive officer kenneth lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a conference call tuesday . today , enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t respond to questions about one of them , es power 3 llc . texas records list 78 enron executives and employees as officers , directors and managers of es power 3 llc . the entire enron board is also listed . shares of enron $ 1 . 15 to $ 15 . 20 in late trading . -

' ' ' lockyer later apologized for the remark . the attorney general ' s investigation is proceeding , lockyer spokeswoman sandra michioku said . michioku said she didn ' t know when civil or criminal charges against enron or other power providers might be filed . ` ` our investigation is still being pursued , ' ' she said . ` ` we had to go to court to get enron to turn over documents , so that slowed things down a bit . ' ' enron ' s palmer said he didn ' t know the status of the attorney general ' s investigation . ` ` i think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman , ' ' palmer said . more lawsuits enron , along with other major power providers such as duke energy corp . and dynegy inc . , face at least five lawsuits alleging they manipulated california energy prices in violation of antitrust laws . the cases , which include separate complaints filed by the city of san francisco , california lieutenant governor cruz bustamante and various consumers , currently are in state courts awaiting a coordination proceeding , said michael aguirre , a lawyer representing bustamante . the lawsuits should be assigned to a judge by the end of next month , he said . if the complaints succeed , the companies might be ordered to repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines , including triple damages . enron ' s stock fell 95 cents , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 15 . 40 , declining for the eighth day in a row . the shares have fallen 80 percent in the past 12 months . - - daniel taub in los angeles , ( 323 ) 801 - 1261 or enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 5 ) 2001 - 10 - 26 16 : 18 ( new york ) enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 5 ) ( adds investor comment in fourth paragraph . ) houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $ 3 billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low - interest , short - term loans . the company ' s stock has fallen 54 percent in the past 14 days after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by enron ' s former chief financial officer . the shares fell 95 cents , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 15 . 40 today . chief executive officer kenneth lay has failed to reassure investors that the company ' s credit rating won ' t be cut , investors said . enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets , where short - term loans carry lower rates than banks offer . ` ` do they have the financial flexibility they once had ? no , ' ' said john cassady , who helps manage $ 3 billion in bonds at fifth third bancorp . ` ` people are questioning the credibility of management . ' ' the company will use its credit line to pay off $ 2 . 2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding , enron spokesman mark palmer said . bonds drop enron ' s 6 3 / 4 percent bonds , which mature in 2009 , declined 1 1 / 2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents . at that price , the bonds , which carry a rating of ` ` bbb + , ' ' yield 9 . 53 percent . investors have grown concerned that the company ' s credit rating will be cut after $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses from failed investments . enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions . enron ' s decision to tap its credit line was ` ` a smart financial move , ' ' said stephen moore , a vice president at moody ' s investors service who follows the company . ` ` it took away the hassle and time - consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital . ' ' though enron ' s bonds have investment - grade ratings , their yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds that carry junk ratings . according to bloomberg data , companies with ` ` bb ' ' ratings pay on average 9 . 16 percent to borrow for seven years . a lower credit rating may also force enron to buy back holdings in other partnerships with its stock , diluting the value of enron investors ' stock . partnerships called whitewing , marlin and yosemite own enron assets they bought with borrowed money . enron sold the assets to the partnerships to keep related debt off its books . the partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the assets . other liabilities if enron loses investment - grade rating , the borrowed money comes due earlier , leaving less time for the partnerships to find the best price for the power plants and other assets . enron would have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell for and the amount of the debt . one way would be issuing common shares to exchange for enron preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships . that would thin out the holdings of every other investor . of the two main bond - rating companies , moody ' s and fitch have enron on watch for possible downgrade , and standard & poor ' s lowered enron ' s long - term credit outlook to negative . egan - jones rating co . today lowered its rating on enron ' s debt to ` ` bb + , ' ' one notch below investment grade , from ` ` bbb - . ' ' enron ' s liabilities associated with the partnerships amount to at least $ 3 . 3 billion , the company has said . enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow on wednesday amid a securities and exchange commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost the company $ 35 million in direct losses . enron also bought back 62 million shares from the partnership , reducing shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion . ` ` it looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the benefit of himself , ' ' fifth third ' s cassady said . jeff mcmahon , head of enron ' s industrial markets group , was named cfo in a bid to restore investor confidence , lay said in a statement . - - russell hubbard in the princeton newsroom at 609 - 750 - 4651 , or at keller rohrback l . l . p . investigates potential claims on behalf of enron corp . - - ene - - employees and former employees 10 / 26 / 2001 business wire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire ) seattle - - ( business wire ) - - oct . 26 , 2001 - - seattle ' s keller rohrback l . l . p . is currently investigating potential erisa claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of enron ' s retirement and 401 ( k ) plans . the investigation period covers january 2000 through october 2001 . the investigation focuses on concerns that , under the law interpreting erisa , enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a plan investment . rather than providing complete and accurate information to the plans ' participants , it may be alleged that enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information , thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the plans . this investigation is being conducted in light of recent events . on oct . 16 , 2001 , enron surprised the market when it announced that the company was taking "" non - recurring charges totaling $ 1 . 01 billion after - tax , or ( $ 1 . 11 ) loss per diluted share , "" in the third quarter of 2001 . enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships , controlled by enron ' s cfo , and that the company would be eliminating more than $ 1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments . as this news began to be assimilated by the market , the price of enron common stock dropped significantly . in addition , several recently filed securities suits allege that enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading , gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds . enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets . if you are a member of an enron retirement plan , wish to discuss this announcement , or have information relevant to the investigation , you may contact paralegal liza catabay , or any member of our team ( britt tinglum , liza catabay , or lynn sarko ) toll free at 800 / 776 - 6044 , or via e - mail at investor @ kellerrohrback . com . seattle ' s keller rohrback l . l . p . has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade . its trial lawyers have obtained judgments and settlements on behalf of clients in excess of seven billion dollars . contact : keller rohrback l . l . p . liza catabay , 800 / 776 - 6044 investor @ kellerrohrback . com www . seattleclassaction . com 15 : 16 edt october 26 , 2001 copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .",Safe Email

"fw : ferc meeting summary the commission held its first open meeting with pat wood as the new chairman today and discussed many interesting issues . the following is a summary of the meeting . the meeting is still going on , and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon ( regarding market power ) . rtos chairman wood expressed his desire to finish the rto transition , and that the commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the rto transition . chairman wood considers the rto effort on two tracks : 1 ) organizational - - what will the rto organizations look like , and 2 ) substantive - - once you set up the organizations , what will they do . organizational effort : wood stated that this effort has already begun with the july 12 orders and the northeast and southeast mediation efforts . the commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast , southeast and midwest within the next couple of ferc meetings . wood also stated that it is time for rto west and desert star to "" marry up , "" meaning , i suppose , that the two should consolidate . wood does not think that california can be included in the western rto yet since it has lingering problems . structural effort : the commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in order no . 2000 into rto structures . to achieve this goal , the commission is establishing an "" rto week "" of advanced workshops , from october 15 - 19 , in advance of issuing a nopr , to address structural issues such as : congestion management ; cost recovery ; market monitoring ; transmission planning ; reliability ; transmission rights . wood also envisions that the commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing order no . 888 transmission tariff . the new tariff will apply to all public utilities and rtos . wood also recognized that some "" sticks "" are needed to entice rto participation . therefore , wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by december 15 , 2001 with a declaration to join an rto . if they do not make this declaration , these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis . furthermore , wood states that if entities do not join rtos , they should not be authorized to merge their facilities , and that ferc will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by rtos . wood states that these "" sticks "" provide incentive , but do not mandate , rto participation . with regard to the pending requests for rehearing , wood asked legal staff to figure out how "" ferc can get there . "" in other words , i think wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing . while commissioner breathitt is skeptical about some of these rto proposals , because she was not required to vote on anything today , she only expressed her concern . upcoming dates october 15 - 19 - - rto workshops end of october - - further orders on northeast , southeast , midwest rtos december 15 , 2001 - - all public utilities must commit to an rto or have their market based rates revoked proposed rule for standards of conduct within the next few days , ferc will be issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking ( "" nopr "" ) on standards of conduct for transmission providers . as explained at the meeting ( we do not have a copy of the nopr yet ) , the nopr will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly . the nopr also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates , not just marketers . the standards of conduct would not apply to rtos and transmission providers who are members of an rto may ask for an exemption from the standards . the nopr will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission - owners ' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers . as you know , the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of tos that are only buying and selling power for native load customers . as the interim general counsel noted , these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the to . there was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load . staff told the commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules . pat wood said they will include the proposal in the nopr ( breathitt may not support ) , but if the industry does not support the proposal , ferc will pull it . we of course will strongly support the proposal . provision of adequate electrical capacity ( icap ) chairman wood asked staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements . wood noted that the commission had to issue an order on icap in new england during their recess in august , and he is not that familiar with the issues . therefore , he asked staff to prepare a presentation , which they made at the meeting this morning . the presentation will be made public within the next couple of days . in sum , staff seems to believe that some type of icap requirement is needed for reliability . after the presentation , wood noted that the new england icap order has enough wiggle room to allow the commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue . wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized , competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply ( without politically unacceptable , prolonged price spikes ) . commissioner brownell ( from the pennsylvania puc ) has a better understanding of icap and expressed concerns that icap may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers . realizing that there are many positions on this topic , chairman wood said he will publish the staff report and ask for comments by october 17 . we will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process . sorry this is so long , but a lot happened today . we will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over . let us know if you have any questions . sarah",Safe Email

This was poking fun of the practice of making
up differnt types of speech with different
types of protected status.  I think the
laws specialing out hate and protected speech
are ridiculous.  The point I keep trying to make
is that there's only two types, speech and action. 
I agree, they are all speech and should be 
covered by the First Amendment, butIf hate speech is so protected, why are certain
states trying to prosecute people for it?  There's
only two answers and one of them is wrong.  1) Because hate speech is different and needs to
     have a different level of protection dictated
     by whoever's offended at the time.
  2) It's because it's not just speech, but action.
     A action who's consequences are foreseeable by 
     any reasonable person. Hate speech is mislabeled.  It's really ""threat"".  I think
they let the mislabeling perpetuate as there's advantage
in being able to counter-threat with loss of liberty and
money through civil and criminal lawsuits for people THEY
don't like.

Strange.I had the double IRQ problem with the 3c509 combo, 
and turning pnp off in the card's firware fixed it.As far as I remember the problem I was having was 
that the driver was assigning an IRQ to the card's
 RJ45 port and then another IRQ to it's BNC port,
 and then referenced the card via the second assigned irq,
 and turning off PnP in the card's firmware fixed that.You must be having a different error
Else
PnP is still turned on.
<>
Making sure the IRQ and io space you assign

"re : project doorstep responsibility matrix thanks for the summary . i was out last week so apologies if my comments arrive too late . here they are anyway : 1 socrates i think it inappropriate for me , or anyone in rac for that matter , to have primary responsibility for this system / project . but if i were responsible the first thing i would want to know is why this project , which commenced in may 1998 , as i recall , is still incomplete , given that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in history , concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart . 2 exhaustive ? it doesn ' t look like an exhaustive list and i suspect it was not intended to be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such . 3 symptoms or causes ? many of the points look like the former , and addressed as they stand will likely leave us with a band - aid solution which will drop off when pressure is applied . in fact many of them look like they are a result of point 5 : "" prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control functionality . . . "" because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten , confirmation errors get made , deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think about changing the way they work . and , for example , when those people move on , as they surely will , the institution has no memory of how to do what they did . i am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on microsoft excel all day , everyday . 4 overall i think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way . rather than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking off , we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operate . as a hypothesis , if most issues stem from point 5 , then i would ask why has prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control functionality ? dp brent a price @ ect 05 / 08 / 2000 11 : 08 am to : mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , steve w young / lon / ect @ ect , tani nath / lon / ect @ ect , mark pickering / lon / ect @ ect , joe gold / lon / ect @ ect , james new / lon / ect @ ect , richard lewis / lon / ect @ ect , michael r brown / lon / ect @ ect , andrew cornfield / lon / ect @ ect , tim davies / lon / ect @ ect , rebecca millerchip / lon / ect @ ect , kevin sweeney / hou / ect @ ect , pablo pissanetzky / lon / ect @ ect , gail hill / lon / ect @ ect , eric virro / lon / ect @ ect , richard sage / lon / ect @ ect , tim poullain - patterson / lon / ect @ ect , ian sloman / lon / ect @ ect , david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron cc : fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect subject : project doorstep responsibility matrix attached is a responsibility matrix for london - project doorstep action steps . the listing consists of controls findings , action steps , proposed timelines , and proposed sponsors and responsibility assignments for the completion of the action steps . the purpose of this matrix will be to review and monitor it on an ongoing basis to ensure that items are being appropriately addressed and completed . please take a moment to review all sections of the listing and communicate any comments or revisions you may have to me as soon as possible . we would like to have a final version of this document in place by may 12 .",Safe Email

portable either, but it's nice they are trying. The Windows I/O model does
definately blow the doors off the UNIX one, but then they had select to
point at in it's suckiness and anything would have been an improvement. UNIX
is just now looking at it's I/O model and adapting to a multiprocess
multithreaded world so it's gonna be years yet before a posix API comes out
of it. Bottom line is the ""do stuff when something happens"" model turned out
to be right, and the UNIX ""look for something to do and keep looking till
you find it no matter how many times you have to look"" is not really working

Discover The Best Kept Secret In America!Turning $300 Into $20,000In Oklahoma, Craig
Talkington purchased a Tax Lien on a 5 acre parcel for
$300. The owner failed to pay the taxes and forfeited
the 5-acre parcel to Craig Talkington. A short time
later Craig sold that property to one of the neighbors
for $20,000. That's the kind of money that buys new
cars and sends young people to college. Craig didn't
stop at one deal. He later bought a tax lien for only
$17 on a ten acre track, the property owner failed to
pay the taxes, and Craig ended up the property, which
he sold for $4,000. I don't know how much money you
are making right now but these are the kinds of
profits that change peoples lives and solve financial
problems and make things a lot better.

"Raymond L. Wallace, 83
Bigfoot Story Teller
(1919-2002)Ray Wallace, a controversial figure involved in 44 years of Bigfoot-related
events, died November 26, 2002, in Toledo, Washington.  The Washington State
construction tycoon had been ill for some time, living in a Toledo rest
home.It was at Bluff Creek, California, in 1958, which found Ray WallaceÂ¹s
company building a new road through the northern California forest.   In
August through October, Wallace Construction Company's employee Jerry Crew
found tracks of a huge humanlike foot.  Thanks to instructions from
taxidermist Bob Titmus, Crew made the first plaster casts of a footprint
from this hairy upright creature his fellow workers called Â³Bigfoot.Â²  Crew
took the cast to town, to quiet local ridicule, and showed it to a Humboldt
County newspaper editor.  The photograph of Jerry Crew with the giant
plaster of Paris foot imprint went out over the newswires.   It produced a
revolutionary shift from small regional stories of Sasquatch to todayÂ¹s
global awareness of Bigfoot. Soon after the publicized Crew finds, Wallace
and his brother claimed other Bigfoot activity around the construction site;
Wallace said he found tracks and droppings of Bigfoot.Wallace was to be involved with the local tales of hairy giants for the rest
of his life.  Allegedly in the later in the 1950s, for example, Wallace
offered to sell Texas millionaire Tom Slick a captured Bigfoot.  Wallace
failed to produce the creature when Slick came up with an offer. Down
through the years, Wallace would carry on pranks, be tied to carved fake
Sasquatch feet, and produce and try to sell dubious photographs and films.
He was a great letter writer and would pen long passages to magazine editors
about this photographs or telling of how he knew a Bigfoot was nearby
guarding a mine full of gold.  After awhile, most Bigfoot hunters and
researchers took Wallace as merely a spinner of fanciful tall tales. Through
his contributions to Strange Magazine, the Track Record, and indirectly to
Fate Magazine, Wallace relished keeping his name in the limelight of the
Bigfoot mystery.In March 1998, Ray Wallace offered a million dollars to the first person who
could bring him a live baby Bigfoot.  Saying he had tracked Bigfoot for
forty years, Wallace claimed he wanted to raise a young Sasquatch to
adulthood. Wallace told reporters he planned to raise a baby Bigfoot with
Â³care and respectÂ² and would like to train the creature to ride around with
him in his pickup truck and help out with chores around his ranch.  No one
came forth with a baby Bigfoot.Ray Wallace added an intriguing, mostly harmless story-telling element to
the otherwise often serious pursuit of Bigfoot that various friends of his,
such as Ray Crowe, Director of the International Bigfoot Society, enjoyed.Ray Wallace was interred at the Lone Hill Cemetery in Toledo, Washington
State, on November 30, 2002.Â©Loren Coleman 2002

"aaai fall symoposium on formalizing context formalizing context aaai-95 fall symposium mit , cambridge , massachusetts november 10-12 , 1995 call for papers description the notion of context has played an important role in ai systems for many years . however , formal logical explication of contexts remains an area of research in which there are significant open issues . this symposium will provide a forum for discussing formalizations of contexts , approaches to resolving open issues , and application areas for context formalisms . the most ambitious goal of formalizing contexts is to make automated reasoning systems which are never permanently stuck with the concepts they use at a given time because they can always transcend the context they are in . such a capability would allow the designer of a reasoning system to include only such phenomena as are required for the system 's immediate purpose , retaining the assurance that if a broader system is required later , "" lifting rules "" can be devised to restate the facts from the narrow context in the broader context with qualifications added as necessary . a formal theory of context in which sentences are always considered as asserted within a context could provide a basis for such transcendence . formal theories of context are also needed to provide a representation of the context associated with a particular circumstance , e . g . the context of a conversation in which terms have particular meanings that they would n't have in the language in general . linguists and philosophers have already studied similar notions of context . an example is the situation theory that has been proposed in philosophy and applied to linguistics . however , these theories usually lie embedded in the analysis of specific linguistic constructions , so locating the exact match with ai concerns is itself a research challenge . this symposium aims to bring together researchers who have studied or applied contexts in ai or related fields . technical papers dealing with formalizations of context , the problem of generality , and use of context in common sense reasoning are especially welcome . however , survey papers which focus on contexts from other points of view , such as philosophy , linguistics , or natural language processing , or which apply contexts in other areas of ai , are also encouraged . submission information persons wishing to make presentations at the workshop should submit papers ( up to 12 pages , 12pt font ) . persons wishing only to attend the workshop should submit a 1 - 2 page research summary including a list of relevant publications . a postscript file or 8 paper copies should be sent to the program chair . limited funding will be available to support student travel . timetable april 14 , 1995 submission deadline . may 19 , 1995 submitters will be informed of decisions august 15 , 1995 final papers due september 20 , 1995 aaai will mail working notes to the participants november 10-12 , 1995 fall symposium program committee sasa buvac ( chair ) . department of computer science , stanford university , stanford ca 94305-2140 . buvac @ sail . stanford . edu richard fikes . knowledge systems laboratory , stanford university , 701 welch road , bldg . c , palo alto , ca 94304 . fikes @ ksl . stanford . edu ramanathan guha . mcc , 3500 , w . balcones center drive , austin , tx 78759 . guha @ mcc . com pat hayes . beckman institute , 405 north mathews av . , urbana , il 61801 . phayes @ cs . uiuc . edu john mccarthy . department of computer science , stanford university , stanford ca 94305-2140 . jmc @ sail . stanford . edu murray shanahan . imperial college , dept of computing , 180 queen 's gate , london sw7 2bz , england . mps @ doc . ic . ac . uk robert stalnaker . 20d-220 , department of linguistics and philosophy , m . i . t . cambridge , ma 02139 . stal @ mit . edu johan van benthem . institute for logic , language and computation , university of amsterdam , plantage muidergracht 24 , 1018 tv amsterdam , the netherlands . johan @ fwi . uva . nl ( postscript and plain text versions of this announcement are available through the symposium www page at http : / / sail . stanford . edu / buvac / 95 - context-symposium and via anonymous ftp from sail . stanford . edu in the directory / buvac / 95 - context-symposium . )",Safe Email

- volatility and premiums on enron ' s near - month options remain extremely high . it is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price for option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the houston company sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled investors . enron near - month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet session wednesday , as investors bought them to hedge . the december 5 puts traded more than 10 , 000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $ 1 . 10 at the chicago board options exchange . the stock closed down $ 1 . 98 , or 28 % , to $ 5 . 01 , as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading . enron ' s calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate income . traders noted some call buying - - especially after enron procured a three - week extension on a $ 690 million note - - as some hopeful investors bet on enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with dynegy inc . enron ' s december 5 calls traded more than 14 , 500 contracts , compared with open interest of 710 , as they fell $ 1 . 45 to $ 1 . 15 at the cboe . for investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten - down stocks , the "" wash sale "" rule can be a hurdle , because it essentially prevents taxpayers from selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring "" substantially identical "" securities within a 30 - day period before or after that loss . this poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose prices now make them attractive "" buy "" candidates . in addition , the internal revenue service has taken the position that the wash - sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in - the - money put , because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquired by the investor . so investors typically get around the wash - sale rule by "" doubling up "" : buying additional stock or options , waiting at least 31 days , and then selling the original stock to book the loss . investors double up by buying calls , which locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying additional stock . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dynegy deal to buy enron hits crossroads by rebecca smith and john r . emshwiller staff reporters of the wall street journal 11 / 23 / 2001 the wall street journal a 3 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) even as it reiterated its intention to purchase enron corp . , dynegy inc . is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the multibillion - dollar deal . the pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of enron shares and the mounting financial problems at the houston energy - trading company , the nation ' s biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas . during the past month , enron has taken a $ 1 billion write - off of assets , revised downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . the problems have been due largely to dealings enron had with private partnerships , run by some of its own executives , under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . in an sec filing monday , enron disclosed hundreds of millions of potential additional write - offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than $ 2 billion in loans by the end of the year . as of 4 p . m . wednesday in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares fell $ 1 . 98 , or 28 % , to $ 5 . 01 each after having dropped 23 % tuesday . in excess of 115 million shares traded wednesday , more than four times the volume of any other big board stock . enron ' s bonds also again traded sharply lower , market observers said . the turmoil spilled over to dynegy ' s stock , which also was among the most actively traded on the new york stock exchange . as of 4 p . m . wednesday , dynegy shares fell $ 1 . 94 to $ 39 . 76 each . on wednesday , dynegy issued a statement in which chairman and chief executive chuck watson said his company was working "" to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement "" though it continued to perform "" due diligence "" on enron . under the merger agreement , dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if enron ' s financial and legal problems become severe enough . however , some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so - called material adverse change clauses . they point to a decision earlier this year by a delaware chancery court judge who forced tyson foods inc . to complete a planned purchase of ibp inc . even though tyson , a springdale , ark . , food - products company , had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in ibp ' s earnings and accounting problems at an ibp unit . dynegy officials didn ' t return calls seeking comment . to complete the deal , two - thirds of dynegy shareholders and a majority of enron shareholders would have to give their approval . no dates for those votes have been set . one person familiar with the merger plans said the sec filing monday by enron contained information dynegy hadn ' t known about . dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company ' s due diligence , this person said . it couldn ' t be determined what the new information was . the merger agreement , announced nov . 9 , calls for dynegy to exchange 0 . 2685 share for each of enron ' s roughly 850 million fully diluted shares , giving the purchase a value of about $ 9 billion at dynegy ' s current stock price . however , from a price standpoint , the deal is appearing less attractive to dynegy . on the day of the merger announcement , enron shares were trading at about $ 8 . 63 each , or about 83 % of the purchase price under the exchange ratio . as of wednesday , enron ' s market price was only about 47 % of the merger - formula price . such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement , when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading relatively close to the offering price . sentiment among wall street analysts also is turning against the merger . initially , many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue enron and provide a major boost to houston - based dynegy . dynegy and enron officials have predicted that the merger , supposed to be completed late next year , would significantly and immediately increase dynegy ' s earnings . now analysts are challenging that assumption . ron barone , managing director at ubs warburg llc , said he believes that because of enron ' s financial problems , a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than dynegy would have by itself . mr . barone said he thinks a "" likely scenario "" is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0 . 15 dynegy share for each enron share . such a ratcheting down wouldn ' t be without precedent in the deal . according to one person familiar with the merger negotiations , dynegy reduced the exchange formula at least once prior to the nov . 9 announcement because of enron ' s rapidly sinking stock price , which at the beginning of this year was above $ 80 a share . in perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on wall street , goldman sachs analyst david fleischer lowered his ratings on enron and dynegy . a longtime enron fan , mr . fleischer issued a report expressing doubts that the merger would help dynegy ' s earnings and whether enron could "" recover the significant business that has been lost "" in its giant energy - trading operations . "" the enron machine continues to sputter , "" mr . fleischer wrote . some observers say that if dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to renegotiate the terms significantly , enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy - law filing . without the dynegy acquisition and continued support from its bankers and customers , an enron bankruptcy - court filing "" is highly possible , "" said ralph pellecchia , a senior director at fitch , a credit - ratings agency . on wednesday , fitch maintained its credit rating on enron at just one notch above noninvestment - grade , or "" junk , "" status . but fitch also said it believed enron ' s trading partners had made "" significant cash collateral calls "" in recent days that are "" well in excess of previous expectations , "" contributing to "" liquidity pressures . "" among the advisers enron has hired during its current crisis is the law firm of weil , gotshal & manges , which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate - workout situations . asked about a possible bankruptcy filing , an enron spokeswoman said the company expects the dynegy deal to go through and therefore doesn ' t expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger . since the merger announcement , enron chairman kenneth lay has said his company had alternatives to the dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them . enron said it made some progress improving its financial position . the company said it reached a final agreement with units of j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . on the remaining $ 450 million of a previously announced $ 1 billion in secured credit lines . enron said lenders had agreed to extend repayment of an existing $ 690 million note to mid - december from next week . the spokeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be completed next month so that repayment wouldn ' t be required this year . - - - thaddeus herrick and robin sidel contributed to this article . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron faces suits by 401 ( k ) plan participants by theo francis and ellen schultz staff reporters of the wall street journal 11 / 23 / 2001 the wall street journal cl ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) enron corp . , the embattled houston energy and trading company , has been sued by members of its employee - retirement plan , which has suffered losses because of enron ' s plummeting stock price . two separate lawsuits , filed in federal court in houston , allege enron misled participants in its 401 ( k ) retirement plan about the risks of investing in the company ' s shares and note that the company forced the employees to remain invested in its stock even as the shares fell . amid growing disclosures of financial problems in recent weeks , the company "" locked down "" the retirement plan from oct . 17 to nov . 19 to make administrative changes , which prevented employees from selling enron shares as the share price collapsed . enron , which recently agreed to be acquired by dynegy inc . , houston , because of mounting financial problems , has seen its stock price fall to $ 5 . 01 on wednesday from a peak of nearly $ 90 a share last year . the decline has been costly to participants in enron ' s retirement plan because more than 60 % of the 401 ( k ) assets were invested in enron shares at the end of last year , according to one of the suits . the first suit was filed nov . 13 on behalf of plan participants by campbell harrison & wright llp , a houston law firm , and the second was filed tuesday by seattle - based hagens berman llp . both seek class - action certification . enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits . a spokeswoman also said the company ' s 401 ( k ) plan offers participants 18 investment choices , one of which is company stock . the company ' s stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it had extensive off - balance - sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed by former company officials . the securities and exchange commission has launched a formal investigation into the company ' s accounting , and enron has said it will restate years of financial information . the suits against enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against companies over losses in the company - stock portion of their 401 ( k ) plans . the suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continuing to offer company stock , even after they became aware of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price . all the suits are pending . as with most of these companies , enron matches employee contributions to the 401 ( k ) with shares of enron stock , and also offers enron stock as an investment choice , in addition to a variety of mutual funds . about $ 1 . 3 billion of the plan ' s $ 2 . 1 billion in assets was invested in enron shares at the end of 2000 , according to the suit filed by campbell harrison . pamela tittle , a participant in the 401 ( k ) plan who worked in the finance department and a named plaintiff in the enron suit filed by campbell harrison & wright , had roughly 2 , 000 shares of enron stock in her retirement account and has suffered losses of about $ 140 , 000 as a result of the stock ' s decline . the suit alleges that the trustees of the enron 401 ( k ) plan violated their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company stock was in peril . the suit filed by hagens berman , also alleges that the company failed to warn participants about risks of remaining invested in enron stock . in addition , it accuses enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial results since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the sec . roy e . rinard , a lineman for enron in oregon who is a named plaintiff in the suit filed by hagens berman , has seen the value of his retirement plan fall to $ 70 , 000 from $ 470 , 000 , largely as a result of the decline in enron ' s stock . "" i feel like i have been betrayed , "" mr . rinard said in press release issued by his lawyers . "" i lost my savings , my plans for the future , everything . "" under federal pension law , companies are allowed to offer their own stock in retirement plans , and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the stock . enron doesn ' t let employees diversify out of shares they receive as matching contributions to the 401 ( k ) plan until age 50 . however , plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interests of the participants , which includes choosing prudent investments . generally , to prove that the plan ' s administrators breached their fiduciary duties , employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investment . this presents a high hurdle , so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits over losses in company stock in 401 ( k ) plans have generally come in the wake of allegations of accounting irregularities . lynn sarko , one of ms . tittle ' s attorneys with seattle ' s keller rohrback llp , is also co - lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against lucent technologies inc . , murray hill , n . j . another firm representing ms . tittle is dalton gotto samson & kilgard plc , which is lead counsel in a similar suit against ikon office solutions inc . , malvern , pa . the two law firms are representing ms . tittle with campbell harrison & wright . the suits against lucent and ikon , like the suit against enron , allege that then - current plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price . representatives for ikon and lucent say their companies didn ' t require employees to invest in the company stock , and educated employees about the need for diversification . the suit in which mr . rinard is plaintiff notes that on oct . 17 , a day after enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling $ 1 . 01 billion in the third quarter , enron "" locked down "" the 401 ( k ) plan ' s assets , preventing participants from selling enron shares . ( a "" lock - down "" occurs when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another , and generally lasts several weeks , during which time participants can ' t make changes in their investment choices ) . the lock - down was lifted on nov . 19 . in the interim , on nov . 8 , enron announced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results from 1997 through 2000 . by the time the lock - down was lifted , as a result of all the negative news the shares had fallen to below $ 9 a share from $ 32 . 20 on oct . 17 , when the lockup started , hagens berman attorney karl barth said .

"" copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c from sunbeam to enron , andersen ' s reputation suffers by floyd norris 11 / 23 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company this has been the worst year ever for arthur andersen , the accounting firm that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry . the securities and exchange commission filed civil fraud complaints against the andersen partner who audited sunbeam and against the firm itself in the waste management case . now enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by arthur andersen , in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from the company ' s reported profits in recent years . all of which raises the question : has arthur andersen become the black sheep of the accounting industry ? it is not an easy question to answer , and not everyone is willing to rush to judgment . ' ' if you want to attack andersen for enron , you need to know more than we know , ' ' arthur levitt , the former chairman of the securities and exchange commission , said this week . but if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases , it is materiality . in all three cases , andersen auditors spotted bad accounting but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahead . materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into trouble . the idea is that it doesn ' t much matter if a few little things were gotten wrong . but they can add up . at enron , however , they did not add up to that much - - a total of $ 93 million over four years . the biggest restatement of enron profits concerns a related party that enron now says should have been consolidated . it is not clear if andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time . to those who treasure the role of auditors , the humiliation of andersen is painful . back in the 1950 ' s , it was leonard spacek , andersen ' s managing partner , who warned that ' ' the profession ' s existence is in peril ' ' because it was not showing enough independence . his public prodding was crucial in making the industry do a better job . two decades ago , when the issue on the table was pension accounting , andersen was the only major accounting firm to break with clients and push for good rules . now andersen ' s backbone is open to question . it was evidence that senior people at andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from waste management that led the s . e . c . to bring that suit , which the firm chose to settle without admitting it had done anything wrong . the partner that the s . e . c . says looked the other way at sunbeam is fighting the accusations , and andersen says he acted properly . lynn turner , who was chief accountant of the s . e . c . at the time and is now director of the center for quality financial reporting at colorado state university , says what is happening to andersen now is reminiscent of what happened to coopers & lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a series of highly publicized blown audits . ' ' we got bludgeoned to death in the press , ' ' he said . ' ' people did not even want to see us at their doorsteps . it was brutal , but we deserved it . we had gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls . ' ' by that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending clients and not enough to good accounting . for andersen to avoid that fate , its relatively new chief executive , joseph berardino , who declined to be interviewed for this column , will need to set a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the backbone that mr . spacek epitomized . and then he will have to convince the public of that . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c chase and j . p . morgan ' s paper anniversary a year after the merger , rosy plans meet reality by riva d . atlas 11 / 23 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 5 c . 2001 new york times company when william b . harrison jr . speaks of last year ' s $ 31 billion merger of j . p . morgan and the chase manhattan corporation , he speaks proudly of a deal that he considers to be a capstone to his 34 - year career of helping build a giant of the banking business . ' ' this is the first merger i ' ve been part of , ' ' said mr . harrison , the chief executive of the combined bank , ' ' where i feel our core business is complete . ' ' the chase - j . p . morgan combination helped advance the bank into the investment banking elite , just as mr . harrison intended . but with wall street and the economy in far different places today than they were when the deal was put together , the many mergers , stock sales and other money - making opportunities that were supposed to justify the high - priced acquisition have largely dried up for now . consequently , deal makers and analysts who follow the bank are already speculating that mr . harrison , 58 , may ultimately be compelled to do yet another large deal , this time to diversify his business away from its heavy emphasis on wall street . j . p . morgan chase has won some prominent assignments , like handling the revampings of troubled giants like lucent and , more recently , enron , the beleaguered energy trading company . but while j . p . morgan chase is proud of serving alongside citigroup as both lead lender and adviser to enron on its acquisition by dynegy , the dual role it has worked to achieve sometimes proves complicated for the bank . with enron ' s shares in free fall as more information comes out about its hidden debts , j . p . morgan chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of other banks while simultaneously keeping the merger with dynegy on track . thanks largely to the slump on wall street , j . p . morgan chase ' s profits fell by two - thirds in the third quarter , to $ 449 million from $ 1 . 4 billion in the period a year ago . its stock has dropped 15 percent this year , more than other banks ' shares . the bank ' s stock is ahead of investment banks like goldman sachs , with which j . p . morgan chase increasingly competes . ' ' the jury is still out in many respects on this merger , ' ' said judah kraushaar , an analyst at merrill lynch . nevertheless , he likes j . p . morgan chase ' s stock , he said , because ' ' expectations are very low . ' ' all j . p . morgan chase ' s competitors are suffering from the slowdown on wall street . but some , like citigroup , are better diversified and have greater involvement in old - fashioned consumer banking , which is proving to be a strong moneymaker this year . nearly a third of j . p . morgan chase ' s revenues are consumer - oriented . by contrast , its chief new york rival , citigroup , gets half its revenues from consumer businesses . ' ' the timing of the merger was bad , ' ' said steven wharton , a banking analyst at loomis , sayles donald h . layton , one of two leaders of investment banking ; and james b . lee jr . , the bank ' s senior deal maker . the team also includes dina dublon , the bank ' s chief financial officer . two other senior executives have also lived through big deals . geoffrey t . boisi , the other investment banking leader , was the one - time investment banking chief at goldman , sachs . david a . coulter , in charge of chase ' s retail bank , had been chief executive of bank of america before it was bought by nationsbank . ' ' there aren ' t many teams that have gone through as many mergers as bill harrison and his team , ' ' said mark g . solow , managing principal at garmark advisors , an investment firm , and a former senior executive at chemical . still , ms . dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the j . p . morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations . ' ' in general , mergers are very hard on morale , ' ' she said . ' ' there is no question that this one has a tougher emotional toll . ' ' the bank ' s executives are making the best of a bad situation . they have taken advantage of the slowdown to cut around 8 percent of the combined banks ' staff , or about 2 , 500 more employees than anticipated at the time the merger was announced . many of these job cuts were aimed at high - cost investment bankers : j . p . morgan chase expects that 6 , 000 jobs in its investment banking division will have been eliminated by the end of the year . ' ' we have focused on the tougher jobs to cut , ' ' ms . dublon said . in some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for j . p . morgan chase to overhaul its staff . with fewer jobs available on wall street , mr . shapiro said , the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain about changes in their jobs . ' ' people have fewer options , ' ' he said , ' ' so you have a little more control over the process . ' ' thanks partly to these cuts , the bank estimates the saving from cost cutting will be $ 3 . 6 billion annually , compared with an original projection of $ 2 billion at the time of the merger . the cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits in the bank ' s core businesses . ' ' what we can control and are managing very aggressively is the expenses of the company , ' ' ms . dublon said in a conference call with reporters on oct . 17 , the day earnings were announced . aside from cost cuts , the weakness on wall street makes it hard for the bank ' s executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking , where fees were down 24 percent in the third quarter . but mr . harrison points to market - share gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on wall street . he hopes that when the investment banking business revives , j . p . morgan chase will hold on to these gains . the bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas : mergers and acquisitions , and the underwriting of large investment - grade bond deals . the bank ranked 5 th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising on mergers during the first nine months of 2001 , up from chase ' s 12 th - place finish and j . p . morgan ' s 10 th - place standing during the same period last year , according to thomson financial securities data . the merger and acquisitions business , which chase had been slowly building for years , is stronger following the merger with j . p . morgan , said mr . lee , a vice chairman at the bank . as a result , the bank is able to win assignments providing advice to customers who dealt with the old chase only for loans . mr . lee remains proud of the bank ' s work with enron , the energy company , despite its troubles . j . p . morgan chase , along with citigroup , raised $ 1 billion in bank financing for enron earlier this month . it was also hired to advise the company , which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken over by dynegy . the old chase , long a lending powerhouse , would have had a good shot at leading the bank financing , but an advisory role would have been less certain . mr . lee said the investment banker advising enron came from the old j . p . morgan . but with merger activity slow , there are few such deals to go around . the bank is also proud of its strength in long - term investment - grade bonds , another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger . it moved up to second place in that area so far this year , compared with sixth place a year ago . the bank has taken advantage of a boom in large corporate bond offerings , a surge driven by today ' s low interest rates . in may j . p . morgan chase raised $ 12 billion in bonds for worldcom , the telecommunications company , in the largest corporate debt deal in the united states on record . unfortunately for j . p . morgan chase , the fees for underwriting investment - grade debt are small compared with the money to be earned coordinating offerings of stock , where j . p . morgan chase remains a second - tier competitor . the bank actually lost market share in the rankings for underwriters of stock , falling to 9 th place this year , compared with the old j . p . morgan ' s 6 th - place finish a year ago . ( chase was 11 th . ) mr . harrison said the bank was taking advantage of the slowdown in stock offerings to build momentum slowly in that business . ' ' we think we have a chance in the second half of this year to be in the top five , ' ' he said . given the slowdown , some bankers predict that mr . harrison will ultimately do another deal , either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolster weak areas in investment banking , like the equity division . ' ' the general view is that the combination with j . p . morgan didn ' t do enough , ' ' one investment banker said . mr . harrison disagrees : ' ' i don ' t feel , ' ' he said , ' ' we need to do another large deal to be successful . ' ' photo : william b . harrison jr . , the chief executive , says he has no doubts about the wisdom of forming j . p . morgan chase , even though the the economy has slowed since then . ' ' i can ' t tell you how happy i am about having done this merger , ' ' he said . ( associated press ) chart : ' ' still looking for the right mix ' ' when j . p . morgan and chase announced their merger in september 2000 , the combination ' s strength in investment banking seemed sure to be successful . but the bank ' s stock has suffered with wall street ' s slump , and its more consumer - oriented and better - diversified rival , citigroup , has fared better . graph tracks the daily closing prices of citigroup and j . p . morgan chase shares from september 2000 through november 2001 . a different blend of banking based on revenue , before overhead expenses ( first nine months of 2001 ) . j . p . morgan chase * consumer and small business : 32 % investment management and private : 9 % corporate and investment : 58 % citigroup consumer and small business : 54 % investment management and private : 4 % corporate and investment : 42 % * does not add to 100 because of rounding .

"" you ' ve got to believe there is that possibility . there is a 90 percent spread on the deal , "" said one analyst . "" there ' s unquestionably continued malaise in enron ' s core business and dynegy has left itself open to renegotiate with enron . "" ubs warburg analyst ron barone on wednesday wrote in a research report that the likelihood was "" soaring "" that dynegy might discover a material adverse change . enron spokeswoman karen denne said that , to her knowledge , dynegy was not renegotiating the terms of the acquisition . she repeated that enron was working on obtaining an additional $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in private equity funding to help shore up the balance sheet . dynegy spokesman john sousa said due diligence was continuing and said the company remains optimistic about the merger . traders fearing renegotiation enron ' s recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the crown jewel of enron that dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth - quarter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability . continued losses there would remove a key attraction for dynegy . electricity traders said the latest developments are making it seem more likely that dynegy will renegotiate the deal or back out entirely , a move they said would leave enron vulnerable to creditors and a possible bankruptcy . this week rating agency fitch investors said that if dynegy stepped away from the merger , enron ' s credit situation seemed untenable and a bankruptcy filing was highly possible . traders , speaking on condition on anonymity , said they expected dynegy to scramble over the weekend to narrow the growing share price gap . enron ' s depleted market value and the shrinking volume in its enrononline trading system makes it more likely dynegy could pull out , traders said . meanwhile , energy traders reiterated that they would shy away from long - term deals with enron unless they received substantial assurances the company ' s credit rating would soon improve . enron ' s bonds on friday were again talked at junk - bond levels , but even lower than before . enron ' s 6 . 4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and its 6 . 75 percent notes were bid friday at 57 cents on the dollar , down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on wednesday , according to a trader . the notes yield to maturity a respective 21 . 5 percent and 17 percent . its 20 - year zero - coupon convertible bonds fell about 1 cent on the dollar to just over 33 cents . enron is hovering at the edge of investment - grade as the three main credit trading agencies consider whether to cut them again , and some observers wonder how enron has avoided it .

' s plan to buy compaq computer corp . will , if finalized , result in 15 , 000 layoffs at the two companies . compaq also announced 8 , 000 layoffs worldwide in july . "" it ' s fair to say that the potential layoffs at enron and the layoffs at continental , taken alone , are negative factors , although probably small in the grand scope of the houston economy , "" said phil scheps , director of houston ' s finance and administration department . since last month when enron became a target of a securities and exchange commission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships , the energy giant ' s market share has steadily eroded . while neither enron nor dynegy have given any indication of the number of layoffs that could hit houston , barton smith , director of the institute for regional forecasting at the university of houston , said the layoffs "" will be spread out over a long period of time and will not be excessive . "" robin kapiloff , an analyst at moody ' s investors service , said the city ' s efforts to diversify its economy over the past decade will protect its revenue collections , even as some of the city ' s biggest employers suffer . "" we ' re watching to see where things go now , "" she said . alex fraser , a director at standard & poor ' s , said the ratings agency isn ' t concerned about houston ' s credit position at this point . "" while enron is certainly a large player and prominent corporation , we ' re unclear on what the impact would be . "" while the fourth largest city in the country experienced a bit of a slowdown since the sept . 11 attacks , houston has outperformed the rest of the nation . with a tax base of $ 87 . 3 billion in 2001 , houston is also buffered by the texas medical center , the city ' s largest employer . next year the city ' s tax base is estimated to grow to $ 95 billion . still , the national recession , energy price weakness in general , and the initial loss of consumer confidence related to the attacks has caused the city to reduce its estimate of sales tax growth to 1 . 5 percent from 5 percent . that revised estimate equals a $ 13 million reduction in the city ' s $ 1 . 4 billion budget . but the city ' s property tax revenue has not been affected . only a small change in property tax collections is expected in 2002 because valuations are based on jan . 1 data and for most of 2001 , real estate growth was very large , scheps said . while recent economic indicators appear positive , and consumer confidence has quickly rebounded , a better read on the strength of houston ' s tax revenue collections will be available in february when the city receives data for the december holiday season , scheps said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dabhol pwr confirms arbitrator panel mtg in singapore sat 11 / 23 / 2001 dow jones international news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones dow jones newswires ; 91 -

dollar deal , friday ' s wall street journal reported . the pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of enron ( ene ) shares and the mounting financial problems at the houston energy - trading company , the nation ' s biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas . during the past month , enron has taken a $ 1 billion write - off of assets , revised downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . the problems have been due largely to dealings enron had with private partnerships , run by some of its own executives , under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . in an sec filing monday , enron disclosed hundreds of millions of potential additional write - offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than $ 2 billion in loans by the end of the year . as of 4 p . m . wednesday in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares fell $ 1 . 98 , or 28 % , to $ 5 . 01 each after having dropped 23 % tuesday . in excess of 115 million shares traded wednesday , more than four times the volume of any other big board stock . enron ' s bonds also again traded sharply lower , market observers said . the turmoil spilled over to dynegy ' s stock , which also was among the most actively traded on the new york stock exchange . as of 4 p . m . wednesday , dynegy ( dyn ) shares fell $ 1 . 94 to $ 39 . 76 each . on wednesday , dynegy issued a statement in which chairman and chief executive chuck watson said his company was working "" to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement "" though it continued to perform "" due diligence "" on enron . under the merger agreement , dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if enron ' s financial and legal problems become severe enough . however , some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so - called material adverse change clauses . they point to a decision earlier this year by a delaware chancery court judge who forced tyson foods inc . to complete a planned purchase of ibp inc . even though tyson , a springdale , ark . , food - products company , had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in ibp ' s earnings and accounting problems at an ibp unit . dynegy officials didn ' t return calls seeking comment . to complete the deal , two - thirds of dynegy shareholders and a majority of enron shareholders would have to give their approval . no dates for those votes have been set . one person familiar with the merger plans said the sec filing monday by enron contained information dynegy hadn ' t known about . dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company ' s due diligence , this person said . it couldn ' t be determined what the new information was . the merger agreement , announced nov . 9 , calls for dynegy to exchange 0 . 2685 share for each of enron ' s roughly 850 million fully diluted shares , giving the purchase a value of about $ 9 billion at dynegy ' s current stock price . however , from a price standpoint , the deal is appearing less attractive to dynegy . on the day of the merger announcement , enron shares were trading at about $ 8 . 63 each , or about 83 % of the purchase price under the exchange ratio . as of wednesday , enron ' s market price was only about 47 % of the merger - formula price . such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement , when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading relatively close to the offering price . sentiment among wall street analysts also is turning against the merger . initially , many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue enron and provide a major boost to houston - based dynegy . dynegy and enron officials have predicted that the merger , supposed to be completed late next year , would significantly and immediately increase dynegy ' s earnings . now analysts are challenging that assumption . ron barone , managing director at ubs warburg llc , said he believes that because of enron ' s financial problems , a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than dynegy would have by itself . mr . barone said he thinks a "" likely scenario "" is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0 . 15 dynegy share for each enron share . copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ? 2000 dow jones financial desk employees ' lawuit says enron hurt retirement funds courts : the suit claims the energy firm urged workers to invest in company stock just before it plunged . from associated press 11 / 23 / 2001 los angeles times home edition c -

worker steve lacey . enron shares have plunged more than 90 % over the last several months since the departure of the company ' s chief executive and an accounting controversy that prompted the firm to restate its earnings since 1997 , eliminating more than $ 580 million of reported income . steve berman , managing partner for the law firm of hagens berman in seattle , said enron touted the value of its shares and encouraged employees to put their entire portfolio into enron stock . enron officials didn ' t emphasize the risk and instead painted the situation as positive , especially when the company ' s stock began to slide , said berman , who is hoping to get the suit certified as a class action . berman wants to prove that the company ' s 401 ( k ) plan executives failed to act responsibly when they knew about serious business problems . he ' s also hoping to break new legal ground with his case . the lawsuit is patterned after a case against lucent technologies in which lucent employees sued their employer this summer for matching their 401 ( k ) contributions with company stock that tanked . that case is still in litigation . earlier this year , rinard , 54 , had $ 472 , 000 in his enron 401 ( k ) plan , which had been growing for 21 years . today , his plan is worth about $ 40 , 000 . enron gives its employees their 401 ( k ) match in company stock . in january , enron was trading for $ 84 . 87 . wednesday it closed at $ 5 . 01 a share on the new york stock exchange . the problem was compounded when many employees , including rinard , saw enron ' s stock doing so well that they decided to put their entire account into enron stock . enron executives had talked about how the stock price was poised to climb above $ 100 a share , rinard told the houston chronicle . in addition , enron employees were not allowed to make trades in the 401 ( k ) plan for about a month , starting oct . 17 . that was the day after enron surprised the market with the news it was taking a $ 1 . 01 -

- oregon ' s largest utility , portland general electric , faces an uncertain future as its parent enron fights for its life amid a deepening financial crisis , industry experts said wednesday . another oregon utility , northwest natural gas , is due to file next week with state regulators for approval to take over portland general . those same regulators could soon be faced with a similar application from dynegy as part of a still - pending deal to acquire cash - strapped enron . if enron were to file for bankruptcy before portland general has been sold , its future could be thrown into the hands of a texas bankruptcy court , experts said . northwest natural gas agreed oct . 8 to acquire portland general for around $ 1 . 8 billion , plus about $ 1 . 1 billion in assumed debt and preferred stock . a month later , enron announced it had agreed to be acquired by houston - based dynegy . "" we ' ve been watching this from afar to see how it could impact that sale ( portland general ' s acquisition by northwest natural gas ) , "" said roy hemmingway , chairman of the oregon public utility commission . "" we have authority if that sale doesn ' t go through to rule on whether dynegy can take over enron , "" he said . ratings agency fitch last week cut portland general ' s debt ratings due to "" uncertainty at its parent enron . "" wednesday , the same agency said a bankruptcy filing by enron was "" highly possible "" if the proposed rescue by dynegy collapses . "" we haven ' t seen any credit problems so far , and portland general isn ' t in the market ( buying power for its customers ) right now in a big way , "" hemmingway said . however , he noted that , "" if they really were unable to conduct their business because they were not creditworthy we would have to use whatever instruments are available "" to make sure service to customers is maintained . earlier this year , california was forced to take over buying power for the pg & e unit of pacific gas & electric and edison international subsidiary southern california edison after the two utilities saw their credit ratings cut to junk status . federal regulators have insisted the sellers of wholesale power have the right to sell to a creditworthy buyer . california ' s largest utility , pacific gas & electric , chose to file for bankruptcy because of its mounting debt . in a parallel , consumer advocates fear the fate of the biggest utility in neighboring oregon could end up in the hands of a bankruptcy judge . hemmingway said the oregon public utility commission recently had granted portland general a rate increase and the utility has "" plenty of cash flow currently to handle its obligations . "" "" this is nothing like california where that was not the case , "" he said . northwest natural gas , which is also based in portland , has set a target of filing next wednesday with the oregon commission to take over the utility , spokesman steve sechrist said . "" we have no concerns whatsoever at this point . the deal is moving forward and there is no reason we can see why it should not "" he said , noting the delay to the filing was the result of the complexities of the acquisition . jason eisdorfer , a lawyer for the citizens ' utility board of oregon , said major questions would be raised if enron went under before the deal were completed .

' ' microsoft also wants to deliver consumer services like music and video and software updates , which require fast internet access for smooth downloads . the company originally began a service with northpoint communications group inc . , a now - bankrupt provider of fast web access . microsoft has also had difficulty finding partners among cable companies who use their networks for high - speed service . now houston - based enron , which agreed in june to provide the backbone for a nationwide expansion of msn ' s service , is suing . enron claimed in its lawsuit that it isn ' t required to deliver broadband services if microsoft hasn ' t first provided a billing and ordering system that the biggest software company agreed to build . enron , which is being acquired by rival dynegy inc . , recently disclosed debts of $ 9 . 15 billion due by 2003 and restated earnings for four years . slower expansion msn has been selling high - speed access in 14 states under partnership with qwest communications international inc . for the last few months . msn has begun the planned service expansion outside of those states by working with enron competitors that msn marketing director bob visse declined to name . the company is also talking to enron , he said . enron didn ' t return calls for comment . because of the enron suit the expansion is moving slower than expected , visse said . since oct . 25 , msn has added service in los angeles , san francisco , san diego and sacramento , california , and houston , dallas , san antonio and austin , texas , giving microsoft a total of about 30 markets rather than 45 . plans to expand marketing are also on hold , visse said . ` ` it is very unfortunate that we are in the position we are in , ' ' said microsoft chief executive steve ballmer . top u . s . internet service provider america online , owned by aol time warner inc . , has also been slow to get into the high - speed market , analysts said . that doesn ' t mean microsoft is in the clear . laszlo said both msn and aol might pay for their sluggishness with tougher competition from third - place earthlink inc . and from cable and telephone companies that have more experience selling high - speed internet access . america online has more than 31 million subscribers to msn ' s 7 million . earthlink inc . has 4 . 77 million subscribers . laszlo doesn ' t think msn or america online can build the kind of lead in the high - speed market that america online has in the slower dial - up access market . ` not a permanent blow ' not that anyone need worry about microsoft . msn will be able to expand its fast internet access business even with the delays , laszlo said . ` ` they are already late in the broadband market so this means they get a little later , ' ' he said . ` ` but broadband will continue to grow over the next few years and this is definitely not a permanent blow . ' ' analysts also say microsoft still needs to find a cable partner that will let msn use its network to sell fast access over cable lines . cable is more popular than dsl with customers looking for fast web service . the five largest cable providers control 51 percent of the u . s . high - speed internet market . the five largest sellers of access via phone lines and dsl technology account for about 33 percent , according to market researcher ars inc . microsoft msn vice president yusuf mehdi said last month the company may be interested in an investment in at & t corp . ' s cable - television unit , which at section a corrections 11 / 22 / 2001 the new york times page 2 , column 4 c . 2001 new york times company because of an editing error , an article in world business yesterday about the enron corporation ' s prospects for selling its interest in the dabhol power project in india misstated the size of its stake . it is 65 percent , not 70 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .",Safe Email

Date: Not suppliedI've been in Austin all weekend. On Friday, I spoke at the University of Texas 
about EFF issues. Jon Lebkowsky was there -- hell, he organized it -- and he 
blogged the hell out of the talk:     Entertainment industry has tradition of attacking technology: the piano 
    roll, the radio (sued by vaudeville), television (would destroy cinema!), 
    ""the Betamax affair""... the latter being the first consumer VCR. In Betamax 
    case, argued that the ability to make a full copy of a broadcast work would 
    not be a fair use (in terms of copyright). It was illegal enough that the 
    VCR should be kept off the market, they argued. The Supreme Court got the 
    case, and the thing that shook out of it was the Betamax principle: a 
    technology is legal so long as it has substantial non-infringeing uses. 
    This principle is under attack.     Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998. Illegal to defeat a copyright 
    measure. Regionalization system for DVDs. This is a control that limits 
    distribution. John Johansen in Norway figured out how to break the content 
    scrambling system and allows you to move from one region to another, 
    override copy protection. It was called DeCSS - Johansen is facing trial 
    for creating a piece of code.  Link[1] (Wes blogged it, too[2]) Discuss[3][1] http://www.weblogsky.com/2002_09_01_blarchive.html#85500802

"Cheers, Adam.Perhaps people are starting to notice how profit motive drains the 
meaning out of their lives. Kinda sucks to be an ant farming for the 
corporate lords. Funny how most of the rest of the world is more and 
more apprehensive towards American Democracy.I just went to DC for the first time. I was awestruck by the 
monuments, the words of Thomas Jefferson, the Spirit of Democracy set 
in stone. Amazing to think that in little more than 200 years our 
government could be so far removed from those honorable principles. 
Adam Smith presumed that the marketplace would regulate itself 
through morality, good faith, and responsibility. Corporate America 
seems to feel that those principles stand in the way of making the 
real bucks. How much more can they co-opt and commodify? Get your 
copyrights in quick so you can hold on to your piece of the pie.

"sum : linguistics and imperialism some two weaks ago i posted a question on whether linguistics has it 's origin in imperialistic effords . i pointed to cases like arabic grammar , latin and sanskrit . ( the sanskrit case quite obviously did not fit ) o . k . , i put it in a provokative fashion , formulated more sharply than i really had it in mind . the reactions were vivid . the case of india ( sanskrit ) : it was pointed out that in the sanskrit case the concern was to preserve the "" correct "" language which was in danger of beeing lost otherwise which would have made religious texts unreadable . ( michael newman , karl v . teeter , mechthild reh , european cases : generally , the intention was more the emancipation from latin and / or to give the own country a status as respectable as the roman empire . ( michael newman , mechthild reh ) spanish : the first grammar was published 1492 , before the the concest of america , at the time of the fall of the kingdom of granada . ( michael newman ) nynorsk : the rise and conception of nynorsk ( landsmaal ) in norway in the 1800s was part of the nationalist reaction to danish rule ( imperialism ) . that 's a long story , but nynorsk never succeeded in dominating norway , i ' m afraid . ( jon hareide aarbakke ) linguistics as an emancipatory efford : ( mechthild reh , see gupta below , ) the term "" imperialistic "" : > i think it is inappropriate to use terms like > "" imperialist "" that only make sense once the conquest and > subjugation of > other peoples came to be seen as perhaps somewhat unethical . no > one at the times you were speaking of would have done that , so > the term is anachronistic . ( michael newman ) are linguists imperialists ? several people asked wheather i was thinking in that direction . i certainly do n't ! ! linguistics can help to answer lots of questions ( see the greek sophistic tradition ) . the question was more to what made any linguistic attempt suddenly beeing successful on a national level . thus , my idea refers more to linguistics beeing ( mis ) used than beeing evil . ( actually , i ' m a linguist as well ) . general aggreement : > grammar books in english came into being in the > 18th century , together with the early dictionaries , and > most people say that this is to do with the insecurity > of middle-class english speakers faced with a language > that was being latinised . and interestingly , the > british ventures to india and north america i think > also coincided with the period . ( i ' m afraid i have n't > really got the actual dates , so what i ' m giving is > from memory . ) > peter tan however , as anthea fraser gupta points out , > spence ( 18c orthoepist ) was a millenarian and an early socialist . he believed that if > everyone pronounced correctly , social discrimination based on accent > would disappear and everyone would be equal . then the millenium would > come , etc . > it seems to me that in general , conditions which favor imperialism > in a society might also favor the growth of all kinds of studies in > that society - - a society which can afford to work on expansion can > afford to support people who are functioning as intellectuals . > i also > think it 's natural that when a society goes through an imperialistic > phase , all kinds of resources which exist in that society are bent to > the purpose of supporting the imperialist expansion . marion kee > i 'd heard theories that prescriptionist grammar arose in the united > states as a way of reclaiming the diminishing boundries between the > social classes . an idiolect today can certainly reflect social class , > so i was curious about the early works . i found in these early english > grammars much more reference to religion and to past glories of the > language / english people than i would have guessed . in the 1700 's , it > appears that the justification of using well-constructed language > was that language was ( 1 ) an hommage to god , since most early > grammarians > apparently believed that language was a divine gift and the way to > separate man and beast , and ( 2 ) that the earlier idea of latin or > greek being a near-perfectly constructed language had shifted over to > english ; they believe that proper care of english had succeed in nearly > perfecting it , and the efforts must continue . tom mcclive > when a new science > is developped , the state always wants to use it in an imperialistic > way . the origin _ per se _ of the science is not imp . but its first > use ( the oldest we can still observe , at least ) is for the good of > the state . marc a . belanger tips for further reading : pennycook , alastair . 1989 . the concept of method , interested knowledge , and the politics of language teaching . tesol quarterly 23 : 589 . transactions of the philological society 1974 , 33-64 ( under the name anthea frser shields ) university of chicago press , _ the politics of linguistics _ .",Safe Email

RARP to Bootparams for you. Very simple. This script takes a -d option, to boot via DHCP also. On the negative
side, Sun's terminal handling leaves a lot to be desired - it won't work
properly on a Wyse 120+ for instance, no matter what emulation mode the
Wyse is trying to do. To do PC netbooting properly, you need an motherbard with a PXE BIOS.
Then you are flying. Heh, how hard would it be to get a PC with an OpenBoot prom ?Kate

"summary : borrowings or replacements of ' ear ' some time i posted a query as to whether the term for ' ear ' is ever borrowed , or at least replaced by a neologism : here is a summary of the responses , for all of which i am very grateful and which i will again acknowledge in print , as the occasion presents ( an earlier summary contained other relevant discussion of the same topic ) : benji wald ( ibenawj @ mvs . oac . ucla . edu ) reports that in bantu the near-universal word for "" ear "" has the root * to . however , in sabaki ( kenyan coastal bantu , e . g . , swahili , pokomo , miji kenda ) the word is * sikilo ( e . g . , swahil sikio ) . this is based on the root * sikil "" hear "" ( e . g . swahili sikia ' hear ' ) ; the final - o is a bantu nominaliser . the most widespread bantu word for "" hear "" is not related to * sikil but has the morpheme * gu . thus in most of bantu the roots for "" ear "" and "" hear "" are not related . he also notes that some cushitic languages also derive ' ear ' from ' hear ' , somali deg "" ear "" deg-eyso "" hear "" , and suspects that the sabaki bantu construction for "" ear "" came about through contact , probably from cushitic . * * to this i would add that this also gives an example of replacement within afro - asiatic , of which cushitic is a part , since clearly this word is not related to , for example , the semitic word ( hebrew ozen , etc . ) - - amr * * bruce connell ( connellb @ vax . ox . ac . uk ) reports that , according to wilkins , david ( 1993 ) from part to person : natural tendencies of semantic change and the search for cognates . cognitive anthropology research group , max planck institute for psycholinguistics , working paper no . 23 : a ) semantic shift of ' ear ' to ' head ' is attested in bantu ; languages unspecified , but guthrie ( 1967-71 ) is ultimate source . b ) in dravidian , ' earring ' shifts to ' ear ' ; again languages unspecified , burrow and emaneau ( 1961 ) is ultimate source . i have also independently , i . e . , extra - linguist - ically , found out that laurent sagart argues that bai ( a minority language of china , i believe , whose genetic affiliations are controversial ) borrowed its word for ' ear ' from chinese , but that is not universally accepted . likewise , i have found an article by gregersen which assumes without detailed discussion that the vietnamese word for ' ear ' is borrowed from austronesian ( while this does not appear to be generally accepted either , it presumably at least indicates that the word in question is not a reflex of the mon - khmer prototype , and hence would be a replacement , but i have not yet checked this out ) . finally , i realized what i had been forgetting all along , namely , that many ( or is it all ? ) indo - aryan languages ( from sanskrit on down ) have a word for ' ear ' which is clearly not the indo - european word for ' ear ' , and hence a particularly clear example of a replacement . i thus still do not have an example of ' ear ' being borrowed which could be considered to be established beyond reasonable doubt , and would appreciate any references to such . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = in addition , i omitted the following response from my earlier summary of responses to a more general query about the borrowing of body part terms : h . a . y . wolf @ stud . let . ruu . nl ( henk wolf ) : dutch _ neus _ ( nose ) in west frisian has become an alternative to the native _ noas _ ( see breuker , p . et al ( 1984 ) , foar de taalspegel ; koart oersjoch fan holl ^ anske ynsl ^ upsels yn it frysk , ljouwert : afuk ) .",Safe Email

obvious with extreme choices of numbers, but it is also true 
for any choice of N and H, if unrealistic totals distract you.Further, and I was hoping this would be clear without saying
so outright, this model actually approximates the cliche 
""common wisdom"" about per-gender sexual behavior, if you 
reverse the male and female roles.Those stereotypes are: that more men than women seek multiple

to jump in with a patronizing ""DUH!!""? If you were talking about fuzzy, typical behavior, would you have 
huffed and puffed with the words ""perfectly obvious"" and ""exactly, 
precisely identical""? If your concern was with the ""typical"", why didn't you adopt the

definition which allowed you to interject ""DUH!!"" and mock an

Some Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than GoodSeptember 10, 2002
By MARY DUENWALD 
 Friends are supposed to be good for you. In recent years,
scientific research has suggested that people who have
strong friendships experience less stress, they recover
more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live
longer than the friendless. They are even less susceptible
to the common cold, studies show. But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,
insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too
much advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling
attention to the negative health effects of bad friends. ""Friendship is often very painful,"" said Dr. Harriet
Lerner, a psychologist and the author of ""The Dance of
Connection."" ""In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,
envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will
rear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing
is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this
is bad for my health and I'm disbanding it."" Another book, ""When Friendship Hurts,"" by Dr. Jan Yager, a
sociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,
advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.
""There's this myth that friendships should last a
lifetime,"" Dr. Yager said. ""But sometimes it's better that
they end."" That social scientists would wait until now to spotlight
the dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering
that they have only recently paid close attention to
friendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -
between siblings or parents and children - have been seen
as more important. Of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead
to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And
children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go
bad. As a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.
Lerner said, ""Never once have I had anyone write and say my
best friend hits me."" Dr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the
University of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,
like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the
role of friends in emotional and physical health. ""Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for
stability the way it was in the past, and because people
are less likely to be living with or near extended family
members, people are shifting their focus to friendships as
a way of building community and finding intimacy,"" said Dr.
Fehr, the author of ""Friendship Processes."" Until the past couple of years, the research on friendship
focused on its health benefits. ""Now we're starting to look
at it as a more full relationship,"" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,
a professor of psychology at Florida International
University in Miami. ""Like marriage, friendship also has
negative characteristics."" The research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet
measured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.
So far they have only, through surveys and interviews,
figured out that it is a significant problem. The early
research, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a
friend can be more devastating than experts had thought. How can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by
drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised
pursuit. ""When you think of people who were friends at
Enron,"" she added, ""you can see how friendship can support
antisocial behavior."" Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. ""When friends
split up,"" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of
psychology at the University of South Carolina, ""it is
often in cases where one has shared personal information or
secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.""
Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend
suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. ""It's
more than just pulling away,"" she said. ""The silent
treatment is actually malicious."" At least as devastating is an affair with the friend's
romantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.
Lerner's patients. ""I would not encourage her to hang in
there and work this one out,"" Dr. Lerner said. A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults
the other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who
responded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship
described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her
""a derogatory name."" The woman, now 32, was so devastated
that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with
people ever since, Dr. Yager said. Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,
but it is ""more insidious,"" Dr. Yager said. ""Some people
constantly set up their friends,"" she explained. ""They'll
have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or
she finds out."" Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme
kinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the
only ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying
the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is
overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person
who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and
the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. Most common is the promise breaker. ""This includes everyone
from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but
something always comes up at the last minute to someone who
promises to be there for you when you need them, but then
isn't,"" Dr. Yager said. Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,
when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons
to dislike the other one. ""With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to
discover there's something important they don't like about
the other person,"" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.
""One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other
person is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,
it may take even more time for one person to meet the
other's dislike criteria."" Whether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,
""depends on how large the injury is."" ""Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let
something go,"" she added. ""It's also an act of maturity
sometimes to accept another person's limitations."" Acceptance should come easier among friends than among
spouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one
friend and do not need a full range of emotional support
from each one. But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where
one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the
friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is
to pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal
or intimate details of life, and start being too busy to
get together, ever. ""It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,
but only one to end it,"" Dr. Yager said. Friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far
easier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also
comparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a
bad friendship should leave a person with more time and
appreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. ""It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have
them in order while you're healthy and your life and work
are going well,"" she said. ""Because when a crisis hits,
when someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your
health insurance, when the universe gives you a crash
course in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and
life-preserving good friendship is.""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/10/health/psychology/10FRIE.html?ex=1032684795&ei=1&en=2a88a6d1b985c977HOW TO ADVERTISE

"Ok, Iknow this is blatantly OT but I'm beginning to go insane.
Had an old Dell Dimension XPS sitting in the corner and decided to
put it to use, I know it was working pre being stuck in the
corner, but when I plugged it in, hit the power nothing happened.
I opened her up and had a look and say nothing much. A little orange
LED comes on when I plug her in but that's it, after some googling
I found some reference to re-seating all the parts, but no change.
The problem I'm having is that since the power supply is some Dell
specific one, ATX block with what looks like one of the old AT
power connectors, I cant figure out weather this is a Mobo prob
or a PSU prob. Just to futily try and drag this back OT, I want
to install Linux on it when I get it working. If anyone knows
what the problem might be give me a shout.Cheers,

 Scissors are a snip for Third World
 From Richard Owen in Rome
 
 
 
 IT IS one of the unanswered questions of the past year: what happens to the
 millions of nail scissors confiscated by airport security officials from
 passengersÂ’ hand luggage? Most are thrown away or recycled after being seized
 as part of security measures since September 11. But an enterprising chaplain
 is sending them to Catholic missionaries for distribution to Third World
 hospitals and clinics. In theory travellers who have left nail scissors, nail
 files, corkscrews or manicure sets from their hand luggage can arrange for
 them to be returned. In practice many just shrug and leave the scissors by the
 X-ray scanners. 
 
 Father Arturo Rossini, chaplain of Malpensa airport in Milan, said that
 scissors were costly or unavailable in many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin
 America. 
 
 He told Corriere della Sera that he had Â“plucked up the courageÂ” to ask the
 authorities if he could have the confiscated scissors. With the help of a
 retired airport policeman, he had packaged 60,000 nail scissors and manicure
 sets, using the airport chapel as a packing centre. 
 
 Packages were shipped in aircraft holds to Peru, Brasil, India, Mozambique,
 Argentina, Zambia and Kenya. Â“In such countries, what we think of as a
 personal grooming accessory can be a vital tool.Â” 
 
 The idea has been taken up at other Italian airports.

                  URGENT AND NOBLE PROPOSALATTN: DIRECTOR.
DEAR ,I wish to extend my greeting to you and your entire
family. I got your contact from the ivoirian chamber
of commerce, I prayed over it and selected your name
among other names because of its esteeming
nature.Morever,after my strong prayers and fasting,
God reveals to me that you are straight forward,
Honest and GodÂ’s person.
This is the reason I never waste time to propose you
this business for our mutual benefits. Infact, You
will never regret it provided you give me your
possible best cooperate hand, Believe me.I am MARTIN FRANCIS, A cote dÂ’ivoire national and the
only child of late Mr and Mrs FRANCIS. My late father
was the former financial controller of CÃ´te dÂ’Ivoire
telecommunication (CITELCOM). My father died due to
the heat of political crisis in my country recently
last years.But,I am motherless since,before my fathers
late and the death of my mother on 26 SEPTEMBER 1993
was as a result of spiritual attack by our family
member who hated her just because of my fathers
wealth.
Moreover, they tried their own part as well against my
father and myself but negative because God almighty
is available at our side. Infact God is wonderful.
Although, before the death of my father in one of the
private hospital here, he secretly revealed to me
specifically on family matters and mostly the safety
of his monies us$16,500,000.00 (sixteen million,five 
hundred thousand united states dollars) which he
deposited in a bank here in my county Abidjan, 
CÃ´te dÂ’Ivoire and used my name,MARTIN FRANCIS as the
next of kin for the deposits. This amount was accrued
from an over-invoiced contract award for the
construction of an underground telephone network to
replace the former in the new city (Yamoussoukro) and
other major cities also for installation of the
microwave station awarded to my late father,Mr JOSEPH
FRANCIS in 1999 to expatiate companies. In fact, after
the finished payment of  contract workers, my late
father deposited this fund in a bank as the full
beneficiary contractor of the said company (CITELCOM)
this is the fund I want to transferred to your account
as the beneficiary contractor due for payment,providedyou cooperate.Therefore I am seeking your full and
urgent  assistance for the telegraphic transfer of
this sixteen million and five hundred thousand united
states dollars, us$16,500.000 US dollars to your
designated account for a very good business investment
in your country as due to the instruction my father
gave to me before he late. What I require from you are
as follows.1.Your private telephone and fax number for easy and
strict communication
2.Your bank particular for smooth and successful
remittance of this monies to your nominated account
3.You have to make necessary arrangement for me to
meet with you immediately the monies is been
transferred in your account and confirmed by you.
4.You have to secure a college for me in your country
to further my education. 
5.You will have to be my guardian and part of the
joint venture investment when I get to your country.Furthermore, my late father had instructed me to offer
20 % of the total sum to the person who is to assist
me out for the transferring of this fund.Moreover, I wish to assure you that this transaction
would be concluded within the next(3)days you signify
interest to assist me out.I suggest that this
transaction should be handled in strict confidence
because I have work out fine every modalities
concerning the transfer of this fund. 
Please and please, kindly hasten up the arrangement as
quickly as possible because my late father instructed
me not to invest this monies in this country CÃ´te-
dÂ’Ivoire. That I should invest abroad of my choice for
the benefit of myself and for security reasons.Thank very much in anticipation of your
acknowledgement of this business proposal and do not
hesitate to contact me immediately you receive this

"direct access 8 / 10 / 01 below is a brief summary of the main issues regarding direct access . we will continue to the follow the progress and keep you updated . summary : direct access was designed to break utility monopolies and was a key component of california ' s 1996 deregulation law . under this concept , all customers could directly access an energy provider other than their regulated utility . the debate over direct access is at the heart of a complicated attempt to solve california ' s costly power crisis . it will determine whether businesses , with residential customers , pay for the bulk of the state ' s future energy purchases . it also could determine whether southern california edison , the state ' s cash - strapped no . 2 utility , will avoid bankruptcy , and whether deregulation will survive in any form . big businesses , free - market advocates and alternative energy providers have lobbied state legislators to find a way to keep so - called "" direct access "" . now , as the state prepares to sell $ 13 . 4 billion in bonds to begin paying off its debt , legislators and energy officials say they must prevent big businesses from wiggling out of that obligation by closing off their direct - access escape route . regulators are concerned that if businesses flee the system , the state will be stuck with too much electricity under long - term electricity contracts through 2021 . that would mean residential ratepayers would be stuck paying the bulk of the $ 43 billion in future power costs , a point that has enraged consumer groups . currently , only about 88 , 000 customers buy their energy through direct access ( per cec statistics ) , including about 10 , 000 large commercial / industrial customers , and about 78 , 000 residences . alternative service providers shifted most of their customers back to california ' s primary utility suppliers ( socal ed . , pg & e , sdg & e ) earlier this year when prices skyrocketed and they could no longer compete with utility rates capped by the legislature . california legislators argue that direct access is the keystone of the latest edison bailout plan , sponsored by assembly speaker pro tem fred keeley . under the plan , the 3 , 600 largest businesses would agree to pay $ 3 . 1 billion of edison ' s debts over 15 years . in exchange , businesses would be allowed to secure their own power contracts by 2003 , but not without first paying an "" exit fee . "" the fees and which parties would be exempt remain undetermined , however , they would include a surcharge or a complicated calculation in which businesses would pay a percentage of future energy purchases . it is likely that whatever compromise legislators are able to reach regarding direct access , california ' s business community will have extreme difficulty accepting the terms . to ensure their efforts at resolving the direct access dilemma and abate fears of a collapsing state budget , lawmakers have gone so far as to introduce two bills , ( one sponsored by sen . bowen and defeated in july , and a second by assemblyman dave kelley , ) that would rescind language in previous legislation that authorized the public utilities commission to block direct access . the california puc has thus far stayed a decision on the matter , but is expected to rule by august 23 rd . complicating the issue is wall street . the state ' s bankers , led by j . p morgan , are nervous about selling as much as $ 13 . 4 billion in planned state bonds if businesses ( currently the largest ratepayers in the state , after governments ) find a way out of the system . the bonds are meant to repay the state for $ 8 . 2 billion in power - buying costs so far this year and to cover some future costs . business and residential electricity customers would repay the bonds through a surcharge on their utility bills . if businesses were allowed to sign on with outside energy providers , that revenue stream would be in jeopardy .",Safe Email

MACHINIMA  My reputation for small errors continues to grow (I am
keeping quiet about the big ones) with a misprint in last week's
piece on this word. In the sentence giving the etymology, of all
places, I misspelled it ""mechanima"", thus confusing everybody.APPETITE OVER TIN CUP  Several replies came in about this saying,
confirming that variations on it and other ways of saying ""head
over heels"" are widely known, especially ""ass over appetite"" from
the US, where ""appetite"" may be a transferred term for the mouth.
But the specific form that Maria Jessup Robinson was asking about,
""appetite over tin cup"", seems not to be known much at all. It
would seem to be a conflation of the British expression ""arse over
teakettle"" and the American ""ass over appetite"" (note my deliberate
use of the two spellings of ""arse"" here!). The saying was probably
modified because at the time it was created a tea kettle was an
item less common in America than in Britain. Even in Britain these
days it is obsolete as a fixed term except within this expression,
which itself is now not very common.BUMBERSHOOT  Several subscribers have pointed out that the word is
in the lyric of a song sung by Dick Van Dyke in the film ""Chitty
Chitty Bang Bang"":  Me ol' bam-boo, me ol' bam-boo
  You'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo
  You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
  But you'd better never bother with me ol' bam-booIt may be one reason why some Americans, not familiar with the word
in their own country, have come to believe it must be British.OLOGIES AND ISMS  The publication date of my book has been moved
back a week in the UK to 29 August. A review by Jonathon Green is
scheduled for the issue of 31 August (assuming nobody changes the
date again). See  for
more details and UK ordering information.
2. Turns of Phrase: Asian Brown Cloud
-------------------------------------------------------------------
As though we didn't have enough to worry about weather-wise, what
with global warming, the ozone hole, and the new El NiÃ±o season,
UN scientists have now identified this new threat to the world's
climate. It is a cloud of smog three kilometres deep, enveloping
the whole of southern Asia - a soup of industrial pollutants,
carbon monoxide from vehicle exhausts and particles of soot from
burning forests and millions of rural cooking fires. It blocks 15%
of sunlight, which reduces crop yields. It also creates acid rain,
leads to respiratory illnesses, reduces rainfall and causes extreme
weather events. Because the cloud is capable of being dispersed
rapidly around the world, it may affect a much wider area than just
Asia. The term ""Asian Brown Cloud"" seems to have been around for a
couple of years in scientific circles, but came to prominence this
week in a report prepared by a team of international climatologists
at the UN Environment Programme in preparation for the World Summit
on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg next week. The good
news, they say, is that unlike other causes of pollution and
climate change, this one is curable if Asians can shift to more
efficient ways of burning fuels.The ""Asian Brown Cloud,"" a 2-mile-thick blanket of pollution over
South Asia, may be causing the premature deaths of half a million
people in India each year, deadly flooding in some areas and
drought in others, a new U.N.-sponsored study indicates.
                                   [""Los Angeles Times"", Aug. 2002]A UN-backed study released on Friday said the ""Asian Brown Cloud"" -
a vast haze of pollution stretching across South Asia - is damaging
agriculture, modifying rainfall patterns and endangering the

3. Weird Words: Pyknic  /'pIknIk/
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Short and fat.Nothing to do with al-fresco meals, though it is said the same way
as ""picnic"".In the early years of the twentieth century the German psychiatrist
Ernst Kretschmer examined criminals to try to tie their physical
shape and constitution to their personalities and mental illnesses.
Tall and thin ones he called ""asthenic"" (or ""leptosomic"") and
considered them to be the sort that commits fraud and petty theft.
A second set were athletic types with well-developed muscles, whom
he concluded, unsurprisingly, were more likely to be violent. The
third sort were the ""pyknic"" ones, who seemed to be a mixture of
the other two kinds so far as their criminal tendencies were
concerned. He took ""pyknic"" from Greek ""puknos"", thick or close-
packed; it appeared first in his book ""KÃ¶rperbau und Charakter""
(Physique and Character) in 1921, from where it soon moved into
English.The American psychologist William Sheldon built on and modified
Kretschmer's ideas, coming up with the three terms to describe body
types - ""endomorph"", ""mesomorph"" and ""ectomorph"" - that are now
more common. He considered Kretschmer's pyknic type to be a mixture
of the endomorph (with a soft round body tending to put on fat, the
Santa Claus type) and the mesomorph (with a compact, powerful, and
athletic body tending to the Tarzan or Mr Universe type) and came
up with the phrase ""pyknic practical joke"" to describe a person who
is muscular in early life but who later goes pear-shaped and
balloons out into obesity.
4. Q&A
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. A friend and I were reading a recent article in the ""New York
Times"" that made mention of a ""mash note"". I had never heard this
term before, but I extrapolated that it is some sort of love note.
Is there a more specific meaning than a simple love note? And can
you give some insight as to the origin of the term? [Jane
Rosenthal, California]A. You're right about the meaning of the phrase.We have to go back some way to find the origin. The first form was
the word ""mash"" by itself. This was a slang term in the US in the
1870s for an infatuation or crush (a magazine in 1877 defined it as
""a deep but fleeting affection of the heart""). A ""mash"" could also
be a dandy or the object of one's affection (of either sex) or - as
a verb - to make amorous advances to a member of the opposite sex,
to flirt or seduce. A ""masher"" was a man who thought himself
irresistible to the female sex but whose advances were often
unwelcome.The evidence collected by Professor Lighter in the ""Random House
Historical Dictionary of American Slang"" and by others suggests
that it was originally a term used in and around the theatre.
Charles Godfrey Leland (best known for his ""Hans BreitmannÂ’s
Ballads"" about a German immigrant) wrote a note above his poem,
""The Masher"", dated about 1895, confirming this:  The word to ""mash,"" in the sense of causing love or
  attracting by a glance or fascinating look, came into
  ordinary slang from the American stage. Thus an actress
  was often fined for ""mashing"" or smiling at men in the
  audience.""Mash"" and its derivatives crossed the Atlantic to Britain about
1880. ""Masher"" in particular became a term in London society,
especially among the more raffish supper-club and theatre-going
classes, for a type of fashionable male. The Oxford English
Dictionary defines it (with a distinctly maidenly air of drawing
away its collective skirts) as ""a fop of affected manners and
exaggerated style of dress who frequented music-halls and
fashionable promenades and who posed as a 'lady-killer'"", noting
that the word had been common ""in 1882 and for a few years after"".
In a letter from London in the old ""Overland Monthly and Out West
Magazine"" in 1889, a correspondent described a member of an
impoverished theatrical company: ""This dashing youth was distinctly
conscious of his fascinations for the buxom maids who sighed beside
us, and the airy and elegant nonchalance of the glances that
superbly took them in would be a lesson for champion 'mashers' of a
far higher class"".A ""mash note"" (in its first appearances, ""mash letter"") was an
obvious enough extension: a love letter. It is recorded first in
1880 and - as you have discovered - is still doing well.Where ""mash"" and its relatives come from has been a subject of
debate. It is sometimes said that it is from the standard English
word meaning to make soft by one of various means, with its obvious
reference to rendering the object of one's attentions pliable and
yielding. Max Beerbohm, writing in London in 1894 (mashers were
still around then, despite the OED's comment) remarked that some
people derived it from ""Ma ChÃ¨re"", ""the mode of address used by the
gilded youth to the barmaids of the period"". But he thought it
really came from ""the chorus of a song, which, at that time, had a
great vogue in the music-halls: 'I'm the slashing, dashing, mashing
Montmorency of the day.'"" We're pretty sure now that he was wrong,
but he could hardly know that.Back to Charles Leland again. Apart from his humorous writings, he
also researched and wrote a great deal about the Romany language as
well as Gypsy songs and customs. The following note from the
introduction to the poem gives an origin that is now widely
accepted:  It was introduced by the well-known gypsy family of actors,
  C., among whom Romany was habitually spoken. The word
  ""masher"" or ""mash"" means in that tongue to allure, delude,
  or entice. It was doubtless much aided in its popularity by
  its quasi-identity with the English word. But there can be
  no doubt as to the gypsy origin of ""mash"" as used on the
  stage. I am indebted for this information to the late well-
  known impresario Palmer of New York, and I made a note of
  it years before the term had become at all popular.Though defunct in British English, ""mash"" and ""masher"" have never
quite gone away in America. ""Mash"" had a resurgence of popularity
as student slang in the 1980s in the sense of necking or petting,
though that may be a back-formation from ""mash note"".
5. Endnote

""A Spanish lady asked an acquaintance during a visit to Ireland
whether there was a word in his language similar to 'manaÃ±a'. The
Irishman thought for a moment, then said: 'Sure there is, but it
doesn't have the same sense of urgency.'"" [Traditional Irish joke.]

"With v2.14 of razor client and using Solaris 9 with sendmail 8.12.5 I have

something like this:Received2: Date: [date];
	Local: sub.dom2.tld (IP#2);
	Remote: sub.dom3.tld (IP#3);
	Env-id: 
	Code: [cache#, salted hashvalue, rsa or other signature] And then you have the two optional From and To, only added by the sending
server that's identified the local sender or the server accepting mail for a
certain user (to verify that it did really come via that server, in case you
forward it using procmail or something like it).
 You of course would need some standard for how to check these headers. Not perfect, but better than what we have today.

list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to

MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :

""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand

"re : 6 . 797 , comparative method : n - ary comparison gotcha ! there are two separate fallacies in the argument against n-ary comparison which i discussed recently and which powers , delancey , and guy are now apparently seeking to defend . ( 1 ) janhunen says that the probability of a match occurring purely by chance when you compare japanese with four languages is four times what it is when you compare it with one language . this simply cannot be true because probabilities are values between 0 and 1 . if the probablity in the case of a binary comparison was say . 5 , then he would be predicting that it would be 2 in the case of n-ary comparison , which is impossible , because 2 is not between 0 and 1 . ( 2 ) the other fallacy is not purely mathematical , although i suspect that it involves elements of confusio . in any case , no one who argues for n-ary comparison ever talks about getting a match in 2 out of n languages . now , if we look at guy 's numbers , in his scenario of a 100 - word list with no shifted meanings , he came up with 14 . 5 probable spurious mathces in a binary comparison but only 5 . 8 when you are looking for a match between 3 out of 5 languages , 0 . 13 when you look for one between 4 out of 5 , and he does not give the much smaller number yet in the case of 5 out of 5 . i am not sure how jacques defines spurious and so i have not verified the numbers , but they are certainly on the right orders of magnitude . as you consider more and more languages ( also as the initial probability of a match declines , which usually happens as you go from toy models to real data ) , what happens is that you need fewer and fewer out of the n languages being compared to agree . thus , in guy 's example a match between n - 2 languages out of 5 was less likely to occur by chance than one between 2 out of 2 . but if n were 100 , i . e . , you were comparing 100 languages , then you would not need n - 2 ( i . e . , 98 ) languages to agree to be able to do better than with a binary comparison . it would be many many fewer ( although i do n't know how many since i do not know what formula jacques is using and what he is assuming about the initial probability of a match ) . maybe , he could kindly supply the numbers . and in light of all this , let us add another argument for rejecting indo - european : bopp never offered a mathematical demonstration that the relationships he proposed were unlikely to be due to chance , much less by doing a binary comparison of every pair of indo - european languages . which i think just goes to show how unrealistic the whole idea of doing such comparisons is . but if you do want to do them , then at least let us be clear about how to do them so as to minimize false positives ( i . e . matches due to chance and not really reflective of common origin ) as well as false negatives ( i . e . , failures to find genuine historical connections ) . on the second point , there are arguments that n-ary is better . alexis mr",Safe Email

was beautiful. Odd colors and light. Obviously we wondered what it was. Today 
Jim explains it. (It was a rocket test from the Vandenburg air force base). 
Very neat. It was a bit too blurred out when I saw it, and there was too much 
street light to make a good photo, so I am happy to have found the photo from

Well Beberg, unless you're really into Anime and actually hold true
