"how 's it going ? hello friend , my name is carl simmons . in october 1988 , i received this bulletin in the mail . naturally i was skeptical , but i decided to try it because i was heavily in debt at the time . i had everything to gain and nothing to lose . even if this program worked only a fraction of what the example showed , i would be a success ! well , i m adding this note here to tell you it does work ! i will never forget how it happened . i followed the instructions exactly . the total cost was about $ 46 . 00 including postage . i dropped the envelopes off a the post office on my way to work one day in late october hoping to earn a few dollars to buy christmas presents . the recipe i ordered from the person in the # 1 position came in about a week . i did not think much about it after that until a few weeks later when my boss told me my wife had called and i was needed at home immediately due to some emergency . i raced home in a panic , threw the apartment door open , and what a sight i saw ! my wife was standing over a pile of envelopes that the mailman had dumped on the living room floor from two big canvas bags . we spend the rest of the day and most of the night opening and counting 3 , 245 envelopes , each containing $ 2 . 00 and a self-addressed stamped envelope . the next day we received 4 , 274 more . by the time the orders stopped coming in , about two weeks later , i had received $ 92 , 428 . 00 in cash ! ( i wonder what the printer though when i had him print 46 , 000 copies of the recipes in one week ! ) needless to say , i immediately quit my job , paid off al my debts in full and started another mailing . to date my revenues are approaching $ 1 , 000 , 000 . 00 in cold hard cash . believe me , you can do the same thing . this is you lucky break that you have been hoping for all your life . you can make your dreams come true . . . do not pass it up ! the most difficult part was finding a good company to provide responsive names . after trying many name sources , i ran across two companies that provided the best names for this program . their addresses and prices are below : mjg advertising 200 names $ 24 . 00 p . o . box 3009 500 names $ 35 . 00 maple glen , pa 19002 1000 names $ 50 . 00 ( 215 ) 643-1328 2000 names $ 75 . 00 ( 800 ) 880-8143 marnico lists 200 names $ 20 . 00 p . o . box 2046 500 names $ 35 . 00 abington , ma 02351 1000 names $ 60 . 00 request # 3001 2000 names $ 95 . 00 making your fortune is as easy as following these six steps : 1 . send a self addressed stamped envelope and $ 2 . 00 cash wrapped in a sheet of paper specifying which recipe you are ordering by number , to addresses # 1 through # 5 at the end of this bulletin . 2 . order at least 200 names and addresses on labels from the companies mentioned earlier . 3 . while waiting for your labels to arrive , remove the name at the # 1 spot and move each of the names up one position . place your name and address in spot # 5 . move only the names and addresses - not the recipes . this can best be done by retyping the set and pasting the new over the original . 4 . have a local printshop print at least 200 copies of this bulletin . 5 . fold the printed bulletins and place in envelopes , seal and stamp them . 6 . when the labels arrive , place one on each envelope and mail them . now here s the best part - the money you can make ! here is what happens when only 10 % of the people respond to your mailing . you send out at least 200 with your name in position # 5 . 20 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 4 . 400 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 3 . 8000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 2 . 160000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 1 . 168420 x $ 2 . 00 each = $ 336840 in about 60 to 90 days ! ! ! of course you are not limited to mailing only 200 bulletins , or to just one mailing . send out more than 250 or do repeat mailings and you will drastically increase your earnings . when you receive 1 , 000 requests for recipe # 3 , sit back and relax knowing that you re soon going to be a very rich person . yes , this is a perfectly legal mail order marketing plan . if you are in doubt , then refer to title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 of the u . s . postal and lottery laws . a product or service must be exchanged for the money received ; in this case , the product is the recipes . this plan also takes honest work , but the rewards are tremendous . keep a careful account of all money you received and money you spend for income tax purposes . there you have it ! the secret to making thousands for yourself . read this bulletin carefully and then reread it again . think about it , do the math and consider the wealth potential this holds for you . then send $ 2 . 00 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope today to the addresses in positions # 1 below . go for it , order those recipes today . 1 . chocolate cream pie 2 . pineapple bavarian pudding henry w . frye , sr . harold lookwood 24684 atwood ave . 123 skokorat st . moreno valley , ca 92553 seymour , ct . 06483 3 . chocolate walnut cookies 4 . cheese garlic biscuits vincent myers , jr . dlh enterprises inc . 848 n . rainbow , # 351 p . o . box 5854 las vegas , nv 89107 san jose , ca 95150 5 . magic cookies bar acw enterprises p . o . box 3004-332 corvallis , or 97333 i tried a similar program in which the cost was $ 5 . 00 . in that one , the response was only about 3 % . the first time i sent out this recipe program a got my first responses in just one week . i sent out 250 letters instead of just 100 so my percentage of gains was higher . i am trying again with 500 letters to see if i can surpass the $ 141 , 236 . 00 of the last time . good luck to all of you . it really works ! ! ! sally freisch , st louis , il",Phishing Email

"california power 1 / 19 / 00 executive summary : sb - 7 x gives dept . of water and resources given legislative authority to undertake short - term power purchases with no price cap through feb . 2 nd new legislation ( ab - 1 x and sb - 6 x ) would seek ( 1 ) long - term contracts with 5 . 5 cent cap and ( 2 ) creation of california power and conservation financing authority the long - term contracts proposed in ab - 1 x are likely to be subject to significant amendment and renegotiation prior to the feb . 2 nd expiration of sb - 7 x . the authority proposed in sb - 6 x would have bond issuance powers to finance new generation capacity and conservation measures negotiations under way on using bond authority for a utility bailout - - utilities and state government split over debt obligations of utility parents state borrowing plans and power purchases create credit risks for state treasury ; socal edison misses more payments bush administration opposes price caps , but is supporting state efforts to split pg we believe he then could be willing to guarantee or issue bonds to deal with the rest . as one very senior california political leader explained , getting the utility holding companies to eat a substantial part of the debt they owe themselves is the key to solving the back debt problem without provoking widespread public outrage about a "" bailout "" of private price - gouging companies with taxpayer money . since 75 % of californians currently blame the utilities and the puc for this crisis ( and only 10 % blame davis ) , this is a crucial political stance for the governor . but , of course , absorbing anything like $ 6 billion in debt would be quite a shock to the seemingly healthy holding company and power - generating branches of the two utilities , and they began spreading the word that they were quite willing to accept bankruptcy . thus by mid - week , both sides had pushed themselves toward a resolution in federal bankruptcy court that would be a worst case solution for all sides : the country ' s economy would suffer from the resulting credit shock , the governor ' s political future would suffer from the electricity rate increases almost certain to be mandated by a bankruptcy judge , while most private sector legal authorities believe the utilities corporate holding structure would ultimately be breached during bankruptcy procedures and they would end up having to absorb some significant amount of the debt in the end . in addition , they would most likely face a state government determined to use state powers of condemnation to enter the power business in a major way . senator burton ' s sb 6 x legislation will strengthen those powers dramatically to make this point quite explicit . it would set up a "" california power and conservation financing authority , "" with the power to issue bonds and invoke eminent domain . it would finance new power plants , and "" consider the feasibility and public interest of the state acquiring , operating , and maintaining transmission facilities currently owned by investor - owned and municipal utilities . "" as we write this , all sides are trying to construct a path back down from the bankruptcy ledge to safe ground , and there is no question the tone has shifted in the last 24 hours from macho confrontation to "" maybe we ' ve run this thing out as far as we can . "" but as we have noted , the chance for miscalculation is still quite high . there is no solution agreed to at this time , the stand - off over how much debt the state government will absorb versus the utilities ' holding company is continuing , and the technical fact of default still makes it possible for some bank to trigger bankruptcy by demanding immediate accelerated payment . 5 . default update - thursday socal edison - $ 215 million default to california power exchange . after edison failed to make a $ 215 m electricity payment yesterday , the california power authority began seizing long - term contacts and reselling them to recoup some of the money owed to generators . pg & e said it expects its trading privileges at the cal . power authority to be suspended today , leaving them with only its generation from nuclear and hydroelectric sources . while the ongoing wave of defaults has severely restricted pg & e ' s and socal ' s ability to buy power , the department of water and resources will be able to pick up some of the slack , at least in the very short - term . the state itself may be getting into risky credit territory . the proposed california public power authority would borrow in the neighborhood of $ 1 . 3 billion from the state general fund in advance of this year ' s expected fiscal surplus , with the loan to be repaid by the authority from expected future revenues . with near - bankrupt utilities and a freeze on rate hikes , it is unclear where the revenues would come from . the amount borrowed and terms of repayment will be no doubt examined very carefully by the bond rating agencies . 5 . bush policies as we reported on wednesday , the bush administration continues to demonstrate little interest in getting involved in the california crisis . president - elect bush surprised state leaders yesterday with his comments , which essentially said that excessive environmental regulation was the root of the current supply shortage . bush and his top officials appear to be unanimously opposed to long - term price caps . however , there is one issue of considerable importance to the administration , according to a source close to a top bush economic advisor . there is significant concern that pg & e ' s credit problems could cause gas suppliers to stop shipments of gas through pg & e ' s pipeline . the risk would be that the pipeline could "" go dry "" , causing significant and possibly dangerous disruptions in california residences and businesses . to prevent this problem , bush is working with davis on a proposal to split pg & e into separate gas and electric companies . the gas company would be solvent , but the electric company would go immediately into ch . 11 following significant defaults .",Safe Email

"icla call for papers 4th international cognitive linguistics conference july 17 - july 21 , 1995 , albuquerque , new mexico * aims and scope the international cognitive linguistics conference offers a forum for research within the perspective of cognitive linguistics . this perspective subsumes a number of concerns and broadly compatible theoretical approaches that share a common basis : the idea that language is an integral part of cognition which reflects the interaction of cultural , psychological , communicative , and functional considerations , and which can only be understood in the context of a realistic view of conceptualization and mental processing . topics of interest for cognitive linguistics include the structural characteristics of natural language categorization ( such as prototypicality , metaphor , mental imagery , and cognitive models ) , the functional principles of linguistic organization ( such as iconicity and naturalness ) , the conceptual interface between syntax and semantics , the experiential and pragmatic background of language-in - use , and the relationship between language and thought . in addition , topics of special interest for the 1995 conference include cross-linguistic studies and cognitive linguistic approaches to signed language research . * conference site the 1995 conference will take place on the campus of the university of new mexico ( unm ) in albuquerque . albuquerque lies between the foothills of the sandia mountains ( with peaks of more than 10 , 000 feet ) and the west mesa ( which is dotted with the cinder cones of long-extinct volcanoes ) ; dividing the city is the winding rio grande valley , famous for its bosque nature preserve . at an altitude of roughly 5000 feet , the university campus enjoys warm summer days and cool nights . excursions to nearby pueblos , santa fe , and the sandia mountains are being planned . also taking place at unm during the summer of 1995 is the linguistic society of america 's biennial linguistic institute . under the direction of joan bybee , li-95 will run for six weeks from late june to early august and will include over 50 courses taught by visiting faculty as well as special lectures . the conceptual structure for li-95 applies cross-linguistic comparison and a functional orientation to the major areas of linguistics and the language emphases of the university of new mexico program : signed languages , spanish , and native american languages . several other conferences are planned to precede and follow the 1995 icla conference . * submission of abstracts authors are requested to submit four copies of a one-page abstract in hardcopy format to the address below . abstracts must be received before november 30 , 1994 . authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by february 1 , 1995 . sherman wilcox / icla95 department of linguistics university of new mexico albuquerque , nm 87131",Safe Email

> Most of them seem to have Ivy League educations, or are Ivy League
> dropouts suggesting to me that they weren't exactly poor to start
> with.Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's
composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to
get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say
""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,
like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught
you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of
*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get
around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing
transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's
government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of
innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this
summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out
there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]
The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a
""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the
best school possible.Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,
for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,
ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the
years for proof.Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after
World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,
Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who
goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually
afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who
couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the
last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,
and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.
The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""
degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or
learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss
basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after
death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people
who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*
smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this
rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to
beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You
were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to
Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,
much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on
this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with
educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The
facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.
There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and
economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including
ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,
intelligence and effort.[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of
competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,
apparently.]BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,
*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,
all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and
there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,
most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have
*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically
all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and
not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The
People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better
stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept
apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd
know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase
in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about
extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who
doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some
politician as Santa Claus come election time...
In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not
theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and
redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just
that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx
wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.Cheers,

against something that wasn't installed through rpm :-/What I'd recommend in your case : You should keep at least one original Red
Hat Linux kernel (you do just in case, right? ;-)) and install the matching
alsa-kernel package as you'll need at least one because of the
dependencies. Then for your custom built kernel, simply ""./configure
--with-cards=all && make && make install DESTDIR=/tmp/alsa-driver"" from the
alsa-driver sources then as root copy all the modules under
/tmp/alsa-driver/lib/modules/ to your modules dir and run ""depmod -a"".Of course you can even make it much faster by not compiling all un-needed
drivers, as I guess that's one of the reasons one would rebuild his own
kernel.I find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem. It's
what I've done and what I'll keep doing on my laptop where I'm running a
kernel recompiled with ACPI.Matthias--

"Short version:
T-Mobile Broadband is in the process of wiring every starbucks in the area
(T1 backhauled to some ~local POP + 802.11) as part of what I'm told is a
national rollout. The Diesel is close enough to the Elm St starbucks for me
to get reasonable net throughout most of the cafe. The rumor is that they'll be announcing that they've got boston covered on
the 21st.  I've heard from at least one source that they're actually going
to announce a much wider national rollout at that time.  It's not cheap [1], but

[I'm sure somebody will tell me about the original source; it's in a
number of places on the web. -gkm]Forwarded-by: Colin Burgess The Beer Scooter How many times have you woken up in the morning after a hard night
drinking and thought 'How on earth did I get home? As hard as you
try, you cannot piece together your return journey from the pub to
your house. The answer to this puzzle is that you used a Beer
Scooter.The Beer Scooter is a mythical form of transport, owned and leased
to the drunk by Bacchus the Roman god of wine. Bacchus has branched
out since the decrease in the worship of the Roman Pantheon and
has bought a large batch of these magical devices. The Beer Scooter
works in the following fashion:-The passenger reaches a certain level of drunkenness and the
""slurring gland"" begins to give off a pheromone. Bacchus or one of
his many sub-contractors detects this pheromone and sends down a
winged Beer Scooter. The scooter scoops up the passenger and deposits
them in their bedroom via the Trans-Dimensional Portal. This is
not cheap to run, so a large portion of the passenger's in-pocket
cash is taken as payment.This answers the second question after a night out 'How did I spend
so much money?'Unfortunately, Beer Scooters have a poor safety record and are
thought to be responsible for over 90% of all UDI (Unidentified
Drinking Injuries).  An undocumented feature of the beer scooter
is the destruction of time segments during the trip. The nature of
Trans-Dimensional Portals dictates that time will be lost, seemingly
unaccounted for.This answers a third question after a night out 'What the hell
happened?'With good intentions, Bacchus opted for the REMIT (Removal of
Embarrassing Moments In Time) add on, that automatically removes,
in descending order, those parts in time regretted most. Unfortunately
one person's REMIT is not necessarily the REMIT of another and
quite often lost time is regained in discussions over a period of
time. Independent studies have also shown that Beer Goggles often
cause the scooter's navigation system to malfunction thus sending
the passenger to the wrong bedroom, often with horrific consequences.
With recent models including a GPS, Bacchus made an investment in
a scooter drive-thru chain specialising in half eaten kebabs and
pizza crusts.Another question answered!! For the family man, Beer Scooters come
equipped with flowers picked from other people's garden and
Thump-A-Lot boots (Patent Pending). These boots are designed in
such a way that no matter how quietly you tip-toe up the stairs,
you are sure to wake up your other half. Special anti-gravity
springs ensure that you bump into every wall in the house and the
CTSGS (Coffee Table Seeking Guidance System) explains the bruised
shins. The final add-on Bacchus saw fit to invest in for some
scooters is the TAS (Tobacco Absorption System). This explains how
one person can apparently get through 260 Marlboro Lights in a
single night.PS: Don't forget the on-board heater, which allows you to comfortably
get home from the pub in sub-zero temperatures, wearing just a
T-shirt.

"linux - - hit or miss ? network world fusion focus : phil hochmuth on linux today ' s focus : will linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop ? 03 / 15 / 00 dear wincenty kaminski , today ' s focus : will linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop ? by phil hochmuth so far this year , the buzz about linux in enterprise networks has focused on servers and embedded systems , with the growth of linux severs being most heralded . according to idc , a research firm based in framingham , mass . , linux was the fastest - growing server operating system last year , with a 93 % growth rate over the year before . linux was the second most - shipped operating system in 1999 after windows nt , capturing 24 % of new licenses shipped . as for the embedded market , linux has emerged as an ideal platform for network appliances , because the system can be modified to handle specialized , dedicated tasks very well . companies such as cobalt networks , picazo and progressive systems have announced linux - based appliances , ranging from web servers to pbxs to firewalls . but what of the open source hacker  , s dream of  & linux on every desktop ?  8 sure , linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever , with colorful , shrink - wrapped boxes of caldera , red hat and corel linux now available at places like compusa . however , analysts have said that linux  , s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro areas of network servers and embedded operating systems . according to idc , linux currently runs on only 4 % of u . s . desktops . the hold microsoft windows has on the desktop market will remain strong , analysts say , despite such factors as microsoft  , s antitrust problems and the surging popularity of linux . even some linux executives are skeptical of their product  , s desktop future . recently , suse ceo roland dyroff downplayed linux  , s future on desktops . dyroff said ,  & given the lack of applications available , we really can ' t claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet .  8 a recent survey by survey . com gives more hope for linux desktops . according to the survey of 1 , 640 enterprise network managers , open source operating systems are used on 10 % of desktops , with the number jumping to a surprising 23 % of enterprise desktops by 2002 . despite the mix of numbers being thrown around , two important factors that will determine the success of linux as an enterprise client desktop are : a standardized , easy - to - use graphical user interface ( gui ) and available applications . one company that is working to make linux more user friendly is palo alto - based eazel , which is designing a next - generation file management system and user interface to run on top of the linux kernel . according to eazel  , s web site , the company  , s goal is to bring linux to the masses and  & do it in a way that appeals to today ' s linux users and to mere mortals .  8 the company was founded by a group of former apple executives , and is allied with the gnome project , which has been doing extensive linux desktop environment development for several years . eazel is due to have a product out by the middle of this year . with an intuitive , icon - based file management environment , eazel is hoping its user interface will be an improvement over the two current linux guis , gnome and kde , and will help standardized the look and feel of linux for  & regular  8 users . for enterprise mangers who have already embraced linux on the server side , this development will be worth keeping an eye on . on the applications side , several office productivity suites have been available for some time , such as sun  , s staroffice suite and koffice for the kde desktop . corel has also ported its office products , such as wordperfect , over to linux to complement its own distribution of the operating system . while there have been recent rumors ( started by linux care vice president arthur tyde ) that microsoft is working on a port of ms office to linux , microsoft officials deny this . while linux may never supplant windows as the industry - standard desktop , there should be plenty of opportunity for linux pcs in enterprise nets in the future . to contact phil hochmuth : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - phil hochmuth is a writer and researcher for network world , and a former systems integrator . you can reach him at mailto : phochmut @ nww . com . for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page : http : / / www . nwfusion . com staroffice software from sun http : / / www . sun . com / staroffice corel linux os http : / / www . corel . com / freedom / freedom . htm eazel http : / / www . eazel . com gnome - - the gnu network object model environment http : / / www . gnome . org koffice - - the integrated office suite for kde , the k desktop environment http : / / koffice . kde . org / cobalt networks , inc . http : / / www . cobaltnetworks . com progressive systems http : / / www . progressive - systems . com picazo http : / / www . picazo . com other linux - related articles from network world : active directory upgrade requires strong game plan , network world , 03 / 13 / 00 subscription services to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters , go to : to change your email address , go to : subscription questions ?

BerkeleyDB.  It's true that we have fewer database experts and expend
fewer resources working on database reliability.  On the other hand,
Barry is nearly finished with a BerkeleyDB-based storage for ZODB.ZODB is an object persistence tool that uses a database behind it.
You can use our FileStorage or you can use someone else's database,
although BerkeleyDB is the best we can offer at the moment.  (It would

This sounds like a Zope complaint that doesn't have anything to do
with ZODB, but maybe I misunderstand you.  You don't have to store
your code in the database, although that will be mostly possible in
ZODB4.Seriously, ZODB stores object pickles in a database.  The storage
layer is free to manage those pickles however it likes.  FileStorage
uses a single file.  Toby Dickenson's DirectoryStorage represents each
pickle as a separate file.  SM> * It seems to grow without bound, else why do I need to pack my
  SM>       Data.fs file every now and then?It grows without bound unless you pack it.  Why is that a problem? 
BerkeleyDB log files grow without bound, too.  Databases require some
tending.  One possibility with FileStorage is to add an explicit
pack() call to update training operation.  We'd need to think
carefully about the performance impact.  SM> Also, there is the issue of availability.  While it's just an

Click here to download now!   As if there weren't enough hypocrisy and misinformation 
being spewed by marketing and sales departments. This time, 
a startling revelation that Microsoft refuses 
to use their own ISA Server to protect themselves from the 
very things the product is meant to stop - worms and 
intrusion. Nimda was turned loose within Microsoft and 
they've chosen NetScreen's 500 series security appliance to 
cure what ills them. I find this staggeringly hilarious, to 
say the least. The move is tantamount to Intel deploying 
desktops based on AMD processors!Ok, so a hardware solution might be better than a 
software defense in many cases. I suppose we can't entirely 
blame Microsoft for opting to go that route. Probably a wise 
decision, in fact - admit defeat and move on. However, why 
is Nimda spreading within the corporate walls to the point 
that they felt the needed to make such a leap in the first 
place? After all, patches were released months ago, so IIS 
is impervious to attack now. Still considering the 
deployment of IIS as your web server platform of choice?

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-035.asp
During the installation of SQL Server 7.0 or 2000, 
various bits of configuration information are stored in a 
setup.iss file, including account passwords that have been 
captured in order to configure the services. Prior to 
certain service packs, these passwords are stored as clear 
text, which is problematic because the file is left on the 
hard drive after the installation process is completed. 
Peruse the details of the bulletin to be sure you've cleaned 
up any relevant bits and pieces applicable to your 
environment.
SQL Server Cumulative Patch
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-034.asp
A new roll-up patch is available for SQL Server that takes 
care of all previous security issues, plus a trio of new 
items. Two buffer overrun vulnerabilities exist that could 
allow an attacker to gain control over the server, and a 
different privilege elevation flaw can be exploited due to 
improper permissions within the registry. All three are 
spackled over by the latest cumulative patch described 
further in this bulletin.

Win2K Memory Allocation Adjustments
Unearthed by Wayne Clarkhttp://searchwin2000.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid1_gci835208,00.html
Most Windows 2000 servers tune themselves fairly well and 
do not need further tweaking. In those cases, it's best to 
just leave things alone unless you specifically identify a 
problem somewhere. Serdar Yegulalp has an excellent 
explanation of one particular situation where memory pools 
can be exhausted and crash the server. Before you go diving 
into the registry to play with the knobs and buttons, be 
certain you know what you're messing with or you could just 
make things worse. Backups, backups, backups.

Sorting IP Addresses Via Script
http://www.i386.com/Default.asp?page=docs/scripting-ip2long.htm&category=admin&id=1046
Documentation is everything. If you have a handle on your 
network configuration, it's much easier to manage. IP 
addresses are one bit of information that must be properly 
tracked, but often it's a manual effort to enter and sort 
data. Using the script techniques provided in this brief 
article, you can convert an address to a 32-bit number, 
perform the sort, then convert back to the standard dotted 
decimal format. An Excel sample spreadsheet is also provided 
to get you started.

Broadband Sharing Crackdown
http://news.com.com/2100-1033-942323.html
Those of us with wireless networking equipment might be 
tempted to allow the neighbors to share the wealth, but be 
careful. Broadband companies are catching on and putting a 
stop to the practice. What's concerning to me is that I 
don't share my wireless network, but I do use quite a few 
different machines at any given time. If someone is snooping 
around and seeing a lot of different sessions and gets 
curious, might I be subject to a teeth-kicking?Virtual Sketching

I believe I still have an old Etch-A-Sketch in a box 
somewhere. Maybe I should dig it back out and webify the 
thing just for grins. Check out this example of novelty web 
programming, assuming y'all don't kill the site. If it's 
down, check back later. Using a web form, you can enter the

"Have a BLAST in bed
Have a BLAST in bed,
GUARANTEED!
Finally, a safe and natural penile enlargement
supplement!
 Naturally boost your sex drive and rejuvenate sexual
function.
Good news, men! Recent
discoveries in herbal medicine have made it possible for men to
safely and effectively boost their sexual vitality while increasing
their penis size by 25% or more!
Certified Natural Laboratories is pleased to introduce the
latest addition to their widely acclaimed line of herbal
supplements: Maxamanâ„¢.
Specially formulated with herbs and extracts from around
the globe, Maxamanâ„¢ can help to enhance sexual sensitivity,
increase sexual stamina, and actually increase the size of your
penis by up to 25%. The special blend of herbs in Maxamanâ„¢
have been shown to boost blood flow to the penis, thus expanding
the sponge-like erectile tissue in the penis, leading to size gains
in both length and thickness.
A
recent survey showed that 68% of women are unsatisfied with the
size of their partners. Of course most of these women would never
tell their partner that they are unhappy with their penis size.
Having a small or average-sized penis can result in depression and
feelings of inadequacy. Thankfully, men of all ages can now safely
and naturally increase the size of their penis and renew sexual
vitality without resorting to dangerous surgery.
What To
Expect:
1-2 weeks
 Most men notice more powerful and longer lasting erections almost
immediately. A noticeable increase in thickness is also
common.3-8 weeks
 By this point you should be able to notice an increase in
thickness in both erect and flaccid states, as well as an overall
increase in length.9 weeks +
 After nine weeks, your penis should be noticeably larger in both
length and girth.
Â 
Below is a comparison chart compiled from the most recent
data on penis size. See how you measure up...
How to measure your penis size
correctly: To determine length, measure the erect penis
from the base of the penis where the top of the shaft meets the
pubic area (the peno-pubic junction) to the tip of the head. For
uncircumcised men the foreskin should be retracted. To determine
width, measure at mid-shaft around the circumference while the
penis is erect.Whether you have a small, average or large penis, it is now
possible for you to increase the size of your penis by up to 25%
without resorting to dangerous surgery or cumbersome
weights.

I've just changed my sendmail installation and am looking for the 'proper' way to pass it through there, systemwide, before accepting it and sending it to the users.  It's kinda problematic to set up procmail scripts for every user, when the user's home directories are NFS mounted....and the source is on my own machine, on which I try new things. (And it's the only machine with the drivespace...)

"From: Donald Eastlake 3rd 
July 16, 2002
By Yonder Blessed Moon, Sleuths Decode Life and Art
By LEON JAROFFOn its way back from the Pacific island of Tinian, where it had
delivered the uranium core for the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima,
the heavy cruiser Indianapolis was torpedoed by the Japanese submarine
I-58 and sent to the bottom of the Philippine Sea. It was one of the
worst disasters in American naval history; only 317 of its nearly 1,200
crew members survived.Now experts at Southwest Texas State University have given that tragic
story a startling new twist.It was the moon, they say, that sank the Indianapolis. Or anyway, they
write in the July issue of Sky & Telescope, it was the moon that made
the sinking possible.Using astronomical computer programs, records and weather reports, as
well as the known coordinates and running speeds of the ship and the
submarine that sank it, the authors determined that when the I-58
surfaced, it was perfectly aligned, west to east, with the cruiser. And,
they said, a three-quarter moon had just emerged from behind the clouds.Looking across the moonlit water, an I-58 crewman spotted the ship
silhouetted against the sky, 10.3 miles away. Half an hour later, six
torpedoes sent it to the bottom.""It was sheer chance,"" said Dr. Donald Olson, an astronomer. ""Without
that alignment with the moon, the lookouts would not have spotted the
cruiser, especially at that distance.""With Russell Doescher, a physics lecturer, Dr. Olson conducts a
university honors course called ""Astronomy in Art, History and
Literature."" In the last 15 years, he has pinpointed the time and place
of the rendering of art masterpieces, given new interpretations of
astronomical references in Chaucer and revealed the decisive role of the
moon in military and other encounters.Two years ago, for example, Dr. Olson turned his attention to the bright
star in van Gogh's ""White House at Night."" He and some students went to
Auvers, France, where van Gogh created his final works, and searched
until they found the house, largely unchanged. Sifting through letters
from van Gogh to his brother, Dr. Olson found that the painting was
completed in June 1890.Noting the orientation of the house in the painting, he determined where
van Gogh had set his easel and what section of the sky he had portrayed,
and from the lighting and shadows, he established that the house had
been illuminated by the setting sun. His computer analysis then
identified the ""star."" It was Venus, which in early evening in mid-June
had occupied that part of the sky.A final check of local weather records pinpointed the actual date van
Gogh had composed the painting, June 16, the only clear day in the
middle of the month that year.Dr. Olson has also turned his attention to Shakespeare, intrigued by the
opening of ""Hamlet,"" when guards on the ramparts of Elsinor refer to the
""star that's westward from the pole had made his course to illume that
part of heaven where now it burns."" From the guards' description, the
season and the time, other astronomers had suggested several bright
stars as possibilities, but Dr. Olson's calculations placed it in the
constellation Cassiopeia, which lacks any notably luminous stars.Pondering this problem on a trip with his wife, Dr. Olson was suddenly
inspired. He was aware that in 1572, a supernova, called Tycho's star,
for the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, suddenly flamed in Cassiopeia,
creating a worldwide sensation. Shakespeare, 8 at the time, would
certainly have recalled the event, and his memory was probably refreshed
by the description of the supernova in a history book that was the
source of some of his best-known plays.Dr. Olson has no doubt that the star that glared above Elsinor that
night was Tycho's, and he has an impressive record of other
astronomy-based sleuthing.Aware that the photographer Ansel Adams often neglected to date his
negatives, Dr. Olson set out to find when Adams had shot his classic
""Moon and Half Dome."" At Yosemite, Dr. Olson and his students found
Adams's vantage point, studied the location, phase and features of the
moon in the photograph, plus the shadows on the Dome, snow on the peak
and other clues, and then announced that the picture had been taken at
4:14 p.m., Dec. 28, 1960.Then, Dr. Olson calculated that the setting would be virtually identical
at 4:05 p.m. on Dec. 13, 1994. On that day Adams's daughter-in-law
visited Yosemite and was photographed holding a print of ""Moon and the
Half Dome"" in the foreground of an eerily similar view of the actual
moon and the Half Dome.Analyzing Chaucer's works, Dr. Olson has confirmed that a particularly
rapid movement of the moon described in ""The Merchant's Tale"" occurred
in April 1389. And in ""The Franklin's Tale,"" Chaucer's description of
the heavenly alignment that caused an exceptionally high tide on the
Brittany coast, convinced Dr. Olson that Chaucer was an advanced amateur
astronomer.Then there was Paul Revere. On his way to saddle up for his famous ride,
how did he manage to row undetected past a British warship on a moonlit
night in Boston Harbor? Dr. Olson's computer program revealed that,
while the moon was nearly full that night, it was unusually close to the
southern horizon and did not illuminate Revere's boat.Dr. Olson's proudest achievement was explaining ""the tide that failed""
in the bloody Marine Corps landing at Tarawa atoll on Nov. 20, 1943.
Planners had expected a tide to provide a water depth of five feet over
a reef some 600 yards from shore, allowing larger landing craft, with
drafts of at least four feet, to pass.But that day and the next, in the words of some observers, ""the ocean
just sat there,"" providing neither low tide nor high tide and leaving a
mean depth of three feet over the reef. The craft grounded on the edge
of the reef, and many marines were killed or injured as they waded 600
yards to the shore, rifles over their heads, in the face of machine-gun
fire from the Japanese.Asked by a former marine about the tidal phenomenon, Dr. Olson spent six
months researching and mastering tidal theory and discovered that the
military planners were aware that they had to contend with a ""neap""
tide. This phenomenon occurs twice a month when the moon is near its
first or last quarter, because the countering tug of the sun causes
water levels to deviate less.But that day, the moon was also almost at its farthest point from earth
and exerted even less pull, leaving the waters relatively undisturbed
and the marines in trouble.""I'm not in the least blaming the planners,"" Dr. Olson said, explaining
that the techniques used in accurately determining tides hadn't been
applied to the waters at Tarawa.Indeed, he modestly claims, by using his computer program, ""We can
calculate the tides in any port in the world on any day in history.""Yet Dr. Olson's greatest satisfaction seems to stem from his
interdisciplinary approach to astronomical sleuthing. ""I have thought
about van Gogh, about Shakespeare and Chaucer,"" he says, ""and that has
made my life as a scientist much richer.""

"proposal for a morphological database of classical greek i am writing to seek input on a proposal that we tentatively plan to submit to the neh at the end of the summer . the idea is fairly simple : we want to use the morphological parser that we have been developing for the past eight years or so to generate morphological analyses of every unique string in the thesaurus linguae graecae ( tlg ) , the database of greek texts available on cd rom from uc irvine . the tlg is large - - 42 million words at present and a new version is due out later this year with 57 million words . greek is a highly inflected language - - not as bad as georgian and some others , but a verb can , with prefixes , have millions of different forms . the tlg corpus extends over a thousand years and includes virtually all literary greek , and thus would support diachronic as well as synchronic linguistic analysis . i would like to know if there is anything we could do that would make this work on greek useful for the linguistics community in general ? classicists need this database , but it would be very exciting if it could stimulate additional work . the working summary of the project follows . the proposal outline is fairly succinct ( c . 7 pages ) but it is full of greek and does not lend itself readily to transliteration . if you would like to see a copy , please send me your us mail address and we will send one to you . casual reactions to just this summary are , however , more than welcome . note : reactions need not be positive . if this does not seem a worthwhile thing to pursue , i would love to know why . thanks ! gregory crane department of classics boylston 319 harvard university cambridge ma 02138 crane @ ikaros . harvard . edu a linguistic database of classical greek this project will extend an existing parser for classical greek , expanding its database of stems to cover the majority of all words attested in the literary record , and will use this database to create a morphologically parsed database of more than 1 , 000 , 000 unique strings available in the tlg : in the end , we will publish the database of analyzed strings , the databases of stems and endings which drive the parser and the parser itself . the resulting databases are an essential piece of scholarly infrastructure that will ( 1 ) revolutionize current searching techniques for the tlg and other greek databases , ( 2 ) make it possible to apply more sophisticated retrieval / text analysis to greek texts , and ( 3 ) provide a basic but crucial lookup tool that will aid non-specialists in other fields ( e . g . , philosophy , political science , religion ) who seek to work directly with the greek database . note : this document is a sketch for a possible proposal to be submitted to the neh at the end of august 1992 . it is , in effect , a proposal for a proposal and is thus open to revision on any and all points .",Safe Email

Well, if you have a Windows, SCO, or AIX box, (generally anything BUT Redhat Linux) that'd be the site I'd send you to, to get it installed.  I've been there for the same reason, under SCO.

"Hello folks!
I'm new to Linux, so here goes...
I've been trying to get connected to the outside world through my modem.
I've got Debian with kernel 2.4.18.
I've got this Win-Modem(yes, I know) and managed to locate a proper driver
for it.
Minicom is very much able to dial out.
But there seems to be a problem with my PPPD installation.
When I type 'ppp' in the minicom terminal, all I get (after the initial info
of my dynamic IP, etc) is a ~ and then the NO CARRIER signal.
Then I looked into calling pppd directly using chat.
I used this command:  pppd call Provider (where Provider is some script
somewhere).
It dials, it connects, it sends my username & password, and when connection
is established, it gives the SIGHUP signal and exits.
This is confirmed when me friend and I tried to connect through a serial
port using pppd to connect ttyS0.  I ran pppd waiting for a connection, me
friend tried connecting and as soon as he did, pppd exited.Some expert help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sick and tired of
having to reboot, get into Windoze to hook up to the net and then back to
Linux, mounting this drive to get that file, etc.  It'd be nice never have
to go back to Windoze(except for games, that is).Thanks a million.

THE MISSING LINK | Scot has cyber tomb with a viewSometimes an epitaph just can't be the last word. Billy Kemp was a
great Scot who died a couple of years ago at the young age of 52. He
was a councilman, husband, father and pillar of his community. His
family couldn't possibly post all that on a tombstone. But they did
manage to fit http://www.billykemp.org.uk/ on there. Yep, Kemp's
tombstone doubles as a billboard for his Web site, created
posthumously by his son as a tribute to his father's life. The grave
site has gotten more than 33,000 hits, perhaps more visits than the
gravesite!SOURCE: vnunet

Numerous Linux distros are available that >let you boot a stateless but functional system from CD-ROM.But RAM is expensive, and the directory structures of many systems (e.g. Windows) are not sufficiently organized and standardized to make this combination of bootable CDs and RAM drives practical. Even if you are fortunate enough to be using Linux (or another FHS-compliant *nix), you still can't fit a lot on a CD. Its not unusual today to have gigabytes of static multimedia content on the web server. This particular problem can be alleviated somewhat by using DVDs, but this is a temporary solution at best which will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard drives become cheaper.>> Obviously, you can't do this with partitions that accrue important >> state, e.g. a partition that stores database table data.>... but if you *do* want some state to persist, then you need a >mountable writable partition.

This is why you would consolidate all state of any long-term significance on just a couple partitions, and why you would not put static application code on these changeable partitions. Fortunately, most large client/server application physical architectures do this anyhow, because these are two fundamentally different kinds of state with two very different sets of administrative, security, RAID, and backup requirements. People also tend to do this anyhow because layered logical architectures are popular with the GUI at one end, business logic in the middle, and persistence services at the other. This logical architecture maps naturally to a physical architecture that has a static web server, a static application server, and a database server that has static and changeable partitions. (I use the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritable because the ""unchangeable"" partitions might be written to for temporary swap space. Who knows what Windows does internally?)My point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware RAID device that can split designated partitions into a permanent base image partition and a temporary delta image partition, that has some simple but solid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification of base images, and that can be configured to clear the delta image when the server is rebooted. If some vendor wished to implement this, they could then market this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that rely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer overflows, platform and middleware bugs, etc. The prevention of unauthorized modification of application data, of course, would not be addressed by this particular product. But there are many other techniques out there to defend application data. But those techniques all assume that your system itself has not been compromised at a lower level, which is where this product could help.I would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a hardware RAID vendor to implement. (I'm just guessing, of course, with no knowledge of how hardware RAID works internally.) If anyone knows of such a product, I'd love to hear about it.Ben",Safe Email

""" syntax and the comparative method concerning syntax and the comparative method : if i understand it correctly , amr @ ares . cs . wayne . edu ( no name ) apparently believes that under certain circumstances one can indeed use syntax as part of the comparative method and cites among other things , the case of a neuter plural in classical greek and old iranian used with a verb in the singular and its possible implications for a similar structure in the proto - language . while i do in theory believe that a particular construction can indeed survive the ravages of time and give us clues to the syntax of earlier levels , this must always be the last criterium we apply and can almost never be used as a sort of proof - unless of course , ( i believe scott de lancey mentioned it , but i ' m not sure ) we can show that , for example , all ergative case endings ( i believe the example was tibeto - burman ) can be traced back to a common form and the morphology , when reconstructed from the 'd aughter ' languages , conclusively points , in this case , to an ergative ' mother ' language . otherwise , john cowan seems to have summed it up best , citing robbin burling 's book : man 's many voices . . . just as every language at one point or another borrows lexemes from another langauge , there are literally thousands of examples of langauges borrowing syntactic constructions from other languages , whether substrats or not - even english has a good share of these borrowings . we cannot forget that an extremely large portion of the world 's population is by necessity bi - or tri-lingual , many of whom cannot even read their own native language , not to mention the other ( s ) or have any kind of linguistic training or sensiti - vity and would therefore pay much attention as to what language a particular construction comes from . there are also the famous ' sprachbunds ' , such as the balkan area and to a certain extent south asia , where through everyday necessity , a large part of the population speaks at least two langauges , as was shown in the case of the village along the maharastra - mysore boundary , ( mentioned by john cowan above ) where one can translate word-for - word from one language into another , although the languages are not - strictly speaking - related . in this case , though , it does n't even seem to make sense to speak of language families . in my opinion , the only possible connection is that of language contact or sprachbund . maybe that is part of the problem - what are ' related ' languages , anyway ? we must also remember that this process has undoubtedly been going on ever since people could speak . it would n't be difficult to propose , going back to our starting point , a theoretical language contact area for greek and iranian . for example , georgian , at least the modern language , only uses the plural verb for humans . although objects can appear in the plural , the verb appears in the singular . as there have always been greek ' colonies ' throughout the region , one could just as well assume a kind of sprachbund for the whole region at that time , which would be even easier as we know so little about the pre-historic era in that region , making it difficult to disprove . even today , there are certain ' areal ' characteristics such as evidential perfects , and many languages are , or have been at one point , split ergative in the region stretching from nepal to the caucusus , etc . seen in this light , then , we can't really speak of the ' oddity ' of the construction with a neutral plural taking a verb in the singular , which , by the way , in my opinion at least , does have a certain semantic justification and is by no means ' odd ' . concerning indo - aryan , the comparative method applied to syntax would certainly give us the ( wrong ) conclusion that vedic sanskrit was a split-ergative language , as all modern indo - aryan languages except standard oriya and begali ( and assamese ? ) are either ergative or split - ergative languages , and many dialects of these three langauges are also split-ergative languages . as there are several hundred ia ' langauges ' , would n't we be forced to assume that this goes back to the parent language ? but there is also a problem here with the traditional method . we have ( to a large extent ) cognate endings for the ergative case . so why is n't vedic a split-ergative language ? because we have gone back too far . split ergativity is part of the ' parent ' language , but this is presumably to be found in middle indic . for a language family about which we know next to nothing , then , this would certainly lead to tremendous errors . so , it seems to me that , although there are indeed useful insights to be gained by looking at the syntax , it should , as i stated earlier , always be the last criterium , if used at all , in arguing for a kind of genetic relationship . when we have no written history of the peoples of the area , very little in the way of documented sound changes , etc . , we simply cannot say anything yet about the syntactic structure of the proto-language . that will undoubtedly come about in the course of time , but it is just one of many features , none of which alone can ' prove ' anything , except perhaps contact . if there are enough of the ' unlikely ' correspondences ( i . e . ' ist / sind ' and ' est / sunt ' ) , then one can speak with relative security of a genetic relationship , whatever that exactly means . john peterson , kiel , germany",Safe Email

"6 . 136 language and species just a brief remark a propos of bemji wald 's comment on chomsky 's comment on whether apes can be shown to command ' reflexivization ' ; in particular the question of whether recognizing your image in a mirror as 's elf ' would be a sign of that ability . if it 's of interest , cats have a very peculiar relationship with mirrors . in my experience , most cats do not recognize images in mirrors , or tv , etc . as three-dimensional at all , and simply disregard them . but there are smart cats who do recogtnize their own images as cats in mirrors : but almost invariably as ' non-self ' . the typical reaction of a cat seeing itself in a mirror , if it 's a ' recognizer ' , is to bristle and hiss and go into defense-mode , or sometimes attack-mode . this of course raises what i like to call the dr doolittle problem : since we can't talk to animals we have to anthropomorphise and try to guess by analogy what they might be doing , but have no sense of what it feels like to be doing whatever . but in any case reflexivity is a bad example , because in general most animals do not have , in nature , any opportunity to see themselves ; animals that do confront mirror - like objects a lot ( say surface predators that hunt under water like herons , some cats , raccoons ) probably must deliberately as it were disregard the image they see , because they have to concentrate on refraction and what 's below the surface . roger lass department of linguistics university of cape town",Safe Email

Over on Arstechnica (www.arstechnica.com) I saw mention of a Wired article
that goes into the many wonderfull ways Apple is showing its love and
respect for its users.http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,55395,00.htmlThere is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over at
http://arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/macosx-10.2/macosx-10.2-5.html""True to form, industrious third party developers saw that they could gain
a competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface in
their applications. Apple's private menu extras APIs were reverse
engineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popular
that an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (third
party or otherwise) was in development.All of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because the
private APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would have
updated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have
resigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first
place.But what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly
exclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.
But when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of
""known"" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, it
is not allowed to load.It's easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer's sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants
""developers, developers, developers!"", but Microsoft clearly understands
something that Apple is still struggling with. It is in a platform
vendor's best interest to encourage development for its platform. In
Apple's case, this doesn't mean that they have to bend over backwards to
make every single system service and UI element ""pluggable"" via public
APIs. That's clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be the
number one priority for an OS in its infancy. And in the meantime, if
third party developers want to sell into a market that requires the
desired functionality to be added in ""unsupported"" ways, then they must be
prepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions.But for Apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developer
effort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing to
provide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish. """,Safe Email

"summary : basic order ( and remarks on typology ) last week i asked for references to discussions of a problem that comes up in linguistic typology : when there are conflicting or ambiguous criteria for deciding whether a particular language is a particular ' type ' with respect to some feature ( word order , clause alignment , or whatever ) , how does one decide how to assign that language ? i would like to thank the following for their helpful replies : george huttar , yehuda falk , dan everett , larry trask , jon aske , mike maxwell , mark newson , bill croft , georgia green , ingo plag , randy harris , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy . i was quite surprised at the small amount of published attention that there is to this problem . i was pointed to short discussions ( no more than a couple pages ) in some of the major works devoted to typology : the seminal greenberg paper , comrie 's ' language universals and linguistic typology ' , croft 's ' typology and universals ' , and hawkins ' ' word order universals ' . it was also suggested that i look at doris payne 's ' the pragmatics of word order ' and to papers on yagua by payne and dan everett and on tzotzil by judith aissen . what prompted my query was a reading of johanna nichols ' linguistic diversity in space and time , which i found extremely impressive . but all through it i had an uneasy feeling caused by her pigeon-holeing languages as ' svo ' , ' head-marking ' , ' active-stative ' , or whatever . since so many languages are * not * transparently one particular ' type ' on the surface , i wondered what the basis for these type-characterizations was . there is no general answer given to this question for an obvious reason : neither nichols or anyone else could have profound first-hand knowledge of more than a small handful of the 174 languages in the data base . i suspect that in most cases nichols could not know what criteria were applied to type a language in the sources she consulted , because many sources are insufficiently explicit on that point or take as self-evident some categorization that another would take as controversial or simply wrong . ( consider , for example , her typing french as vso . ) there were , to be sure , cases where nichols threw out some language from the sample of some particular feature because of its obvious ambiguous status with respect to that feature . but doing so could have created more problems than it solved . as both aske and croft pointed out in their postings to me , if a language is ' inconsistent ' with respect to a particular feature , that too is typological data ; data moreover that could be highly relevant to conclusions about stability and diversity over time . in a sample of 174 languages , misassignment of several languages within a category with a 3 - way division could lead to rather different conclusions . likewise , so would postulating a different set of categories or having categories specifically for ' mixed ' types . this is beginning to sound like a critique of nichols , but i do n't mean it to be . rather , it is more a commentary on the shaky art of typological pigeon-holeing that underlies not just conclusions about language prehistory , but also much functionalist theorizing and - - increasingly - - generative theorizing as well . there is also the question of sample * size * . typologists strive , quite reasonably , to correct for genetic and areal biases in their samples ( the most heroic effort along these lines that i know of is dryer 's work ) . but how confident can we be of any attempt to eliminate bias from the sample , given nichols ' conclusions that influences can extend half-way around the globe ? and does n't that present a challenge to purported explanations of the relative frequency of some typological feature , which are common in the functionalist literature and increasingly so in the generative ? so much could be the result of historical accident on the one hand and contact and descent on the other , rather than the product of ' external ' functional forces or the design of ug . the smaller the sample of languages where mutual influence or common descent is not a possibility , the more likely that some implicational typological relation is artifactual . and the more reason we have to think that there are a lot of typologically possible but - - purely by chance - - nonexisting languages . fritz newmeyer fjn @ u . washington . edu ps : with respect to the last point , alan bell has shown that if some feature appears in 1 % of the world 's languages ( say , 40-50 languages ) , it will show up only about 50 % of the time in a random sample of 75 languages . you 'd need a sample of over 200 languages before it could be counted on to show up 90 % of the time . and we are assuming here , utterly counterfactually , that there are no genetic relations or areal influences between languages .",Safe Email

"http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,806695,00.htmlWeevil pest warms to life in south-west LondonJames Meek, science correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The GuardianThey're chomping in Chelsea, Fulham and Pimlico, but despite their fancy
taste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: they
are vine weevils and they want to eat your plants.
Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's cold
winters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also been
detected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
""This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory,"" said
Max Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London
who discovered the creatures in the UK.
The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormous
damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species,
otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known
north of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. ""It's very likely
these weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental
plants from Italy,"" said Dr Barclay. ""It looks like they're here to stay.""
He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store
in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a
migrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in
south-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has
established itself firmly in the same area.
Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and
grape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The
soil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.
One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of
Britain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a
fact.

The installation goes nicely until the Xwindows setup. My graphics card IS detected but not the monitor. I have  
randomly chosen various LCD laptop display monitors but none seem to work, problem is that when i test a  particular

take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do not make any other changes . save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 3 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going : method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you and those involved send out only 10 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receive only a 0 . 2 % response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0 . 2 % . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e - mails instead of only 10 , 000 each ) . continuing with this example , you send out only 10 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 20 orders for report # 1 . those 20 people responded by sending out 10 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 200 , 000 . out of those 200 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that ' s = 400 people responded and ordered report # 2 . those 400 people mail out 10 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 4 million e - mails sent out . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 8000 orders for report # 3 . that ' s 8 , 000 orders times $ 10 each = $ 80 , 000 . 00 . your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 200 + 2 . . . . . $ 4 , 000 + 3 . . . . . $ 80 , 000 + . . . . . . . . grand total = $ 84 , 200 . 00 numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out he worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! remember friend , this is assuming only 20 people ordering out of 10 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 10 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ available reports _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 10 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper . write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 : "" the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net "" order report # 1 from : anthony henry 1374 utah street san francisco , ca 94110 usa report # 2 : "" the insider ' s guide to sending bulk e - mail on the net "" get a free bonus report : "" how to become a millionaire utilizing mlm & the net "" order report # 2 and get your free report from : ivan viaz 2119 n meade chicago , il 60639 usa report # 3 : "" the secret to multilevel marketing on the net "" get a free bonus report : "" how to send 1 million e - mails for free "" order report # 3 and get your free report from : renee nunez 4931 w hutchinson st chicago , il 60641 usa $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do not receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do . after you have received 20 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 200 orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . once you have received 200 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in !

    Message-ID:  <23204.1031891193@dimebox>  | 1) Right click on the folder label in the folder listThat (the way I have it configured, and it sounds as if the way Tony does
too) just does a move (rather than select as target without moving).Of course, if you can manage to get no messages currently selected, then
it works fine.  | 2) In the main window, the ""+"" key puts you into a ""change 
  |    folder"" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
  |    hit a second + and you go to ""set a target"" mode.  Type a few
  |    characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.This works, but is not nice if you're not using the keyboard, but just
the mouse.Tony: I agree - a nice way to link in one click would be good, and should
be easy to add, though currently adding mouse bindings (something like
shift right click would be a good choice) is much harder than adding
key bindings.But note there's no need to ""undo"" - the way I generally use link, if
the desired destination folder isn't the current selected target, is
to right click on the target, which selects it and moves the message,
(and because I have the ""automatic move to the next message on move or
link option set) select the message again, and then ""Link"".Exmh only permits one uncomitted action to be selected for a message at a
time, that is, one of delete, move, or link.   Selecting any of those
implicitly undoes any previous choice from the three (so you cannot
achieve a ""move"" by doing a link, then delete, then commit, it needs to
be link, commit, delete, commit).  (xmh was just the same there incidentally).  | How's spring shaping up ""down under""?No meaningful comment from me, I'm not there at the minute.   But I'm told
that where I'm from it is cold, wet, and miserable, though has been better
during the day (sunny days, cold nights) for the past few.    In any case,
all of that is a good enough reason to stay away...kre_______________________________________________

Date: Not suppliedA lot of people seem to be missing the point of Phoenix, as evidenced by the 
responses on Mozilla News[1] and MozillaZine[2]. Let me emphasize something 
here: if you think Mozilla's current UI is acceptable, then you are clearly not 
the target audience for Phoenix.Here is a quiz to test whether or not Phoenix is the right browser for you.
- The link toolbar is: 
- critical to my day-to-day use 
- vital when using Bugzilla! Doesn't everybody use Bugzilla?
-  link what?- The sidebar is 
- indispensable since i run at 1600x1200 resolution 
- not cool enough, since i can't float and dock all my panels and have 
splitters between all panels and see web page progress for individual HTML 
panels and check my email entirely from within sidebar and... 
- a waste of real estate- Form auto-fill 
- is not useful for me unless I can fill out 20 pages of personal information 
first 
- should just happen automatically- Downloads 
- should take place in a tree view with progress meters in the columns! 
- should be clearly visible and understandable.- Toolbars should 
- be dockable to all four corners of the screen, be able to float outside the 
window, be fully customizable such that I can make my own custom commands, be 
able to edit existing buttons' commands, be able to create my own toolbars, be 
able to put toolbars on the same line, and be able to edit the submenus and 
context menus of items (including the items on the menu bar) and browse my file 
system and cook me dinner and wash my car and walk my dog and do my taxes and 
mow my lawn and... 
- be customizable within reason- Composer should 
- always come with my browser. I want composer options all over my UI. 
Everywhere! 
- not be part of a Web browser.- Mail should 
- be part of my browser program. Aren't they the same app? There is a 
difference? 
- be a separate application.
Now to those people who want the full-blown functionality of the Mozilla trunk, 
you can still get that with Phoenix. The idea is to relegate more features to 
the ""optional add-on"" category. If you want the link toolbar or the sidebar or 
mouse gestures or any other features, you can download and install them 
yourself. I expect Phoenix will have a little add-in manager that will 
facilitate this process. There is currently an expectation on the part of an 
alarming number of people that every feature implemented by anyone should 
automatically be part of the default Mozilla install/download. Why? A layered approach scales better. You can then have a browser that can become 
as complex as you want to make it, but the choice is left in your hands. The 
geek features aren't inflicted on you by default.Finally, remember that Phoenix's UI is not controlled by Netscape. This is an 
opportunity for some of the core Mozilla Navigator developers to build the 
browser that they have always wanted to build, without having to compromise the 
user interface to satisfy the various conflicting pressures exerted by factions 
within Netscape.[1] http://www.mozillanews.org

Assuming the machines are networked, let each one send a copy of its kernel to
the others.  If the drives are open-the-box-and-switch-cables, then you can
start dd'ing a floppy before you start.  If the drives are in drawers, then this
might slow you down by all of 60 seconds.Alternatively, you could use netboot.  No, I'm serious.  Set the boot sequence
to first hard disk then network.  Do NOT make any partition on the standby
active.  Have a look at the etherboot package.  One of the things it contains is
a pascal-ish language for writing boot menus.  You can write a one-liner that
basically says ""boot /dev/hda1"" (or whatever, there's example code).  IIRC, the
resulting ""bootable image"" is a whopping 4K.  The downside is you'll need a
bootp and tftp server somewhere....hth,
Ronan.

Date: 2002-10-03T14:42:29-05:00_Jeffrey Zeldman_: Party like it's 1997[1]. â€œMicrosoft has redesigned. 
Its new layout uses font tags and other deprecated junk straight out of the 
mid-1990s. ... When a W3C member company that helped create XHTML and CSS 
ignores or misuses those web standards on its corporate site, you have to 
wonder who didn't get the memo.â€ The new design also fails even the most basic accessibility tests[2]; the home 
page contains 80 instances of images without ALT text. This is the same basic 
failing for which the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games was 
successfully sued in 2000[3]. Here is what microsoft.com looks like in a text-only browser[4]. (To better 
understand the experience, take a piece of paper and cover your entire monitor 
except for the top line, then scroll the window slowly so you can only read one 
line at a time.) While nothing is technically locked out (all the links are 
regular links, nothing requires Javascript to function properly), all the 
un-ALT-enhanced images (which are mostly spacer images and images-as-bullets) 
add so much clutter to the page that it's very difficult to navigate. Meanwhile, I don't want to imagine what it would sound like through a screen 
reader. Want to find the search box? That's â€œ1pttrans dot gif 1pttrans 
dot gif search for 1pttrans dot gif 1pttrans dot gif form edit box 1pttrans dot 
gif submit button go 1pttrans dot gif link advanced search 1pttrans dot gif 
...â€ And I hope you weren't looking for Microsoft's accessibility home

into a procmail environment.  Lots of people use it in many other ways.  For
performance reasons, many people run a spamd process and then invoke a small
C program called spamc which shoots the message over to spamd and passes the
result back out.  I think spambayes in incremental mode is probably fast
enough to not require such tricks (though I would consider changing the
pickle to an anydbm file).Basic procmail usage goes something like this:    :0fw

Â  07.16.2002 GnomeREPORT 
Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. 
Register for Gnomedex today!   Of the comments I received on AppleScript, every single one suggested I 
start with the basics, for that reason,  I'm going to take things 
step-by-step,  following my own learning process and progressing to 
gradually more difficult concepts. Despite having experience in 
programming, using a variety of languages, I initially found AppleScript 
to be quite intimidating -- mostly because something about the Script 
Editor seems less than intuitive. If you've already been dabbling in 
scripting, the first few columns on the subject will definitely be 
targeted at novices, but I want to everyone to have the chance to get 
up to speed.I'm off to the 
Shareware Industry Conference for the remainder of the week, 
where it's looking like the selection of stuff for Mac users will be very 
bleak. I believe the organization is targeted more toward the Windows 
community in general and any shareware developer with enough cash to get 
there is probably going to be in New York for MacWorld. I'll be missing 
out on the Web cast of Steve Jobs speech, which is scheduled to take place 
while I'm in the car, but at least I'll be able to catch the details at 
other Mac sites when I get to St. Louis. Internet access for the trip is 
being provided by Crosspaths.net, which is one of the few dialup services 
I've found that can be configured to relay my Lockergnome mail so that I 
can still function on the road. I tested the service on my iBook this 
evening just to be sure.With some luck, I may be able to get Internet access from the highway, via 
my Kyocera 6035, and see what Jobs had to say before I get to St. Louis. 
Unfortunately, there's no support for OS X yet with the 6035, so I can't 
use the unlimited nights and weekends to dial the Web from my laptop. A 
landline will probably be more sensible anyway. Check my blog for some 
updates on the trip, Lori's attending too and I'm sure she'll be taking 
lots of photos, as usual.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Jake LudingtonÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeDOWNLOADS
Same-X v2.0 [1.73MB] OSX 10.1.1 FREE
http://www.thumpbunny.com/Seven themes, two board sizes and your choice of difficulty levels, makes 
this a game for the entertainment addict in all of us. The object is to 
clear the board of all icons, removing them in matching clusters of two 
or greater at a time. Clearing the screen awards bonus points and scoring 
awards clearing of larger clusters. Nothing gets killed, there's no 
swearing, but you'll find yourself addicted to the mindless fun anyway -- 
not to mention you can feel safe sharing this with kids.
Â GnomeNETWORK
Samba Sharing Package v1.5 [8.3MB] OS X FREE
http://xamba.sourceforge.net/ssp/It remains to be seen whether 10.2 will render this type of application 
unnecessary, but for those out there without the cash to spend on DAVE, 
for small office or home networking of Mac/PC mixed environments, this 
is the only real alternative. Installation and configuration is almost 
painless, making it easy for your Windows machine to see apps on your 
Mac with little difficulty. The interface, like most OS X GUI apps, is 
quite easy to navigate, including user management, connection 
management, and share configuration into a convenient Prefernce pane.Â GnomeSCRIPT
Technically speaking, you could do most of your script writing in a text editing 
application like TextEdit, but ultimately you've got to compile it in the Script 
Editor, so you might as well start there. The Script Editor is located in the 
AppleScript subfolder of your Applications folder. Opening the application for 
the first time reveals a small window divided in to two sections, Description 
and the actual scripting pane, separated by a group of buttons.Ignore the buttons for the moment and concentrate on the two text panes. The 
Description pane is where you label your script, so you can remember later what 
it does. This is also the place you denote the key combination that will invoke 
your script. If you choose to save your script as an executable application, the 
information in the description will show up in the start up screen.The second pane is where the magic happens. In this pane you will be telling 
applications to do specific tasks when your script runs. The format for scripting 
is fairly linear. You either start your script at the top most level drilling 
down, until you actually reach the application or object you want to manipulate 
with your script, or you take the reverse approach manipulating things from the 
bottom up. Telling the ""Applications"" folder to tell its ""Jake"" subfolder to tell 
the application ""Jake's Media Player,"" located in that folder to do something 
could also be written by telling the script to access ""Jake's Media Player"" 
located in the ""Jake"" subfolder of the ""Applications folder,  The upcoming example 
will make this a bit more clear.Buy One Inkjet Cartridge - GET TWO FREE!!

Â GnomeTIPTraditionally, Mac OS has always placed a link to various disks in use on the 
desktop, which can be convenient, but is no longer necessary with the Finder 
only a Command+Tab away in the Dock. My personal desktop is usually cluttered 
with files I've downloaded from the Internet, so I can never find anything 
when my desktop is in plain sight, the Finder is the only way I stay organized. 
For desktop slobs like me, or for neat freaks who want nothing on the desktop, 
OS X includes three handy options for keeping disks in their place. Open the 
Finder Preferences window and uncheck the three checkboxes under Show these 
items on the Desktop. You'll have more space for other icons to clutter the 
desktop or in the case of you clean folk, you'll have nothing at all.Tip by Jake

32 Easy Ways To Breath New Life Into Any Webpage
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Â Â Â Â Â  It's true.
Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.Â  They'll
tell you it's true.Â  Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen
Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.Â  They'll agree
100% that it's true.Â  Don't just take my word for it.
In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
it is absolutely true.
It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.Â  Really, they
can.Â  But, it takes several very important components to
join the 5% who are successful on the web.
Â Â Â Â  One of those necessities is a website.
Â Â Â Â  Now, your website does one of two things...
Â Â Â Â  ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
not produce results.
And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
Poor sales letters.
Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
your sales letter...
1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
sales letter to.Â  Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
next door neighbor or your cat.Â  Write your sales letter
just like you are writing it to them personally.Â  Why?
Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
to be read to an audience rather than one person.Â  Keep your
sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
going to read them.
2) Use an illustration to get your point across.Â  In my
sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
across Montana on a grizzly bear.Â  Leads have read of how
getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
a solid message.Â  Tell stories that illustrate a point you
are trying to make.Â  Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
account from the ""real world.""Â  It effectively creates
interest and further establishes the point.
3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
line.Â  Your first line of the sales letter should
immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
more.Â  Go back to the beginning of this article.Â  The first
words were, ""It's true.""Â  I can guarantee you that either
consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?""
Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
about.Â  Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
paragraphs into this article.Â  Carefully craft your first
line.Â  If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
you've got a winner.
4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.Â  Shortly after
your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
list of benefits to absorb.Â  Hit them with your best shot.
Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
important things the reader will discover.Â  By offering a
killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
copy.Â  After all, if they are already interested after the
first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
finding out even more reasons why your product or service
will aid them.
6) Just let it all flow out.Â  Write down everything that
enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
can edit it later.Â  If you just sit and start writing
everything you know about your product or service and how it
will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
information floods your mind.Â  Write it ALL down.Â  Then read
through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
many of the points.Â  Edit it after you have exhausted all
of your ideas.
7) Make your sales letter personal.Â  Make sure that the
words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my.""
Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
yourself.Â  I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about
your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""Â  Leads aren't
interested in you or your products, they are interested in
themselves and their wants and needs.Â  When you are finished
with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.Â  It's a free service.Â  Make sure it's
at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
8) Write like you speak.Â  Forget all of those rules that
your grammar teacher taught you.Â  Write your sales letters
in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because.""
Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
Hemingway.
9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.Â  Use short
paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
afraid to use short sentences.Â  Like this one.
Or this.
See what I mean?Â  Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
force the reader to get distracted.
10)Â  Stress the benefits, not the features.Â  Again,
readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it
forÂ  me?""Â  What need is it going to meet? What want is it
going to fill?Â  How is your product or service going to be
of value or benefit to the reader?Â  Spell it out.Â  Don't
focus on the features of your product or service , but
rather how those features will add value to the life of your
reader.
For example:Â  If you are selling automobile tires, you may
very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
we are traveling.Â  So, instead of focusing on your selection,
you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
the benefits, not the features.
11) Keep the reader interested.Â  Some sales letters read
like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
understand.Â  Unless you are writing to a very targeted
audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
and information that are easy to understand and follow.
12) Target your sales letter.Â  When you are finished with
your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
specific audience.Â  For example: If you are selling a ""work
at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
women who are homemakers.Â  Then, rewrite the same sales
letter and target it to college students.Â  Write another
letter targeting senior citizens.Â  Still another could be
written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
during summer vacation.Â  The possibilities are endless.
All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only
5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only
5 hours a week.""Â  Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
(you could easily target 100's of groups).
Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
mediums.Â  You could advertise the ""College Students"" page
in a campus ezine.Â  The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be
advertised at a retirement community message board.
By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
to.Â  And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
match made for them.
13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.Â  Use short sentences
and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
letters...
Â Â Â Â  ...is to use a pause like this.
Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's
get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
HERE to continue.""
14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.Â  When the
customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.""
If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
that let the mouse get away.""Â  Use words to create a picture
in the readers' mind.Â  When you think of Superman, what
comes to mind?Â  Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
than a speeding bullet.""Â  ""More powerful than a locomotive.""
""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how
word pictures stick in our minds?
15) Focus on one product or service.Â  Don't try to sell
your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
confuses the reader.Â  Keep your ad copy directed at one
specific product or service.Â  Then, use other products and
services as back-end products.
16) Make it stand out.Â  Don't kid yourself.Â  There are
hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
same thing you are doing.Â  How will you stand out among the
crowd?Â  Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
breathe of originality.Â  Your product or service is
different. It's not like all of the rest.Â  It is unique.
Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
competition.Â  It must create a feeling of ""You won't find
this anywhere else.""
17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
Delete.Â  Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
something?Â  Get real.Â  Don't make outrageous claims that
are obviously not the truth.Â  You'll ruin your reputation.
Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
reversed.Â  Once you have been branded a liar, you will
NEVER be anything but a liar.Â  It doesn't matter if you
launch the most respectable, honest business available
anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
remember the crazy stuff you've said before.Â  Be believable.
Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
rather be EXACT.Â  Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing
information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
mind.Â  ""What am I really getting here?Â  Does he even know?""
When you use specific information, the reader begins to
think, ""This person must have counted.Â  I know exactly what
I can expect.""Â  ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the
human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude
Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They
leave no impression whatsoever.""
19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
want to know about your product or service.Â  Answer all of
their questions, anything they would want to consider before
making a purchase.Â  Think about it from their point of view.
Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""Â  Then, address that
in your sales letter.Â  Remove anything that would keep the
reader from making the purchase.
20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.Â  Share actual
excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
your product or service. Many websites have an entire
section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
compliments listed.Â  Satisfied customers remove some of the
doubt in the mind of the reader.Â  ""If these people have
found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
probably will too.""Â  Especially effective are testimonials
from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
field.
21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
ad copy.Â  Use them frequently -but don't overuse.Â  A well-
placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.Â  They are
that important.
22) Avoid asking stupid questions.Â  ""Wouldn't you like to
make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would
you like to be as successful as I am?""Â  Avoid any question
that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
feel like they are inferior.
23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
to influence them to buy in the future.Â  By offering a free
item, you canÂ  request their email address in order to
obtain the freebie.Â  By doing this, you can now follow-up
with the customer for a potential future sale.
Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
product or service which impresses the customer, they
probably will be back as a customer soon.
24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.Â  One of the things
that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
I am offering.Â  Ginsu made this one famous. They were
selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
the credibility of your main offer.
25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more""
and ""But that's not all.""Â  These phrases effectively lead
the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
leads into bonus items.Â  Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
value and benefits to the reader.
26) Always include a deadline.Â  By including a deadline,
you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
bonuses.""Â  ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
I've got to hurry.""Â  Let the customer know what they will
be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
are very effective.Â  Every sales letter should have one.
27) Tell them exactly how to order.Â  Be clear as to the
order process. Point them towards the order link.Â  Tell
them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
etc.)Â  Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
28)Â  Explain when the product will be delivered.Â  How
quickly will the order be processed?Â  When will the order be
available?Â  Let the customer know exactly what they can
expect when they place their order.Â  The more specific you
can be here, the better.Â  Let them know that you have a
system in place.Â  ""Operators are standing by.""Â  Their order
will be handled properly.Â  Tell them.
29) Offer a money back guarantee.Â  Take away their last
reason to hold back.Â  Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
guarantee.Â  Most people may not realize this, but in most
cases, it's the law of the land.Â  You are REQUIRED to give
them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
product or service.Â  Since it's the law anyway, why not make
it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
product or service RISK-FREE.
30) Instruct them to respond immediately.Â  Many people
just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""Â  ""Order today!""
""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""Â  You've got them
this far, now tell them what you want them to do.Â  Get them
to ""Act Fast!""Â  Have you ever heard a mail order commercial
on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
way?
31) Include a post script.Â  People will always read the
P.S.Â  Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT
parts of your sales letter. Why?Â  Because in many cases the
visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.Â  A
P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
description of what they will receive for their money. Use
your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.
32) Include a second post script.Â  You better believe
if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.Â  Use
this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
make them want to order.Â  I guarantee you they will read it.
Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see
a significant increase in the amount of responses you
receive from your sales letters.Â  In fact, it would be
impossible for your responses to not improve.

 32 Easy Ways To Breath New Life Into Any WebpageÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  It's true.
Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.Â  They'll
tell you it's true.Â  Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen
Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.Â  They'll agree
100% that it's true.Â  Don't just take my word for it.
In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
it is absolutely true.
It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.Â  Really, they
can.Â  But, it takes several very important components to
join the 5% who are successful on the web.
Â Â Â Â  One of those necessities is a website.
Â Â Â Â  Now, your website does one of two things...
Â Â Â Â  ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
not produce results.
And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
Poor sales letters.
Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
your sales letter...
1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
sales letter to.Â  Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
next door neighbor or your cat.Â  Write your sales letter
just like you are writing it to them personally.Â  Why?
Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
to be read to an audience rather than one person.Â  Keep your
sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
going to read them.
2) Use an illustration to get your point across.Â  In my
sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
across Montana on a grizzly bear.Â  Leads have read of how
getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
a solid message.Â  Tell stories that illustrate a point you
are trying to make.Â  Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
account from the ""real world.""Â  It effectively creates
interest and further establishes the point.
3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
line.Â  Your first line of the sales letter should
immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
more.Â  Go back to the beginning of this article.Â  The first
words were, ""It's true.""Â  I can guarantee you that either
consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?""
Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
about.Â  Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
paragraphs into this article.Â  Carefully craft your first
line.Â  If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
you've got a winner.
4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.Â  Shortly after
your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
list of benefits to absorb.Â  Hit them with your best shot.
Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
important things the reader will discover.Â  By offering a
killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
copy.Â  After all, if they are already interested after the
first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
finding out even more reasons why your product or service
will aid them.
6) Just let it all flow out.Â  Write down everything that
enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
can edit it later.Â  If you just sit and start writing
everything you know about your product or service and how it
will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
information floods your mind.Â  Write it ALL down.Â  Then read
through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
many of the points.Â  Edit it after you have exhausted all
of your ideas.
7) Make your sales letter personal.Â  Make sure that the
words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my.""
Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
yourself.Â  I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about
your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""Â  Leads aren't
interested in you or your products, they are interested in
themselves and their wants and needs.Â  When you are finished
with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.Â  It's a free service.Â  Make sure it's
at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
8) Write like you speak.Â  Forget all of those rules that
your grammar teacher taught you.Â  Write your sales letters
in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because.""
Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
Hemingway.
9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.Â  Use short
paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
afraid to use short sentences.Â  Like this one.
Or this.
See what I mean?Â  Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
force the reader to get distracted.
10)Â  Stress the benefits, not the features.Â  Again,
readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it
forÂ  me?""Â  What need is it going to meet? What want is it
going to fill?Â  How is your product or service going to be
of value or benefit to the reader?Â  Spell it out.Â  Don't
focus on the features of your product or service , but
rather how those features will add value to the life of your
reader.
For example:Â  If you are selling automobile tires, you may
very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
we are traveling.Â  So, instead of focusing on your selection,
you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
the benefits, not the features.
11) Keep the reader interested.Â  Some sales letters read
like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
understand.Â  Unless you are writing to a very targeted
audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
and information that are easy to understand and follow.
12) Target your sales letter.Â  When you are finished with
your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
specific audience.Â  For example: If you are selling a ""work
at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
women who are homemakers.Â  Then, rewrite the same sales
letter and target it to college students.Â  Write another
letter targeting senior citizens.Â  Still another could be
written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
during summer vacation.Â  The possibilities are endless.
All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only
5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only
5 hours a week.""Â  Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
(you could easily target 100's of groups).
Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
mediums.Â  You could advertise the ""College Students"" page
in a campus ezine.Â  The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be
advertised at a retirement community message board.
By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
to.Â  And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
match made for them.
13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.Â  Use short sentences
and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
letters...
Â Â Â Â  ...is to use a pause like this.
Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's
get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
HERE to continue.""
14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.Â  When the
customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.""
If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
that let the mouse get away.""Â  Use words to create a picture
in the readers' mind.Â  When you think of Superman, what
comes to mind?Â  Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
than a speeding bullet.""Â  ""More powerful than a locomotive.""
""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how
word pictures stick in our minds?
15) Focus on one product or service.Â  Don't try to sell
your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
confuses the reader.Â  Keep your ad copy directed at one
specific product or service.Â  Then, use other products and
services as back-end products.
16) Make it stand out.Â  Don't kid yourself.Â  There are
hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
same thing you are doing.Â  How will you stand out among the
crowd?Â  Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
breathe of originality.Â  Your product or service is
different. It's not like all of the rest.Â  It is unique.
Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
competition.Â  It must create a feeling of ""You won't find
this anywhere else.""
17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
Delete.Â  Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
something?Â  Get real.Â  Don't make outrageous claims that
are obviously not the truth.Â  You'll ruin your reputation.
Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
reversed.Â  Once you have been branded a liar, you will
NEVER be anything but a liar.Â  It doesn't matter if you
launch the most respectable, honest business available
anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
remember the crazy stuff you've said before.Â  Be believable.
Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
rather be EXACT.Â  Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing
information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
mind.Â  ""What am I really getting here?Â  Does he even know?""
When you use specific information, the reader begins to
think, ""This person must have counted.Â  I know exactly what
I can expect.""Â  ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the
human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude
Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They
leave no impression whatsoever.""
19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
want to know about your product or service.Â  Answer all of
their questions, anything they would want to consider before
making a purchase.Â  Think about it from their point of view.
Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""Â  Then, address that
in your sales letter.Â  Remove anything that would keep the
reader from making the purchase.
20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.Â  Share actual
excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
your product or service. Many websites have an entire
section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
compliments listed.Â  Satisfied customers remove some of the
doubt in the mind of the reader.Â  ""If these people have
found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
probably will too.""Â  Especially effective are testimonials
from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
field.
21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
ad copy.Â  Use them frequently -but don't overuse.Â  A well-
placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.Â  They are
that important.
22) Avoid asking stupid questions.Â  ""Wouldn't you like to
make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would
you like to be as successful as I am?""Â  Avoid any question
that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
feel like they are inferior.
23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
to influence them to buy in the future.Â  By offering a free
item, you canÂ  request their email address in order to
obtain the freebie.Â  By doing this, you can now follow-up
with the customer for a potential future sale.
Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
product or service which impresses the customer, they
probably will be back as a customer soon.
24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.Â  One of the things
that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
I am offering.Â  Ginsu made this one famous. They were
selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
the credibility of your main offer.
25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more""
and ""But that's not all.""Â  These phrases effectively lead
the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
leads into bonus items.Â  Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
value and benefits to the reader.
26) Always include a deadline.Â  By including a deadline,
you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
bonuses.""Â  ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
I've got to hurry.""Â  Let the customer know what they will
be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
are very effective.Â  Every sales letter should have one.
27) Tell them exactly how to order.Â  Be clear as to the
order process. Point them towards the order link.Â  Tell
them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
etc.)Â  Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
28)Â  Explain when the product will be delivered.Â  How
quickly will the order be processed?Â  When will the order be
available?Â  Let the customer know exactly what they can
expect when they place their order.Â  The more specific you
can be here, the better.Â  Let them know that you have a
system in place.Â  ""Operators are standing by.""Â  Their order
will be handled properly.Â  Tell them.
29) Offer a money back guarantee.Â  Take away their last
reason to hold back.Â  Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
guarantee.Â  Most people may not realize this, but in most
cases, it's the law of the land.Â  You are REQUIRED to give
them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
product or service.Â  Since it's the law anyway, why not make
it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
product or service RISK-FREE.
30) Instruct them to respond immediately.Â  Many people

Why We're So Nice: We're Wired to CooperateJuly 23, 2002
By NATALIE ANGIER 
 What feels as good as chocolate on the tongue or money in
the bank but won't make you fat or risk a subpoena from the
Securities and Exchange Commission? Hard as it may be to believe in these days of infectious
greed and sabers unsheathed, scientists have discovered
that the small, brave act of cooperating with another
person, of choosing trust over cynicism, generosity over
selfishness, makes the brain light up with quiet joy. Studying neural activity in young women who were playing a
classic laboratory game called the Prisoner's Dilemma, in
which participants can select from a number of greedy or
cooperative strategies as they pursue financial gain,
researchers found that when the women chose mutualism over
""me-ism,"" the mental circuitry normally associated with
reward-seeking behavior swelled to life. And the longer the women engaged in a cooperative strategy,
the more strongly flowed the blood to the pathways of
pleasure. The researchers, performing their work at Emory University
in Atlanta, used magnetic resonance imaging to take what
might be called portraits of the brain on hugs. ""The results were really surprising to us,"" said Dr.
Gregory S. Berns, a psychiatrist and an author on the new
report, which appears in the current issue of the journal
Neuron. ""We went in expecting the opposite."" The researchers had thought that the biggest response would
occur in cases where one person cooperated and the other
defected, when the cooperator might feel that she was being
treated unjustly. Instead, the brightest signals arose in cooperative
alliances and in those neighborhoods of the brain already
known to respond to desserts, pictures of pretty faces,
money, cocaine and any number of licit or illicit delights.
""It's reassuring,"" Dr. Berns said. ""In some ways, it says
that we're wired to cooperate with each other."" The study is among the first to use M.R.I. technology to
examine social interactions in real time, as opposed to
taking brain images while subjects stared at static
pictures or thought-prescribed thoughts. It is also a novel approach to exploring an ancient
conundrum, why are humans so, well, nice? Why are they
willing to cooperate with people whom they barely know and
to do good deeds and to play fair a surprisingly high
percentage of the time? Scientists have no trouble explaining the evolution of
competitive behavior. But the depth and breadth of human
altruism, the willingness to forgo immediate personal gain
for the long-term common good, far exceeds behaviors seen
even in other large-brained highly social species like
chimpanzees and dolphins, and it has as such been difficult
to understand. ""I've pointed out to my students how impressive it is that
you can take a group of young men and women of prime
reproductive age, have them come into a classroom, sit down
and be perfectly comfortable and civil to each other,"" said
Dr. Peter J. Richerson, a professor of environmental
science and policy at the University of California at Davis
and an influential theorist in the field of cultural
evolution. ""If you put 50 male and 50 female chimpanzees
that don't know each other into a lecture hall, it would be
a social explosion."" Dr. Ernst Fehr of the University of Zurich and colleagues
recently presented findings on the importance of punishment
in maintaining cooperative behavior among humans and the
willingness of people to punish those who commit crimes or
violate norms, even when the chastisers take risks and gain
nothing themselves while serving as ad hoc police. In her survey of the management of so-called commons in
small-scale communities where villagers have the right, for
example, to graze livestock on commonly held land, Dr.
Elinor Ostrom of Indiana University found that all
communities have some form of monitoring to gird against
cheating or using more than a fair share of the resource. In laboratory games that mimic small-scale commons, Dr.
Richerson said, 20 to 30 percent have to be coerced by a
threat of punishment to cooperate. Fear alone is not highly likely to inspire cooperative
behavior to the degree observed among humans. If research
like Dr. Fehr's shows the stick side of the equation, the
newest findings present the neural carrot - people
cooperate because it feels good to do it. In the new findings, the researchers studied 36 women from
20 to 60 years old, many of them students at Emory and
inspired to participate by the promise of monetary rewards.
The scientists chose an all-female sample because so few
brain-imaging studies have looked at only women. Most have
been limited to men or to a mixture of men and women. But there is a vast body of non- imaging data that rely on
using the Prisoner's Dilemma. ""It's a simple and elegant model for reciprocity,"" said Dr.
James K. Rilling, an author on the Neuron paper who is at
Princeton. ""It's been referred to as the E. coli of social
psychology."" >>From past results, the researchers said, one can assume
that neuro- imaging studies of men playing the game would
be similar to their new findings with women. The basic structure of the trial had two women meet each
other briefly ahead of time. One was placed in the scanner
while the other remained outside the scanning room. The two
interacted by computer, playing about 20 rounds of the
game. In every round, each player pressed a button to
indicate whether she would ""cooperate"" or ""defect."" Her
answer would be shown on-screen to the other player. The monetary awards were apportioned after each round. If
one player defected and the other cooperated, the defector
earned $3 and the cooperator nothing. If both chose to
cooperate, each earned $2. If both opted to defect, each
earned $1. Hence, mutual cooperation from start to finish was a far
more profitable strategy, at $40 a woman, than complete
mutual defection, which gave each $20. The risk that a woman took each time she became greedy for
a little bit more was that the cooperative strategy would
fall apart and that both would emerge the poorer. In some cases, both women were allowed to pursue any
strategy that they chose. In other cases, the non- scanned
woman would be a ""confederate"" with the researchers,
instructed, unbeknown to the scanned subject, to defect
after three consecutive rounds of cooperation, the better
to keep things less rarefied and pretty and more lifelike
and gritty. In still other experiments, the woman in the scanner played
a computer and knew that her partner was a machine. In
other tests, women played a computer but thought that it
was a human. The researchers found that as a rule the freely
strategizing women cooperated. Even occasional episodes of
defection, whether from free strategizers or confederates,
were not necessarily fatal to an alliance. ""The social bond could be reattained easily if the defector
chose to cooperate in the next couple of rounds,"" another
author of the report, Dr. Clinton D. Kilts, said, ""although
the one who had originally been `betrayed' might be wary
from then on."" As a result of the episodic defections, the average
per-experiment take for the participants was in the $30's.
""Some pairs, though, got locked into mutual defection,"" Dr.
Rilling said. Analyzing the scans, the researchers found that in rounds
of cooperation, two broad areas of the brain were
activated, both rich in neurons able to respond to
dopamine, the brain chemical famed for its role in
addictive behaviors. One is the anteroventral striatum in the middle of the
brain right above the spinal cord. Experiments with rats
have shown that when electrodes are placed in the striatum,
the animals will repeatedly press a bar to stimulate the
electrodes, apparently receiving such pleasurable feedback
that they will starve to death rather than stop pressing
the bar. Another region activated during cooperation was the
orbitofrontal cortex in the region right above the eyes. In
addition to being part of the reward-processing system, Dr.
Rilling said, it is also involved in impulse control. ""Every round, you're confronted with the possibility of
getting an extra dollar by defecting,"" he said. ""The choice
to cooperate requires impulse control."" Significantly, the reward circuitry of the women was
considerably less responsive when they knew that they were
playing against a computer. The thought of a human bond,
but not mere monetary gain, was the source of contentment
on display. In concert with the imaging results, the women, when asked
afterward for summaries of how they felt during the games,
often described feeling good when they cooperated and
expressed positive feelings of camaraderie toward their
playing partners. Assuming that the urge to cooperate is to some extent
innate among humans and reinforced by the brain's feel-good
circuitry, the question of why it arose remains unclear.
Anthropologists have speculated that it took teamwork for
humanity's ancestors to hunt large game or gather difficult
plant foods or rear difficult children. So the capacity to
cooperate conferred a survival advantage on our forebears. Yet as with any other trait, the willingness to abide by
the golden rule and to be a good citizen and not cheat and
steal from one's neighbors is not uniformly distributed. ""If we put some C.E.O.'s in here, I'd like to see how they
respond,"" Dr. Kilts said. ""Maybe they wouldn't find a
positive social interaction rewarding at all."" A Prisoner's Dilemma indeed.

Your first example is a good one, because I really think it's even easier
currently :
1. Leave your current kernel as-is
2. Get the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm
3. Rebuild and install resulting packagesDrivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem,
NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported
as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm.Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in
my mind. I see it more as a ""one size fits all"" achievement in the general
case. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimized
for various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules
you'll ever need. Make that ""one size fits many"" then if you want ;-)Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away from
in my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up their
systems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and
other major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily
use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release
without having their system turned into another Ximian mess.MatthiasPS: Yes Chris, I'm worried about not giving you too much work! Less in fact
since you can easily answer ""freshrpms.net!"" to people asking how to play
DVDs, right? ;-))))--

Date: Not suppliedThe Joint Hearing of the Senate Committee and Senate Select Committee on the 
Entertainment Industry is underway in LA, investigating artists' claims that 
the labels engage in unfair and corrupt business-practices. The first day's 
findings at the hearings are really quite remarkable:     By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to 
    third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, 
    consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently 
    this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the 
    initiative for artists' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief 
    Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA 
    members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared 
    information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but 
    supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared 
    his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the 
    hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for ""Hell Freezes 
    Over,"" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no 
    more than a 10% ""reserve"" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had 
    held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) 
    and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they 
    had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Paul!_)[1] http://www.musicdish.com/mag/?id=6675

"california update 4 / 27 / 01 the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please treat with discretion . executive summary : ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives . politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of out - of - state generators ? june lst "" kill clause "" for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal 1 . ferc fallout the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation . it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan . 2 . something less than effective price caps from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws : ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west . non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california . ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling . ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion . ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc . 3 . proposal "" kill clause "" adds to the political dilemma for davis the ferc proposal includes a "" kill clause "" that says the caps will be withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines blaming him for letting the "" bush price caps plan "" collapse . 4 . growing fiscal risk in california sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power . the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about 90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals . the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california . the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months . 5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts , since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline . 6 delays likely in new qf generation the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated . 7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a "" non - bypassable "" charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge . 8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis . even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged , creating an even further delay .",Safe Email

"uk linguists : invitation i am forwarding the following message on behalf of the people who are responsible for inspecting teaching in all our linguistics departments . please circulate to colleagues who do n't subscribe to linguist . xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx "" 18 november 1994 1995-96 higher education quality assessment programme as you may be aware , the higher education funding council for england ( hefce ) is required under the terms of the further and higher education act 1992 to secure that provision is made for assessing the quality of education in institutions for whose activities they provide financial support . the council has welcomed this obligation and sees assessment of education as a vitally important part of its work . assessments are carried out within specific subject areas and assessors , who are experts in their fields , visit institutions to judge the quality of the student learning experience that they observe . one of the eight subjects to be covered in the 1995-96 programme is linguistics . other subjects which are included and which could be linked in assessment with linguistics are german & related languages , french , russian & eastern european languages , italian , and iberian . the subject specialist assessors must have industrial , commercial or professional experience in their subject , coupled with a broad knowledge of higher education : it is unlikely that anyone at a junior level will have sufficient authority . the minimum commitment will be to take part in four assessments visits between april 1995 and september 1996 ( a total commitment of 20 days of which just 14 will require an absence from the workplace ) . each specialist assessor will be paid a per diem rate of l150 including vat , and travel and subsistence costs will be met by the council . full training will , of course , be received by assessors aimed at developing their assessment skills . this focuses particular attention on role and use of self-assessments , and on the conduct of assessment activities , including the protocol to be observed when carrying out assessment visits . further particulars on the role of subject specialist assessors can be found in circular 33 / 94 which has been sent to all he institutions in england , scotland and northern ireland . if any members of your association would be interested in becoming assessors , or even simply in finding out more about the role of an assessor without committing themselves , there is an informal meeting on 5 december in london and two others on 6 and 12 december in birmingham at which they would be most welcome . in which case , please contact shirley cook on 0272 317461 as soon as possible .

Date: 2002-10-03T01:31:51-05:00Remember that saying from chaos theory about how when a butterfly flap its 
wings, it can cause a hurricane a month later halfway around the world? As 
several people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their 
most recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used 
to be the #1 ""mark""[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an 
attempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and 
Google bombing[3]. Specifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked 
site, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the 
linked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for ""go to hell""
[4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for ""talentless hack""[6] 
no longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were 
previously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on 
whether Google is actively penalizing such sites. Unfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have 
caused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on 
medium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far 
as page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work 
putting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive 
with complaints and speculation: - New update, pagerank death?[8] 
- September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] 
- Let's find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] (Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no 
longer indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely 
false. Searching diveintomark.org for ""gimli""[11] finds my entry of July 29[12]
, where ""Gimli"" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) Regardless, Google's search results in general appear to be significantly 
degraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam 
sites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so 
good at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing 
frequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they're 
tracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It 
didn't take long. - Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a 
hotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems 
unhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and 
Google absolutely knows I'm in the US based on my IP address). 
- Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC 
newspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet 
betting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. 
- Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent 
site, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself 
(I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I 
didn't care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn't 
that helpful. Many people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com
[21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their 
results for ""eminem""[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the 
beginning of the end of Google's reign?[1]  http://www.google.com/search?q=mark

"I need to setup a VPN between a few sites. From what I've read, the the
choices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE.
It seems that FreeSWAN is 'better', being an implementation of IPsec which
is a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and is
somewhat simpler to setup. The problem is that it's not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sites
run OS-X. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation of
IPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only.So, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a
significant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ?
If CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whatever
on the OS-X sites) then I'll simply get a Linux box for each of the remote
sites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexity
in software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.Niall--

Caymanian Customs Wonder Dog at extreme close range, or heard the
story about the expat's college age kid, actually born on Cayman, who
was literally exiled from the island when the island constabulary
""discovered"" a marijuana seed or three in his summer-break rental car
a few years back.I mean, his old man was some senior cheese at Global Crossing at the
time, but this was back when they could do no wrong. If that's what
they did to *his* kid, imagine what some poor former
junk-bond-hustler might have to deal with someday for, say, the odd
unauthorized Cuban nightlife excursion. A discretely folded twenty
keeps the stamp off your passport on the ground in Havana, and a
bottle of Maker's Mark goes a long way towards some interesting
nocturnal diversion when you get there and all, but still, you can't
help thinking that Uncle's going to come a-knockin', and that Cayman
van's going to stop rockin' some day, and when it does, it ain't
gonna be pretty.
Closer to home, conceptually at least, a couple of cryptogeeken were
hustled off and strip-searched, on the spot, when they landed on
Grand Cayman for the Financial Cryptography conference there a couple
of years ago. Like lots of cypherpunks, these guys were active
shooters in the Bay Area, and they had stopped in Jamaica, Mon, for a
few days on the way to Grand Cayman. Because they, and their stuff,
reeked on both counts, they were given complementary colorectal
examinations and an entertaining game of 20 questions, or two,
courtesy of the Caymanian Federales, after the obligatory fun and
games with a then-snarling Crotch-Sniffing Caymanian Wonder Dog.
Heck, I had to completely unpack *all* my stuff for a nice, well-fed
Caymanian customs lady just to get *out* of the country when I left.
Besides, tax havens are being increasingly constrained as to their
activities these days, because they cost the larger nation-states too
much in the way of ""escaped"" ""revenue"", or at least the perception of
same in the local ""free"" press. Obviously, if your money ""there""
isn't exchangeable into your money ""here"", it kind of defeats the
purpose of keeping your money ""there"" in the first place, giving
folks like FinCEN lots of leverage when financial treaties come up
for renegotiation due to changes in technology, like on-line
credit-card and securities clearing, or the odd governmental or
quango re-org, like they are wont to do increasingly in the EU, and
the US.As a result, the veil of secrecy went in Switzerland quite a while
ago. The recent holocaust deposit thing was just the bride and groom
on that particular wedding-cake, and, as goes Switzerland, so goes
Luxembourg, and of course Lichtenstein, which itself is usually
accessible only through Switzerland. Finally, of course, the Caymans
themselves will cough up depositor lists whenever Uncle comes calling
about one thing or another on an increasingly longer list of fishing
pretexts.At this point, the ""legal"", state-backed pecuniary privacy pickings
are kind of thin on the ground. I mean, I'm not sure I'd like to keep
my money in, say, Vanuatu. Would you? Remember, this is a place where
a bandana hanging on a string across an otherwise public road will
close it down until the local erst-cannibal hunter-gatherer turned
statutorily-permanent landowner figures out just what his new or
imagined property rights are this afternoon.
The point is, any cypherpunk worth his salt will tell you that only
solution to financial or any other, privacy, is to make private
transactions on the net, cheaper, and more secure, than ""transparent""
transactions currently are in meatspace. Then things get *real*
interesting, and financial privacy -- and considerably more personal
freedom -- will just be the icing on the wedding cake. Bride and
groom action figures sold separately, of course.Cheers,
RAH
(Who went to FC2K at the Grand Cayman Marriott in February that year.
Nice place, I liked Anguilla better though, at least at the time, and
I haven't been back to either since. The beaches are certainly better
in Anguilla, and the ""private"" banking system there is probably just
as porous as Cayman's is, by this point. If I were to pick up and
move Somewhere Free outside Your Friendly Neighborhood Unipolar
Superpower, New Zealand is somewhere near the top of my list, and
Chile would be next, though things change quickly out there in
ballistic-missile flyover country. In that vein, who knows, maybe
we're in for some kind of latter-day Peloponnesian irony, and
*Russia* will end up the freest place on earth someday. Stranger
things have happened in the last couple of decades, yes?)-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

  IWT Bans RIAA From Accessing Its NetworkAugust 19, 2002Information Wave Technologies has announced it will actively deny the
Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) from accessing the
contents of its network. Earlier this year, the RIAA announced its new plan
to access computers without owner's consent for the sake of protecting its
assets. Information Wave believes this policy puts its customers at risk of
unintentional damage, corporate espionage, and invasion of privacy to say
the least.Due to the nature of this matter and RIAA's previous history, we feel the
RIAA will abuse software vulnerabilities in a client's browser after the
browser accesses its site, potentially allowing the RIAA to access and/or
tamper with your data. Starting at midnight on August 19, 2002, Information
Wave customers will no longer be able to reach the RIAA's web site.
Information Wave will also actively seek out attempts by the RIAA to thwart
this policy and apply additional filters to protect our customers' data.Information Wave will also deploy peer-to-peer clients on the Gnutella
network from its security research and development network (honeynet) which
will offer files with popular song titles derived from the Billboard Top
100 maintained by VNU eMedia. No copyright violations will take place,
these files will merely have arbitrary sizes similar to the length of a 3
to 4 minute MP3 audio file encoded at 128kbps. Clients which connect to our
peer-to-peer clients, and then afterwards attempt to illegally access the
network will be immediately blacklisted from Information Wave's network.
The data collected will be actively maintained and distributed from our
network operations site.The placement of this policy is not intended to hamper the RIAA's piracy
elimination agenda or advocate Internet piracy, but to ensure the safety of
our customers' data attached to our network from hackers or corporate
espionage hidden by the veil of RIAA copyright enforcement.If you have questions, comments, or concerns regarding this policy, please
e-mail riaa@informationwave.net.

"summary : french creole apres for progressive the original question concerned the use of apres in french creoles for the progressive rather than the perfect which would be expected on typological grounds . the enormous response precludes listing all who answered . it would seem that the moral of the story is that one should n't assume what is normal in any given case . in this instance , it was simply incorrect to assume that standard french en train de was normal ; in fact , it would appear that standard french has innovated in this respect . according to respondants , the apres construction for the progressive is found in many vernacular french 's including canadian , swiss and cajun . one would assume that the vernacular is the source of the creole progressive . the semantics of apres is only strange on the assumption that the form means "" after . "" it does appear that the vernacular progressive preserves the original sense of a - pres , which in fact conforms to expectations based on cross-linguistic study . in standard french , the corresponding expression is aupres . many respondents drew my attention to the "" after ving "" construction of english dialect . h . rogers at uoft informs me that the construction is a perfect and not a progressive ; i have since confirmed this analysis . in addition to welsh , scots gaelic has an "" after ving "" perfect that is the likely source of the construction . apparently the preposition in scots gaelic ( air ) now means "" on "" outside of the progressive construction ( an deigh "" after "" ) . thanks again to all who responded . it was an interesting exercise .",Safe Email

OPRAH, NIGHTLINE, MARIA SHRIVER, 48 HOURS, 20/20, 
PLAYBOY, KIPLINGERS and more have all interviewed this 
FAMOUS Private Investigator, seeking to find how he made 
his fortune.  Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using 
them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a 
Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very 
substantial income.Hereï¿½s the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against 
another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.
BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these 
SHOCKING FACTS:a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment
b) The court does not require the loser to pay you. 
c) The court will not help you to collect it. 
d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling 
you how to collect the judgment. All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They 
must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank 
accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER 
has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that 
BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an 
expense instead of an asset!  WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in 
files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the 
United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of 
uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 
5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting 
other peopleï¿½s judgments?  Thatï¿½s what we want to tell you.  
Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a 
process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper 
into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the 
techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time 
making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time 
associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per 
year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable 
organizations.Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing 
over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, 
new judgments become available every day.  The work is
ALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. 
This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start 
something ï¿½on the sideï¿½ that will offer a solid income in the future. 
It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to 
spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT 
A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.  
The more effort the bigger the reward.  You choose how much you 
want to make!If you've ever dreamed the American Dream financial freedom 
this may very well be the opportunity youï¿½ve been looking for.  
This business can also protect you from corporate downsizing. 
It might also be your ticket to freedom from others telling you what
to do. This business lets you control your destiny! You donï¿½t need 
to be a rocket scientist either! Our training has made this happen for 
many others already. Make it happen for you too!Take the first step and talk it over with one of our trained 
counselors by calling 1-720-733-7315.  Let them answer your 
questions so that youï¿½ll know if itï¿½s right for you.  There is no cost 
or obligation on your part except the cost of a phone call.  Join a small number of people who are reaping the BIG 
REWARDS, by calling us at 1-720-733-7315 today!",Phishing Email

Publishing, presents a simple shader trick that performs a good per pixel 
approximation of a non-integer power function. The technique works for input 
values between 0 and 1 and supports large exponents. The presented shader does 
not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend 
more instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents.

"Hi all,
I've run into a fairly intractable (for me) problem, and was wondering
if anybody could give me pointers on how to deal with it.I am running Debian Woody on a Pentium III IDE based system.
I have a Ricoh 7083a ide cd rewriter, which I use using cdrecord and the
scsi over ide kernel modules.  I was running kernel 2.4.18 until
probably last weekend when I noticed 2.4.19 was out.  Downloaded patch
and installed new kernel with no real problems.  This morning I went to
burn a CDROM, and the system locked hard.  Rebooting into 2.4.18 allowed
cdburning to work fine.This problem is very reproducible (on my system at least).
the cdrecord command I was using was
    cdrecord -v speed=4 blank=fast dev=0,1,0 -data bak.iso
The blanking appears to go ok, but when it tries to write data, it just
locks up the entire system (can't ping it from outside even).  AFAICS,
the system just stops.  Hard reset is only way back in, and when it does
reboot, I cannot see anything useful in any logfiles (/var/log/messages
/var/log/kern.log /var/log/syslog, at any rate).
cdrecord -scanbus works fine and reports the two pseudo-scsi devices (my
cdr drive and my cdrw).
The same lock occurs even if there is no blanking.I tried upgrading to 2.4.20-pre1-ac1 (on assumption that if there was a
kernel issue it might have been fixed in these patches), but it gives
the same error.  I also downloaded and compiled the source for
cdrecord 1.1.10, and installed it instead of the debian package (i was
wondering if maybe there was some compile option the packager had used
which maybe would cause the problem), and still the problem persisted.Anyway, I'm completely stumped.  Google searching has not done me much
good, and I'm a little bit lost.  What I'd like to know is
a)  How to fix the problem ;-)
b)  Is this likely to be an application or kernel problem?  The severity
    of the crash would make me suspect it is a kernel problem, but I'm
    not very knowledgeable on these things.
c)  Should I post a description of this to the kernel mailing list? If
    this is an appropriate course of action, are there any tips (beyond
    the guidelines on kernel.org)?Like I said, I'm lost on this one, so any info is very gratefully
received.

( gui display changes only at high level , not on path ) the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) , or not re - path if re - pathing occurs , the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info ) balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info ) the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all information is correct ) volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out .

( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths ) this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where nominations were sent for entire month ) can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing . unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response . what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? ) i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when these type of changes are needed . will keep you posted . thanks , dg from : thomas engel 04 / 05 / 2000 09 : 44 am to : kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect , peggy hedstrom / cal / ect @ ect , dianne seib / cal / ect @ ect cc : sylvia a campos / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , faye ellis / hou / ect @ ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect @ ect , scott mills / hou / ect @ ect , russ severson / hou / ect @ ect , martha stevens / hou / ect @ ect , karie hastings / hou / ect @ ect , regina perkins / hou / ect @ ect , imelda frayre / hou / ect @ ect , william e kasemervisz / hou / ect @ ect , hunaid engineer / hou / ect @ ect , steven gullion / hou / ect @ ect , larrissa sharma / hou / ect @ ect , donna greif / hou / ect @ ect subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution : if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the ability for you to invalidate the deal - and then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message : "" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure pipeline allows this change . "" some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback - i assume for the same reasons we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems ( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal . before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just in case it causes problems with their pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask the unify team . there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im market east - but not from ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be the same legal entity . "" warning - not the same legal entity "" also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals ( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) . once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items were locked down for a reason . if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down data that was validated - and someone used these deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted . always check with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in unify . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by thomas engel / hou / ect on 04 / 05 / 2000 09 : 47 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : scott mills on 04 / 04 / 2000 07 : 38 pm to : kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect cc : steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect , thomas engel / hou / ect @ ect , sylvia a campos / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , faye ellis / hou / ect @ ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect @ ect subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) . in addition , this release will also capture "" near - time "" the contract changes that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be necessary . new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal manager . new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) . once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you are looking for will appear . i mention "" near - time "" because we are constrained by the amount of time it takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then updates its information srm ( x 33548 ) cyndie balfour - flanagan @ enron 04 / 04 / 2000 03 : 41 pm to : connie sutton / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , scott mills / hou / ect @ ect , richard elwood / hou / ect @ ect , dave nommensen / hou / ect @ ect , kenneth m harmon / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect , gayle horn / corp / enron @ enron , brant reves / hou / ect @ ect , russell diamond / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect , steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : changes in global due to consent to assignment the following changes will be made in the global contracts database due to receipt of executed consent to assignment for the following contracts : current counterparty name contract type contract # ' new ' counterparty name ces - commonwealth energy services gisb 96029892 commonwealth energy services ces - samuel gary jr . & associates , inc gisb 96029302 samuel gary jr . & associates ces - south jersey gas company gisb 96029143 south jersey gas company cp name change and contract type correction ( contract type different than that provided by ces ) per ces ces - southwest gas corporation 1 / 1 / 98 gisb 96029146 per contract file ces - southwest gas corporation 04 / 14 / 93 master purchase / sale interruptible ( will edit global # 96029146 ) & ces - southwest gas corporation 12 / 01 / 94 master sale firm ( created new global record to accommodate this k , # 96037402 ) please note that southwest gas corporation has consented to the assignment of both of these contracts .",Safe Email

be the same as the backup disk.I can't think of a right way to do his with LILO.  I've got
a similar seup on my home machine (rsync to a backup disk
every night), but I'll be pulling out the RH install CDs to
get LILO sorted if I have to do a disk swap.GRUB should be able to handle this no problem, since it
doesn't record sector numbers like LILO does.  Not much help
for you though...Later,

releasing new rules and removing broken ones (all based on discussions on 
this list of course) in the 2.4 branch instead of creating a new 2.5 branch 
everytime we have a bunch of new rules.A new branch should be openend only if (big) new features are introduced 
(eg. Bayes) or the interface has changed (spam_level_char=x). As the rules 
are under fluent development, the user has to update quite regularly. But 
currently he couldn't be shure if the new release will break anything in 
his setup (like -F going away). So if we say ""the branches are stable to 
the outside and just improved under the surface but you have to watch out 
when you update to a new minor version number"", users and sysadmins could 
be less reluctant to update.All just IMHO :o)

5 Ways to Create a Unique Website
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Internet users have no doubt seen several websites of identical
design. This is often because webmasters do not have the
ability or time to design and create unique websites. These
five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind design
for your website.1. Navigation SystemDeciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
things to consider when designing your website. Visitors
usually look for a way to get to the information they want
before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your
navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase 
(http://www.webmasterbase.com) for example. There is a list 
of categories on the left, and information about the network 
on the top bar.It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
bottom of the page because:- People see the top of the page first
- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation gets
   pushed to bottom of the page... away from the visitor.2. Color SchemeWhen you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast. For
example, do not use bright green and florescent pink. Some
colors that are often used are white on black or black on
white.A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color Schemer
(http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/), created by Aaron
Epstein. Many other programs exist that can assist you in
choosing colors. Try doing a search on FreewareFiles 
(http://www.freewarefiles.com), Tucows (http://www.tucows.com),
or Download.com (http://www.download.com) for ""color schemer.""3. Content WindowThis is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text here
is easy to read and understand.Also, provide your own original content. People do not want to
hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear what 
you want to say! While it might be time consuming to write
your own content, it sure is worth it.To find content for your website, try searching at
EzineArticles (http://www.ezinearticles.com). Other people may
have used the articles, but if you become good friends with the
authors, they may send you new content as they write it. Be
careful though. Do not use too much content from other 
authors, as mentioned above.4. Font(s)Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is
fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.
Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to
Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can be 
used for long pieces of text.The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,
or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times
(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,
is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because
its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making it
easier to read.5. AdvertisingAh, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing 
that almost every website has. The most common type is what 
is known as ""banner"" advertising. It is called that because it is 
long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long you ask? The 
generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.New sizes however are being used. Take for example the new
style called ""skyscraper"" -- so called for a reason: it looks
like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not too
wide (about 100-125 pixels.)Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners 
used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the page.
Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in the middle
of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.    ConclusionThese are only five things to consider when designing a
website. There are many others however. Let me know what 
you find that helps you create a unique website. My email

 5 Ways to Create a Unique Websiteï¿½ï¿½Internet users have no doubt seen several websites of
identical design. This is often because webmasters do not
have the ability or time to design and create unique websites.
These five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind
design for your website.
1. Navigation System
Deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
things to consider when designing your website. Visitors
usually look for a way to get to the information they want
before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your
navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase
(http://www.webmasterbase.com)
for example. There is a list
of categories on the left, and information about the network
on the top bar.
It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
bottom of the page because:
- People see the top of the page first
- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation
Â Â Â  gets pushed to bottom of the page... away from the
visitor.
2. Color Scheme
When you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast.
For example, do not use bright green and florescent pink.
Some colors that are often used are white on black or black
on white.
A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color
Schemer (http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/),
created by Aaron Epstein. Many other programs exist that
can assist you in choosing colors. Try doing a search on
FreewareFiles (http://www.freewarefiles.com),
Tucows
(http://www.tucows.com), or Download.com
(http://www.download.com) for
""color schemer.""
3. Content Window
This is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text
here is easy to read and understand.
Also, provide your own original content. People do not want
to hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear
what you want to say! While it might be time consuming to
write your own content, it sure is worth it.
To find content for your website, try searching at
EzineArticles (http://www.ezinearticles.com).
Other people
may have used the articles, but if you become good friends
with the authors, they may send you new content as they
write it. Be careful though. Do not use too much content
from other authors, as mentioned above.
4. Font(s)
Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is
fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.
Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)
Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to
Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can
be used for long pieces of text.
The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,
or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times
(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,
is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because
its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making
it easier to read.
5. Advertising
Ah, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing
that almost every website has. The most common type is
what is known as ""banner"" advertising. It is called that
because it is long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long
you ask? The generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.
New sizes however are being used. Take for example the
new style called ""skyscraper"" -- so called for a reason: it
looks like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not
too wide (about 100-125 pixels.)
Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners
used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the
page.Â  Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in
the middle of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.
Conclusion
These are only five things to consider when designing a
website. There are many others however. Let me know

"review massaro 1998 massaro , d . w . ( 1998 ) . perceiving talking faces : from speech perception to a behavioral principle ( mit press , cambridge , mass . ) . 552 pp . , 212 illus . , 1 cd-rom . $ 55 . 00 . reviewed byl noel nguyen , laboratory for psycholinguistics , fpse , university of geneva , switzerland ( nnguyen @ fapse . unige . ch ) . 1 synopsis 1 . 1 general outline this book is concerned with how multiple sources of information are processed in speech perception and , more generally , in pattern recognition . it is based upon an important research programme conducted by massaro and his colleagues over the last two decades . the book focuses on the perception of so-called bimodal speech , addressing a wide range of issues about the way in which visual information ( as provided by the speaker 's face ) and auditory information are combined with each other by the perceptual system . the scope of the book is much larger , however , as massaro 's purpose here is to describe and defend a new psychological law relevant to a wide variety of domains . in contrast to already well-established laws of the same kind ( e . g . weber 's law of perception ) , which are all unidimensional , the new principle is multidimensional , in that it describes how several factors impact behaviour . this principle is embodied in a computational model of pattern recognition , the fuzzy logical model of perception ( flmp ) , whose latest version is presented and discussed in detail . the flmp is systematically contrasted with alternative computational models , using a broad perceptual database as benchmark throughout the book . in a separate part , the book also deals with methods for synthesizing talking faces in experiments on bimodal speech perception , and introduces baldi , the talking face developed by massaro and his coworkers . the book is accompanied by a cd-rom which contains a series of demonstrations relating to many of the topics dealt with . the book is divided into four main sections . section 1 , "" perceiving talking faces "" , focuses on the perception of speech by ear and eye . massaro reviews the most significant empirical findings in that domain , discusses the main methodological issues , and presents a general classification of the existing computational models of bimodal speech perception . central to this section is the idea that speech perception obeys a general behavioural principle of integration between different sources of information . section 2 , "" broadening the domain "" , aims at assessing how well this principle holds up across broad individual and situational variability . the author demonstrates that inter-individual variations in how bimodal speech is perceived , depending on the listener 's age or native language for instance , can be accounted for within the flmp framework . using examples taken from different perceptual and cognitive situations , massaro also defends the idea that the flmp adequately describes information processing irrespective of these situational differences . section 3 , "" broadening the framework "" , opens with a presentation of an extended and more explicit version of the flmp , designed in particular to account for the dynamics of speech processing . the section also includes a detailed analysis of the methodological issues involved in assessing quantitative predictions in psychology , along with a discussion of the critiques expressed by other investigators about the flmp over the years . finally , section 4 , "" creating talking faces "" , is specifically dedicated to the synthesis of visual speech . 1 . 2 the new behavioural principle although many readers may already be familiar with massaro 's fuzzy logical model of perception , i shall here assume the contrary , and proceed to present a brief outline of the model . a central assumption of the flmp is that pattern recognition involves a common set of processes regardless of the specific nature of the patterns . speech is not seen as being associated with a dedicated processing module , as in the motor theory of speech perception ( liberman , 1996 ) for instance . on the contrary , the sensory information is assumed to be processed in the same way whether our brain is busy recognizing speech sounds , letters , or manual gestures , to take but a few examples . in any of these cases , the flmp postulates that mapping a stimulus into a unique perceptual category entails going through three main stages of processing , the feature evaluation stage , the feature integration stage , and the decision stage . the evaluation stage consists of converting the available sources of information into a set of properties referred to as features . each feature is given a continuous ( fuzzy truth ) value , and represents the degree to which the stimulus corresponds to each of a set of internal prototypical patterns , along a particular perceptual dimension . thus , one important visual feature in the perception of cv syllables is the degree of opening of the lips . the model therefore assumes that the internal prototypes available to the perceptual system will specify that the lips are open at the onset of the syllable for / da / , closed for / ba / , etc . in a second stage , the features are integrated with each other , so as to determine the overall degree of match of the sensory input with each of the prototypes ( e . g . each of the syllables known to the receiver ) . in the third and final stage , a decision is taken , on the basis of the relative goodness of match of the input with each prototype . the flmp makes a number of specific assumptions at each stage in this process . first , it hypothesizes that all of the available sources of information are simultaneously brought into play in pattern recognition . thus , visible speech and auditory speech are both assumed to have an influence on how bimodal speech is perceived . second , different sources of information are assumed to be evaluated independently of each other . this means for example that visible speech does not have any effect on how auditory speech is converted into a set of features , the two sources of information being combined at a later stage of processing only . the model also makes specific assumptions about how sources of information are integrated with each other ( multiplicative rule ) , and about how decisions are taken ( relative goodness rule ) . a major prediction of the model is that "" the influence of one source of information is greatest when the other source is neutral or ambiguous "" ( 19 ) . this prediction is best illustrated by an experiment whose results served as a database for testing models of pattern recognition on several occasions in the book ( chapters 2 and 11 ) . in this experiment , synthetic auditory stimuli ranging on a continuum between / ba / and / da / were crossed with visual stimuli also varying between / ba / and / da / . the bimodal stimuli were presented to subjects in a forced-choice identification task , along with each of the unimodal stimuli . ( this expanded factorial design is shown by massaro to be the most appropriate experimental design for determining how two sources of information are combined with each other in pattern recognition . ) for the bimodal stimuli , the main results are typically depicted as a two-factor plot , with the proportion of / da / responses on the ordinate , the levels of the auditory source of information on the abscissa , and a different curve for each of the levels of the visual source of information . when represented in that way , the results clearly show a statistical interaction between the two sources of information . specifically , the influence of one source of information proves to be larger in the middle , ambiguous range of the other source . this interaction graphically takes the shape of an american football , which is for this reason presented throughout the book as the hallmark of the the fuzzy logical model of perception . in summary , massaro proposes a universal principle of perceptual cognitive performance to explain pattern recognition . according to this principle , "" people are influenced by multiple sources of information in a diverse set of situations . in many cases , these sources of information are ambiguous and any particular source alone does not usually specify the appropriate interpretation . the perceiver appears to evaluate the multiple sources of information in parallel for the degree to which each supports various interpretations , integrate them together to derive the overall support for each interpretation , assess the support of each alternative based on all of the alternatives , and select the most appropriate response . "" ( p . 291 ) . 2 critical evaluation 2 . 1 general evaluation this book is clearly a major contribution to the study of speech perception and , more generally , to cognitive psychology . it is admirably clear and is written in quite an elegant manner . i do not doubt that the book will be read with great interest by research scientists from many different fields . this work is the result of an ambitious intellectual endeavour aimed at introducing a new behavioural law , which is placed by massaro on an equal footing with weber 's law of perception , or the power law of learning . speech scientists are presented with an extensive series of experiments on the perception of bimodal speech . whatever stance they take in that domain , they should find quite challenging massaro 's view that speech perception constitutes but one aspect of a much more general form of cognitive processing , namely pattern recognition . computer scientists working in the field of speech technology should be particularly interested in the book 's final section about the synthesis of visual speech . regardless of their background , readers should also find the book worth using as a tutorial on the experimental methods available for investigating speech perception . a great variety of experimental paradigms and tasks are discussed at length by massaro , who also extensively discusses the methods for assessing computational models of pattern recognition and , in particular , for fitting these models to observed results . in that respect , using the results of the experiment described above as a reference database was quite a good initiative in my view , as this allows the reader more easily to understand massaro 's point as new issues are raised , without having again to go through the details of the experimental design each time . the book should also prove an invaluable resource for teaching . care was taken to select prototypical results , as well as to set this work in its historical context . a number of rather fascinating anecdotes and historical references are given , going from mcgurk 's personal account of the discovery of the mcgurk effect , to an audio-visual rendition of the introduction to george miller 's seminal article on the ubiquitousness of the number 7 plus or minus 2 , with miller 's face texture-mapped onto baldi 's wire-frame head . the cd-rom that accompanies the book enables the reader directly to experience the psychological illusions associated with the perception of bimodal speech , and constitutes as such a most useful research and teaching tool . on the negative side , massaro 's use of the / ba / - / da / experiment as a leading strand throughout obviously results in the book being focused on the perception of non-sense syllables . although the interaction of visible speech and audible speech in word recognition is mentioned on a number of occasions ( e . g . pp 21-23 and pp . 181-182 ) , the book contains few suggestions as to how we perceive isolated words , let alone connected speech . i also was surprised by the fact that little place was devoted to presenting other current theories and models of speech perception . although models such as trace are mentioned on several occasions in the book , i think it is fair to say that the flmp is still given the lion 's share . the book also has some minor defects such as the absence of a list of figures , and the fact that some of the cd-rom bands ( 1 . 4 , 1 . 5 and 1 . 6 ) are referred to incorrectly in the text . the list of the cd-rom selections should have pointed to the pages where each band is referred to . in another domain , it would have been quite interesting to have the perceptual database used in the book made available on the cd-rom . although this would have probably required a substantial amount of additional work , i should also have found it useful to be provided with an interactive version of the main computational models discussed in the book ( flmp , the race model , the single channel model , etc . ) . the flmp model can be downloaded from massaro 's laboratory web site at santa cruz ( http : / / mambo . ucsc . edu ) , but it is currently distributed in fortran code which has to be modified and recompiled for each new set of data , an operation which is probably out of reach of many students in psychology or linguistics . 2 . 2 specific comments i am not familiar with all of the areas dealt with in this book , and will not hide the fact that this review is biased towards my own interests , namely the production and perception of auditory speech . the following comments more specifically concentrate on two issues relating to this area of research , the role of features in speech processing and the time course of speech processing . 2 . 2 . 1 features most useful are the extensive comments made by massaro about the status of features in his model ( see in particular chapter 2 and chapter 10 ) . i long have found it difficult to determine how close these features were to classical phonetic features . the book makes it clear to me that there is no direct relation between the former and the latter . as indicated above , the flmp postulates that there are three main stages of processing in pattern recognition : the feature evaluation stage , the feature integration stage , and the decision stage . specific assumptions are made in the model about how features are integrated with each other , and how a decision is taken depending on the outcome of this integration . from a set of feature values , therefore , the model will predict the probability of occurrence of each possible response ( e . g . "" ba "" and "" da "" ) . however , attention should be paid to the fact that these feature values are in no way derived from the stimulus . they are actually determined in an posteriori manner , from the subjects ' observed responses , using an algorithm ( stepit ) which allows the deviation between these responses and the predicted ones to be minimal . features are seen in the model as * free parameters * , whose values are set on the basis of the actual performance of the subject in the pattern recognition task , so as to make the model perform at its best , i . e . to maximize its goodness of fit . according to massaro , "" [ the model is ] * predicting * the exact * form * of the results , but * postdicting * the actual quantitative * values * that make up the overall predictions "" ( p . 294 , his emphasis ) . in other words , the stimulus is on no occasion explicitly mapped onto the internal features of the flmp model . in that respect , features as defined in the flmp look markedly different from phonetic features . let us take for example the opposition between / ba / and / da / , on which much emphasis is put in the book . acoustically , / b / and / d / are said to differ from each other according to the feature grave-acute , / b / being classified as grave and / d / as acute . as is the case with flmp features , grave and acute can be viewed as target values referring to prototypical stops . however , the grave-acute feature is explicitly defined in acoustical terms ( e . g . slope of the short-term spectrum at the release of the stop , see stevens & blumstein , 1978 ) . on the contrary , the exact nature of the flmp features remains undetermined , their values being subject to one main constraint which is to make the model account for the subjects ' responses as accurately as possible . thus , the acoustic structure of the stimulus is not directly taken into consideration in the estimation of the feature values . in the experiments using audible speech , flmp features do lend themselves to an acoustic interpretation . in the / ba / - / da / experiment for example , the prototypes for / ba / and / da / are assumed to include one auditory feature , namely the variations in frequency of the second ( f2 ) and third ( f3 ) formants at the onset of the vowel ( slightly falling f2-f3 for / da / , rising f2-f3 for / ba / ) . however , this interpretation stems from the fact that f2 and f3 onset frequencies were precisely the acoustic parameters manipulated by the experimenters to synthesize the auditory continuum between / ba / and / da / . in other words , the acoustic significance of the flmp features is derived from the way in which the experiment has been designed . the model does rely on a particular system of acoustic features ( see for example stevens & blumstein , 1978 , for an alternative system ) , but this system is embodied in the experimental design , and is as such external to the model itself . in practice , therefore , the issue of how speech sounds are mapped onto features is not addressed in the model . why this is so is not clear to me . on several occasions , massaro suggests that determining in advance how a given individual will convert a given stimulus into a set of feature values is simply out of our reach . this stimulus-to - feature mapping shows a variability which is said to be analogous to the variability of the weather : there are just too many previous contributions and influences to allow quantitative prediction ( 135 ) . a fundamental distinction is in fact established in the flmp between the intake of * information * , i . e . the stimulus-to - feature mapping , and * information processing * , i . e . how features are combined with each other and mapped into a response ( cf . p . 135 ) . while the flmp predicts that the information will be processed in the same way from one individual to the other , regardless of whether it relates to speech sounds , facial movements , manual gestures , etc . , it is assumed that the way in which this information is extracted from the stimulus is on the contrary subject to too many sources of variations to be accurately characterized ahead of time . in my understanding , this means that the so-called evaluation stage cannot be accounted for by the model , or at least not with much accuracy . however , at least on one occasion massaro does suggest that this limitation is not consubstantial with every model of perception and pattern recognition , and could be circumvented in some way . according to him , one could indeed "" easily hypothesize functions relating the feature values to the stimulus levels , [ although ] that would represent a * model of information * in addition to one of information processing "" ( 294 , my emphasis ) . this suggests that building such a model of information is feasible . whether there is a possibility of the flmp being completed with a model of this kind , i . e . an explicit stimulus-to - feature mapping stage , is an issue which remains to be addressed . 2 . 2 . 2 the time course of speech processing time plays quite a central role in different ways in the book . first , massaro shows how the flmp can be explicitly formalized to account for the dynamics of perceptual processing ( chap . 9 ) . this formalization is presented in reply to criticisms expressed by a number of investigators ( e . g . mcclelland , 1991 ) , who have pointed out that the flmp accurately characterizes the asymptotic outcome of the perceptual system ( e . g . the probability for a particular response to occur ) , but has little to say about the time course of processing . the dynamic version of the flmp is intended to address these reactions . in this version , the stimulus-to - feature mapping is assumed to take a certain amount of time . during this interval , the information about the stimulus gradually accumulates , and becomes increasingly accurate . it is assumed that accuracy increases as a negatively accelerated function of processing time , so that more information is gleaned early than late in the processing of the stimulus . one further assumption is that "" integration of the separate features [ is ] updated continuously as the featural information is being evaluated . similarly , decision [ can ] occur at any time after the stimulus presentation "" ( 259 ) . thus , there is a partial temporal overlap between the different stages of processing , in the sense that one process can begin before a previous process is finished ( see also figure 2 . 1 , p . 41 ) . these assumptions about the time course of information processing are supported by a number of experiments concerned with the effect of backward masking in the recognition of pure tones , and in the recognition of letters . speech obviously raises a number of specific issues in that domain , however . unlike written words , speech is a temporal phenomenon , it is continuous ( i . e . there are no systematic acoustic boundaries between phonemes , syllables , or words ) and , furthermore , time per se serves as a source of information in speech , as pointed out by massaro ( e . g . vowel duration is a major cue to the voicing of the following obstruent , to take but one example ) . somewhat regrettably , few indications are given about how the model could be assessed in the speech domain ( see remarks p . 194 and p . 263 ) . in addition to discussing the dynamics of processing , massaro examines how the temporal relations between sources of information are dealt with in pattern recognition . chapter 3 focuses on our sensitivity to temporal asynchronies between visible and audible speech . in the experiments reported in this chapter , bimodal cv syllables with various degrees of onset asynchrony between the auditory synthetic speech and the visible synthetic speech were presented to subjects in a forced-choice identification task . the results show that integration between the two sources of information still occurs when these sources of information are made asynchronous , provided that the time shift does not exceed a certain duration . one major challenge for phoneticians and psycholinguists alike is to characterize the relationship between what could be called the * external * dynamics of speech , i . e . the temporal organization of the speech signal , and the * internal * time course of speech processing . both play a role in the perception of speech , and it is most difficult to tell apart their respective influences on the listener 's behaviour ( samuel , 1996 ) . for example , in a gating study investigating the role of vowel duration as a cue to the voicing of the post-vocalic stop in cvc syllables , warren and marslen - wilson ( 1988 ) found that the proportion of voiced-coda responses increased as the listeners were presented with increasingly long portions of the initial cv sequence . one obvious interpretation is that longer vowels were perceived as being associated with voiced coda rather than voiceless ones . in keeping with massaro 's dynamical flmp , however , it may also be assumed that evaluating the information provided by the vowel takes time , and that the evidence pointing to a voiced coda gradually accumulates as more processing time is made available to the listener , all other things being equal . thus , the above finding raises the issue of how to differentiate the effect of vowel duration per se on the listener 's response , from that of the internal dynamics of processing . although this issue is not directly addressed in the book , there is no doubt that the flmp would constitute a most appropriate framework for further investigations in this domain . 2 . 3 general conclusion this book provides us with quite an extensive review of the work carried out by the author and others on the use of multiple cues in speech perception and , more generally , pattern recognition . it is aimed at a very large audience , and constitutes a most useful tool both for teaching and research purposes . i do not doubt that it will soon become a major reference for researchers in phonetics , psycholinguistics , and cognitive psychology . 4 bibliography liberman , a . m .

Category of High-Density ATA DrivesMILPITAS, Calif., September 9, 2002-Maxtor Corporation (NYSE: MXO), a worldwide leader in hard disk drives and 
data storage solutions, today announced Maxtor MaXLineTM, its newest 
generation of ATA drives designed specifically for rapidly emerging 
enterprise storage applications including near-line, media storage and 
network storage. The MaXLine family features two critical differentiators: 
huge capacities up to 320 GB for corporate archiving and media recording; 
and unique manufacturing and quality for 24/7 operations with mean time to 
failure (MTTF) rates exceeding one million hours.The MaXLine family is designed to bring hard disk drives into ""near-line"" 
archive applications. By adding a layer of MaXLine drives to archive 
architectures, companies can instantly recover time-critical data including 
executive e-mail, transaction data and accounting data that may need to be 
recovered on demand.These new drives are designed to solve another enterprise problem with the 
storage of video, media and audio conference call files. Even compressed, 
these files take up tremendous amounts of high-cost server space. Priced 
starting around $299.95 to $399.95 MSRP, Maxtor's MaXLine family offers 
high capacity drives for enterprise applications at price points between 
traditional ATA and SCSI drives.For system OEMs and white box builders, MaXLine offers high-density, 
easy-to-integrate storage for use in entry-level and mid-size server 
environments.""The demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies 
are meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e-mails, 
financial documents and transaction records,"" said Mike Dooley, senior 
director of marketing for the Desktop Products Group at Maxtor. ""Users may 
not need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but 
when they do need access, it must be instant. Recent advances in ATA 
technology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our 
legacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ATA 
hard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these 
enterprise applications.""The MaXLine family includes the 5400-RPM MaXLine II, designed for 
capacities up to 320 GB and the 7200-RPM MaXLine Plus II, designed for 
capacities up to 250 GB. At these capacities, MaXLine offers higher storage 
density than many tape and optical solutions. These drives have also been 
tested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements, 
already exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust Maxtor designs, 
which exceed MTTF of over one million hours. These drives will also carry a 
three-year warranty.The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II feature the Maxtor Fast DriveTM 
UltraATA/133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 MB per second. 
The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II will be available with next-generation 
serial ATA interface for higher performance. At 150 MB per second maximum 
data transfer rate, serial ATA improves hard drive performance to keep pace 
with the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive 
environments and enterprise applications.With a point-to-point connection architecture, and rich command set for 
managing hard drive activity and data flow along the interface, serial ATA 
advances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface. 
The interface's reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn 
allows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with 
increased design flexibility and hot plug capability.""Maxtor's MaXLine family of drives provide a solution for storing data that 
has previously been too expensive to keep on disk,"" said Dave Reinsel, 
analyst at IDC. ""The ATA drives offer a great value, low cost per GB and 
when integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling 
cost-effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives, which have 
been the traditional solutions used for near-line applications.""Availability
Limited qualification units of the parallel ATA versions of Maxtor MaXLine 
II and MaXLine Plus II are now available; with volume units available in 
the fourth quarter. Qualification units of the MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus 
II with serial ATA will be available later this month with volume shipments 
scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003.About Maxtor

"I've been testing Razor, invoked from sendmail/procmail and so far it
seems pretty copacetic. Last night's spam to the list provided a good test
- the spam itself as well as several of the responses were flagged, as
other list members reported.This morning I piped the messages out from pine, being careful to use the
RAW mode, to razor-check -d. None of the messages come back as spam, even
the spam. Since folks revoked the false positives, I understand why they
would not come up, but not the spam itself, unless that also was revoked.Is this spam just a bad one to test against, or is there some setting in
pine or razor that I am missing?--

traction is the limiting factor, not motor power. You can basically put
the motors into wheelhubs mounted on a composite frame, and dump juice
into them until they melt, which will be some 100 sec downstream. Plenty
of time to smoke anything.Of course, it doesn't roar, and spew smokage, so it won't happen.

"more details on kern river expansion williams to expand kern river by 124 , 500 dth / d kern river gas transmission , a subsidiary of williams , said it planned on filing an application yesterday with ferc to add 124 , 500 dth / d of additional firm transportation capacity to its 922 - mile pipeline system . the company said the california expansion project will not only provide additional natural gas capacity from wyoming to markets in california , but also will provide an opportunity for williams to offer significantly reduced rates for firm transportation based on the recent approval by ferc of kern river ' s extended term rate program . "" a combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas - fired power generation facilities in california is fueling expansion of the system , "" said kirk morgan , director of business development for kern river and northwest pipeline . the project includes construction of three new compressor stations , an additional compressor at an existing facility in wyoming , restaging a compressor in utah , and upgrading two meter stations . kern river said the $ 80 million project is targeted to be complete by may 1 , 2002 . the company said demand for firm transportation on kern river was driven by several factors : the diversion of canadian gas supplies to markets in the midwest from the pacific region ; increased production in the rocky mountain basin ; strong economic growth in kern river ' s market areas ; and increased demand from gas - fired electric generation facilities . williams said it anticipates holding an open season later this year to determine the level of market interest in a second expansion of the kern river pipeline . "" the demand for competitively priced transportation to markets in nevada and california continues to grow . at the same time , gas producers in the rocky mountain basin are stepping up production . an expansion on kern river in 2003 could help bring that production to market , "" said morgan .",Safe Email

Jobs touts OS X, iPods, iMacNEW YORK--Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs on Wednesday defended the company's switch to the Mac OS X operating system and unveiled new iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.
Jobs used his keynote speech at the Macworld trade show here to make a flurry of other announcements as well, such as details about new syncing software, the next update to OS X and the end of free iTools.The most dramatic announcement focused on iPod. The new players include ones built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system.July 17, 2002, 8:30 AM PT
 | Read Full Story Scient files for Chapter 11 Internet consulting firm Scient has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and agreed to sell certain assets to a professional services firm.
The deal calls for Salt Lake City-based SBI to hire some of Scient's employees and to provide up to $4.9 million in financing, pending completion of the asset acquisition.Scient has been struggling for some time now. Once a dot-com darling, the company recently approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split.
The company and SBI said they expect the bankruptcy court to approve the deal, adding that financing ""will allow Scient to continue to deliver services to its clients without interruption until court approval of SBI's acquisition is received.""

 | Read Full Story Yahoo Mail puts words in your mouthWhat does Yahoo Mail have against mocha?
That's what users of the company's free e-mail service may be wondering if they try to send a message using the word ""mocha"" and discover that while in transit, ""mocha"" mysteriously changes to ""espresso.""To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as ""mocha"" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.
The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contain JavaScript instructions that can run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example.

 | Read Full Story New chip may portend ATI comebackATI, once the leader in graphics chips, will launch its comeback bid this week with a new chip that experts say could put the company back in front in terms of performance.
The Markham, Ontario-based company on Thursday will unveil the details of the Radeon 9700, a desktop graphics chip based on a new architecture that will provide greater realism when it comes to 3D images, according to sources.The fastest versions of the new chips will offer considerably higher performance than Nvidia's current GeForce4 roster, giving ATI the edge with gamers as well as PC makers, analysts said. And even after Nvidia--which began to chip away at ATI's leading spot in graphics in 1999--comes out with its GeForce 5 in a few months, the competition between the two will remain close.

INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
EVENT
Â Exhibitions India
organises the Convergence 
India Â exhibition & conference, which is the
longest running 
international trade-show and the only forum in India
to showcase the 
convergence of voice and data networks, delivery of content,

Â 
Exhibitions India invites
you to participate 
at theÂ 11th Convergence India 2003 exhibition
& 
conference, which will be at Pragati Maidan,
New Delhi, 
India duringÂ 11-13 March
2003.
Â 
The 
Government of India has recently mandated the Conditional
Access System for 
distribution of satellite television channels. This has
created a whole new 
marketplace in the Indian cable industry. Once this bill is
made an act, it will 
be mandatory for cable operators to distribute pay channels
through a set-top 
box.India has an estimated 38
million cable homes! The 
implementation of this change will require massive
investments in set-top boxes, 
conditional access software and the upgradation of headend
networks - a great 
oppotunity for you to tap this huge market!! Exhibiting your
products at the 
11th Convergence India exhibition will give you an
opportunity to meet 
all yourÂ  targetted visitors under a
single 
roof.Other
exhibits will be from 
various industries including high speed networking, internet
telephony, mobile 
and satellite communications, network infrastructure, optical
access networking, 
portable communication devices, t&m and interactive
media, VoIP, wireless 
access, 3G, m-commerce, multimedia broadband services via
satellite, conditional 
access technologies, satellite receivers and transmitters,
encoders, decoders, 
and the latest in broadcast, cable and satellite
equipment,Â mobile phone 
accesoriesÂ  etc.We 
successfully concluded the 10th Convergence
India 2002 
exhibition and conference at New Delhi - the event
hadÂ 176 exhibitors from 
17Â countries displaying their equipment and technologies
to a discerning 
audience ofÂ 16,093 visitors from the industry,
government, related trade 
associations. The event got extensive coverage from

"summary of ' bubbler ' a few months ago i posted an inquiry on the linguist listing on the distribution of the word "" bubbler "" as a synonym for drinking fountain . thanks to all who responded , which are too many to list . the dictionary of american regional english has also extensively investigated this word and it was my goal to gain more specific information than that supplied by dare ( for example , the regional distribution within wisconsin . ) here is a summary of my findings : in wisconsin , bubbler is used throughout the eastern half of the state , particularly along the coast of lake michigan and becomes less prominent the further west one travels . the "" stronghold "" of bubbler appears to be in milwaukee and its suburbs . milwaukee is also thought to be the geographic origin of bubbler , coined by the kohler company in the early 1900 's . my university ( uw - whitewater ) appears to be in conflict over what to call drinking fountains . in one of our residence halls there is a sign asking residents to not use the drinking fountain as a garbage disposal . the word 'd rinking ' is crossed out , and ' water ' is put in its place . then ' water ' and ' fountain ' are crossed out , and ' bubbler ' is put in their place . it goes to show you that people can be very loyal to their colloquialisms ! my research provided no evidence for the term 's use in minnesota or illinois , but i did find the word in use along the western part of michigan 's upper peninsula ( which borders wisconsin 's bubbler-using region . ) if bubbler is used anywhere else in the midwest , its existence escaped my research . in fact , i found no evidence of the word 's use within the u . s . west of the mississippi or south of the ohio river . the other region that uses the term includes the state of rhode island ( where it is used exclusively by many speakers ) , far eastern connecticut , and southeastern massachusetts - including the boston area . i had people from this region respond with amusement because they did n't know the word was used anywhere outside of their area . lastly , and much to my surprise , bubbler is used in southeastern australia - predominately in new south wales ( including sydney and canberra ) and in portions of the provinces bordering new south wales . the information on australia is only based on a few responses , but there were some , especially in sydney , who used bubbler exclusively while growing up . there were some from parts of australia who had never heard the term before , so it does appear that it is also regionally distributed in australia . there were some who distinguished bubblers from drinking fountains . some only called outside fountains , bubblers , while others vice versa . one only called non-refridgerating fountains , bubblers . drinking fountain seems to be the generic term that everyone is familiar with , whether they use it or not . other synonymns are : water fountain , water cooler , fountain , and water bubbler . for what its worth , the only accounts i had of the term ' water bubbler ' were among african americans from milwaukee ( but this only included three people . ) just plain ' fountain ' seemed to be the word of choice in northwestern wisconsin , while drinking fountain and water fountain were used pretty interchangeably everywhere else . as for its use in literature , the only printed documentation of bubbler i could find ( under the given definition ) was a 1985 milwaukee journal article which was about the word 's usage in milwaukee . i realize that some of my findings are inconsistent with dare - i believe this is because my research was not nearly as thorough as dare , and did n't take into account historical usage , only current usage . thanks again to those who responded . your avid bubbler user , sean christensen internet : seanc @ iclnet93 . iclnet . org university of wisconsin - whitewater",Safe Email

using them for ages. I think Mandrake also makes these kind of empty
packages.Anyway, their use has been discussed here a while back, and personally
although I do agree that they can be useful at times, I don't really like
them. For me it's more of an ugly ""hack"" than anything else, and I'd
approve completely a system that would enable to install/remove entire
categories of software... but not if achieved by building empty packages.Also, you can trivially do ""apt-get install "", but removing
all that it installed is a bit less trivial, and could be implemented in a
trivial and clean fashion if using some functionality meant to do this.Matthias--

"LOL!  They're not doomed at all.  Thousands of men wear cb2000s to work 
every day (along with other chastity devices).    They are not just 
decorations.  You will not get a woody or have an orgasm until your 
keyholder allows you to.  Anyhow, I know better than to have this 
type of conversation with a 'nilla, but these men wear these happily, and 
consensually.  (:  There is little power struggle in the lifestyles of the 
people who use these.  There is power exchange instead.  Lots of 
variations on the definition, but this one's from Gloria Brame's site:Power exchange: the consensual transfer of power by the submissive to the 
dominant. The exchange takes place when the returned energy from the 
dominant empowers the submissive. Anyhow, there are tons of informative sites out there for anyone who cares 
to read them, but I assure you, the chastity device business is doing very 
well, and it is illegal to force someone to wear one.  It's not coercion, 
it is creative sensuality.  (:

"Hello,Has anyone made a working source RPM for dvd::rip for Red Hat 8.0?
Matthias has a spec file on the site for 0.46, and there are a couple of
spec files lying around on the dvd::rip website, including one I patched
a while ago, but it appears that the Makefile automatically generated is
trying to install the Perl libraries into the system's, and also at the
moment dvd::rip needs to be called with PERLIO=stdio as it seems to not
work with PerlIO on RH8's Perl.Not too sure what the cleanest way to fix this is - anyone working on
this?Thanks,--

"just released ! 10 million ! ! ! it was just released ! ! introducing . . . millions vol . 1a we took a total of over 92 million email addresses from many of the touted cd 's that are out there ( bought them all - some were $ 300 + ) ! we added the millions we had in storage to those . when we combined them all , we had in excess of 100 + million addresses in one huge file . we then ran a super "" sort / de-dupe "" program against this huge list . it cut the file down to less than 25 million ! ! ! can you believe that ? it seems that most people that are selling cd 's are duping the public by putting numerous files of addresses in the cd over and over . this created many duplicate addresses . they also had many program "" generated "" email addresses like compuserve , mci , anon 's , etc . this causes a tremendous amount of undeliverables , and for those that use stealth programs , clogs up servers quickly with trash , etc . we then ran a program that contained 1800 + keywords to remove addresses with vulgarity , profanity , sex-related names , postmaster , webmaster , flamer , abuse , spam , etc . , etc . also eliminated all . edu , . mil , . org , . gov , etc . after that list was run against the remaining list , it reduced it down to near 10 million addresses ! so , you see , our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all others that are out there on cd and otherwise . using ours will be like using the 100 + million that we started with , but a lot less money and alot less time ! ! we also purchased cyber - promos ( $ 995 . 00 ) cd . we received it just prior to finishing production work on the new cd . we had our people take a random sample of 300 , 000 addresses from the touted 2 . 9 that they advertised . we used a program that allows us to take a random sample of addresses from any list . we were able to have the program take every 9th address , thus giving us a 300 , 000 list of cyber 's email addresses from top to bottom . we cleaned these , and came up with about 100 , 000 addresses . these are also mixed in . we also included a 6 + million "" remove / flamer "" file broke into seperate files for ease of extracting and adding to your own database of removes .

"20th July, 2002To:    The PresidentFrom:  AB SanniAssalam Aleikum,I wish to seek your assistance in a matter that needs trust secrecy and
confidentiality.I am A. B. Sanni, a close confidant to Mohammed Abacha, son of late
General Sani Abacha, former head of state Federal Republic of Nigeria, who
ruled from November 17th 1993 to June 8th 1998 when he died suddenly in
office.Since then, the family as a whole has been facing all sorts of
harassments, by security operatives/agents of the new Head of State
(General Obasanjo) who served a jail term under my friend's father for
coup offence. Even my friend's old mother has been detained and tortured
many times.  Mohammed is now being charged for military decision of his
father's regime e.g. the murder cases of political opponents. These
offences he knows nothing about, as he was only the Head of State's son,
not even a military man nor was he in the government. His father ruled for five years during which period he acquired financial
gains and property all over the world from his share of Crude Oil Sales as
the Head of State. Now, the family has lost all assets (property and money
in Nigeria) to the new government. Ref. News Watch Magazine publication of
11th to 18th October, 1999. However, they have hidden records in a secret
name with the Nigerian Insurance Deposit Corporation to access a coded
trust accounts in Europe valued at Three Hundred and Thirty Eight Million
United States Dollars only ($338,000,000).   Mohammed is currently being
detained and tortured to sign off accounts of his late father and he has
done that but not the coded trust accounts in the name of certain
government multinational contractors that I can not disclose now.THE AIM OF THIS LETTER IS TO REQUEST YOUR ASSISTANCE TO SECURE THIS
ACCOUNT IN A SAFE/CONFIDENTIAL BANK AND HELP INVEST THE MONEY FOR OUR
MUTUAL BENEFIT. We also expect to use some of our share of the money to
relocate ourselves to another safe Country because right now Nigeria is
not safe and we will like to go into hiding overseas if we can escape.If you are interested in helping secure the accounts please contact me
immediately by email ""a_sanni@email.com"", so that we can arrange an
initial meeting in a neighboring country, thus you can present your
investment program and projects for our assessment.  Thereafter we will
sign an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) binding this business
relationship and immediately entrust you to access the coded trust
accounts in Europe valued at Three Hundred and Thirty Eight Million United
States Dollars only ($338,000,000).We will depend on your business experience to make sure that we get
maximum returns on our investment with you.PLEASE NOTE THAT IN THE PROCESS OF SECURING THE CODED TRUST ACCOUNT YOU
ARE LIKELY TO INCURE EXPENSES BUT IT WILL BE PAID BACK ONCE WE SECURE THE
DEPOSIT.  IT IS 100% SAFE FOR YOU AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. 
Just forward via email your full name, phone number, fax number and bank
details as the new beneficiary to enable us make formal application for
the transfer of ownership to you.We look forward to your helping us, but if you are not interested kindly
discard this letter and still maintain its confidentiality.Ma-Salam.For Mohammed Abacha",Phishing Email

"hpl other alternatives here are a few alternatives to handling lal echterhoff ' s situation : ( 1 ) we give cash difference in black - scholes value between one year and three year options calculated as of the termination date of 5 / 31 / 01 . the analysis isn ' t very pretty : the total difference for all affected shares ( 165 , 000 ) is only $ 1652 . these options are so far in the money that the time value is de minimus .

"On Fri, Jul 26, 2002 at 03:56:22PM +0100 or so it is rumoured hereabouts, 
Wynne, Conor thought:

> All you car about are the confs as the boite has no DATA right?
 
Yeah, but then I'd have to remember _exactly_ which confs I'd modified and
they're not all in /etc either...> Thats what I would do, but you sysadmins have to make life as difficult &
> complicated as possible ;--)Yup...  In this case, I had two issues.  1. I mirrored the disk to give to
someone else to work on but the box he has available has only a P1 or P2
processor.  2. My celeron box has been crashing the backup software so I
wanted to try out the backup in a different box to make sure it's hardware
related.  Again, it's also an interesting exercise...
 
> Have you thought about mirroring the system drives? Might save you serious
> hassle down the line. Oh, I'm doing that too.  This is going to Africa so I'm aiming for as
robust as possible with belt, braces and probably an all-in-one jumpsuit!
I'll be mirroring the disk but that is worth only so much (eg. lightning
strike taking out the disk(s) or system compromise)  I'm also going for a
backup to CDR with an automated restore http://www.mondorescue.org .  The
admin out there wouldn't be able to build the system again if the mobo got
fried and the replacement was the wrong arch but an i386 compatible
install will mean just dropping in the HD and booting (ish)...Conor

( dutch , english , first price - sealed bid , and second - price sealed bid . ) in fact , the selling price is equal to the valuation of the second highest bidder . for example , in vickrey auction , everyone bids at his own valuation . hence , the winner pays the valuation of the second highest bidder . in english auction , the second highest valuation bidder will stop competing if the price is above his valuation . hence , the winner also gets the item at the price of the second highest valuation bidder . thank you for attending the meeting and giving many helpful contributions . - chonawee",Safe Email

"Ananova:Â  
Newspaper's readers complain over 'let's have sex' picture captionReaders of an African newspaper have complained after a picture caption
about jewellery contained the words ""let's have sex"".
The mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languages
spoken in Namibia.
Callers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, which
translates roughly as ""let's have intercourse"" in the Oshiwambo language.
It was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings from
the femidon - female condom - as jewellery.
According to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIV
patients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist.
He intended it to mean ""you will see for yourselves"" in the Siyeyi tongue.
One caller said the complainants ""should be considerate of other people's
languages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...And
that the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo"".
Others indicated that various words might have different meanings in various
Namibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which in
Siyeyi means testicles.
Another word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambo
translates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's have
intercourse.
The Herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an Oshiwambo word for a vagina.

* Judge Grants Consumer Voice in ReplayTV Lawsuit  Hollywood Tries to Skip Over Consumers' ConcernsLos Angeles - Judge Florence Cooper today granted five ReplayTV owners
a voice in the court debate over their rights to record television
programs and to skip commercials using digital video recorders (DVRs).
The federal court denied the entertainment industry motion to dismiss
the ReplayTV owners' lawsuit and agreed to combine the consumer
lawsuit with an entertainment industry lawsuit filed last fall to ban
ReplayTV DVRs.""We're pleased the court has recognized that the debate about digital
video recorders must include the customers who purchase and use the
devices,"" said Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Intellectual
Property Attorney Robin Gross.""[T]he issue of whether the Newmark Plaintiffs' use of the ReplayTV
DVRs' send-show and commercial-skipping features constitutes fair use
will most likely figure prominently in both the ReplayTV action and
the Newmark action,"" wrote Judge Cooper in her opinion.Responding to the entertainment industry's lawsuit against DVR
manufacturers, EFF petitioned the court on behalf of the five ReplayTV
owners to declare legal their use of the digital devices also known as
personal video recorders (PVRs). EFF seeks to ensure that the legal
debate over DVRs will include consumers' concerns along with those of
the entertainment and consumer electronics industries.The entertainment industry claims that commercial skipping infringes
copyright and digital recording aids piracy.""I'm not a crook if I skip commercials or share a news interview of
myself with my mom using the SendShow feature rather than sending her
a videotape,"" said Craig Newmark, founder of craigslist.org and a
ReplayTV owner. ""I shouldn't have to worry about getting prosecuted,
but the Turner Broadcasting CEO tells us that taking a bathroom break
is criminal. We even have Senators urging Attorney General Ashcroft to
prosecute people who share files.""Along with Newmark, ReplayTV customers filing the lawsuit with legal
representation by the EFF are: Keith Ogden, owner of a financial
broker firm in San Francisco; Shawn Hughes, a small business owner in
Georgia; Seattle journalist Glenn Fleishman; and southern Californian
video engineer Phil Wright.Links:For this release:

* Musician Disputes Industry's Stance on Music Sharing  Janis Ian Urges Artists Speak Out, Support Free DownloadsSan Francisco - Grammy-winning songwriter and recording artist Janis
Ian today challenged the music industry by celebrating peer-to-peer
(P2P) music sharing as a boon to musicians.Ian, who is in the San Francisco Bay Area as part of her current
concert tour, recently published ""The Internet Debacle,"" a pointed
critique of the music industry's disregard for musicians and consumers
who want to distribute and acquire music online. The Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF) applauds Ian's actions and hopes that others
will see the Internet as an aid, not a threat, to musicians.In the article, Ian assails the major record labels' argument that P2P
file-sharing is harming artists.""Free Internet downloads are good for the music industry and its
artists,"" explains Ian. ""Every act that can't get signed to a major,
for whatever reason, can reach literally millions of new listeners,
enticing them to buy the CD and come to the concerts.""She adds that during the heyday of Napster she saw a marked increase
in CD sales from her website. She attacks technological and political
measures meant to harm consumers by restricting their right to copy
and back up their legally purchased music.Ian will play on August 17 in San Rafael, CA.During her 17 album career, Ian has earned nine Grammy nominations and
three awards. Her best known songs include 1967's ""Society's Child""
and 1975's ""At Seventeen."" More recently, her 1993 album ""Breaking
Silence"" was nominated for a Grammy Award as Contemporary Folk Album
of the Year. Her songs have been recorded by artists ranging from
Bette Midler to Cher, from Glen Campbell to Vanilla Fudge, and from
Joan Baez to Etta James.

* Court Hearing Set in DeCSS Publication Jurisdiction CaseOn September 5, 2002, the California Supreme Court will hear oral
arguments about whether a California court has jurisdiction over
Matthew Pavlovich, an Indiana college student who is a resident of
Texas, for his hosting of an Internet mailing list. Pavlovich
maintained the mailing list for the LiVid programming group, which
provides a unified development and user resource center for video and
DVD-related work for the Linux operating system. One of the group's
projects was to create a DVD player for computer systems that run
Linux. As part of that effort, DeCSS, a program that decrypts the copy
protection on DVDs, was published on the group's mailing list. The
entertainment industry has sued Pavlovich in California court, and
last year a California appellate court ruled Pavlovich was within the
state court's jurisdiction since he published information that relates
to the entertainment industry, which is based in California.EFF and Pavlovich's legal team argue that Pavlovich is outside of
California's jurisdiction since he was a college student in Indiana
with no contacts to California when DeCSS was published on the LiVid
list. The hearing on September 5 will take place in San Francisco.

"the "" hacek "" "" hacek "" is the diminutive of the czech word "" hak "" , meaning hook . if i ' m not mistaken , a lot of czechs attribute the innovation to the religious and linguistic reformer jan hus ( 1369 ? - 1415 ) . my sources , however , have him introducing a dot over the letters to indicate palatalization rather than a hacek . one of my czech pedagogical grammars claims haceks were appearing in czech manuscripts in the late 13th century , while another explains that the language 's diacritical conventions stabilized around the end of the 16th century , and that publications of the church of the czech brethren used haceks rather than hus 's dots . any of those who introduced the hacek could , in my uneducated opinion , have seen haceks in hebrew manuscripts like those described in alice faber 's recent posting , but we do n't know that . by the way , i ' ve recently seen haceks used in phonological renderings of swiss german in journals from berne dating around 1920 ( "" beitraege zur schweizerdeutschen grammatik "" ) . last year i also saw in the czech press one or two essays by czech jounalists stationed overseas who complained about the peculiarity of haceks ( e . g . , they ' re not found on most international typewriter keyboards ) and how it would make their lives easier if the czechs would adopt some more "" ordinary "" way of rendering the sounds in question . i very much doubt , however , that their opinion is much shared by their colleagues and compatriots . james kirchner",Safe Email

"wall street ' s dirty little secret . . . it was the spring of 1979 . i was just a tall , goofy looking kid in middle school with buck - teeth and freckles . each day in the cafeteria , i walked from table to table . . . stealing other kids ' lunch money . no , i didn ' t rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made them a little deal . "" let me borrow two dollars today , "" i said , "" and i ' ll bring you five dollars next week . "" the investment was too good to pass up , and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes . of course when "" next week "" rolled around and i couldn ' t pony up the cash , i promised to pay them even more the week after that , if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer . eventually the end of the year came and went , high school started and with it came girls , and homework , and parties , and sports , and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year ' s lunch money . i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid , and i didn ' t even get beat up . hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn . first of all , greed is your number one enemy . you ' re not going to turn $ 2 into $ 5 in a week , so cash out when you ' re ahead . don ' t wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket . second , never trust an investment adviser of any kind . they are looking out for their own money , not yours . the "" professionals "" , those stuffy investment counselors and money managers , will always tell you that the best time to buy is now . according to those guys , the longer you keep your money in the market , the more money you ' re going to make . ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is "" never "" . in a sense , they are right . if you put $ 250 , 000 in an index fund right now , you ' ll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years . but here ' s the problem : do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich ? hell no ! you want the money now - so you can enjoy it . it ' s hard to make use of your fortune when you ' re seventy years old in a wheelchair . if you could make a million dollars in the next few years , what would you do with it ? where would you travel ? what kind of car would you buy ? the fact is . . . youth is the best time to be rich . if your goal is to make quick profits in the market , volatility is your ally , and stability your enemy . you want to see those large upswings , two hundred points in a day , followed by the four hundred point crash a week later . you don ' t care if the market went up or down 20 % this year as long it was unstable . that ' s how you ' re going to make the money . what i ' m talking about here is day trading . my father invests the traditional way ; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k . in the long term of 5 - 10 years he makes money . the day trader buys or sells 5 , 000 shares of xyz for a $ 25 , 000 profit in a 5 - 10 minute trade . he acts quickly , taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock , and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours , sometimes within minutes . i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it . it ' s not rocket science , and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started . society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training . the truth is , wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money . popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring . they don ' t want the competetion - and they sure as hell don ' t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they ' d charge you forty or fifty dollars . they make their money only if you believe two lies : 1 ) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average person . 2 ) that using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade . here is what the financial gurus in today ' s society absolutely , positively do not want you to know . . . the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying . after reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade , and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market , i ' ve learned the following lessons : * * achieving financial success is incredibly simple . * * anyone can do it . * * it only takes a few hours to learn . when i discovered the secret to day trading , i didn ' t become wealthy overnight . if you want instant cash , drive to wal - mart . buy a ski mask and a shotgun , and rob your local bank . the only way to get rich , quick or otherwise , is through hard work , knowledge , and determination . after learning the fundamentals of day trading , i started practicing the trading art itself , and the first few weeks brought modest gains . the next few months gave me the practical experience i needed to really earn a living , and i was pulling close to a six figure income . in less than three years with no formal financial training , minimal effort and only moderate risk , i had made my first million . the knowledge that i gained during those formative trading years i am willing to share with you in my new book , the master trader . you will learn from my mistakes , and from my successes , as i teach you the simple , secret formula for day trading that i ' ve used profitably year after year . the income of the day trader can be staggering . thousands , even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes . the difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this : knowledge . i will provide that knowledge , and i will give you a winning edge at this high - stakes game . average income of a day trader : 5 % average an income in excess of $ 500 , 000 per year 22 % average an income in excess of $ 250 , 000 per year 35 % average an income in excess of $ 100 , 000 per year . 27 % average an income between $ 50 , 000 and $ 99 , 999 per year 11 % average an income between $ 20 , 000 and $ 49 , 999 per year after reading the master trader , you will discover extremely profitable , simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win despite the current market weakness . here is just a snippet of what i will teach you : * * * make money whether a stock goes up or down . * * * learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds . * * * learn exactly what stocks to trade , the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them . * * * save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the mistakes beginners make . * * * learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money consistently in every market ! * * * learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance for great success . * * * profit on huge intraday price swings . * * * make money on the biggest news stories . * * * actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum returns . * * * learn how to use the tools and information wall street professionals use . * * * learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind . it ' s time to ask yourself : "" am i going to listen to the professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell ? or am i going to take control of my own financial future , and start making money right now in the stock market ? "" who is looking out for your best economic interests - some wealthy wall street stockbroker , or yourself ? with the master trader e - book , you will learn everything you need to know in order to get started with day trading . . . from choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional trading strategies that make professional traders millions of dollars . the master trader e - book is the most comprehensive yet easy to understand and straight - forward book ever written about active trading . if you are serious about success in short term stock trading - order today and start paving the road to your own financial future . oh , and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade ? his high school friends laughed when he said he was going to make money in the stock market . six years later , he bought a beach - front home on the california coast - with cash . oops , they weren ' t laughing anymore . in a rollercoaster market like we have today , day trading is the fastest track to wealth . if you ' re looking for a long - term retirement investment with no risk that goes up 5 % a year , then by all means , this ain ' t your kind of game . but if you want the quickest possible way to make a fortune in the market , with the lowest element of risk , then order the master trader e - book right now . i promise to teach you all of the secrets that helped me become a millionaire through successful day trading . you don ' t need to know anything about the market , and anyone can do it , with minimum effort . it ' s an easy game to win if you know how the pieces move . order the master trader e - book right now for only $ 49 . 97 by clicking on the link below : http : / / 4 tools 4 life . com / qs our company is strictly opposed to unsolicited emails . to be removed from this list , please send an email to "" bulkexpert @ yahoo . com """,Phishing Email

"re : sapir - whorf and what to tell students these days here 's what i tell my undergrad and grad students about that same chapter in language files . i . e . , it 's difficult to even judge what 's going on with whorf unless you are simultaneously conversant with linguistics , american indian languages , and at least the insights of modern physics . first , the conclusion that is appropriate is that , as i showed in "" the demise of the whorf hypothesis "" ( berkeley linguistics society , 1978 ? ) , what whorf said has little or generally no relation whatever to the entire body of discussion that comes under the name "" ( sapir - ) whorf hypothesis "" . he showed decades before the critics came up with their own hypotheses , which they failed to name after themselves , that he would never have agreed with their characterization of his thoughts . simple test : read the lf chapter and then ask , "" who created the whorf hypothesis ? "" and a quick way to answer this is : what did whorf himself call it in his two or three references ? he called it the "" principle of linguistic relativity "" or the "" linguistic relativity principle "" . my own reading of whorf never finds the word "" hypothesis "" at all . so - - right off the bat , and this is a good way to teach scientific nomenclature , who turned whorf 's ' principle ' into a ( n ) ' hypothesis ' , and why ? it was n't whorf , because his designation was clear . so what is the difference between the two ? well , a principle is like an axiom in geometry : a starting point which is theoretically unverifiable - - it 's just a starting point . you want something else , you begin from a different starting point , and then you develop your hypotheses from there . next : what does whorf 's "" linguistic relativity principle "" have to do , if anything , with einstein 's "" relativity principle "" ( which i covered in my also bls , 1980 ? , paper , "" is whorf 's relativity einstein 's relativity ? "" ) . ah , now we ' ve gotten to the crux of it - - much against pinker 's stand ( which was copied and intensified in a lingua franca short bio of suzette elgin hayden recently , where a digression found its author saying that whorf cobbled together his theory from a few ill-translated snatches of apache - - echoing a pinker statement and relying on pinker 's quoting whorf correctly , which he did n't , about a canoe on a beach pointwise : which pinker identified as an apache sentence , but which whorf knew quite well was nootka in the pacific northwest rather than apache in the beachless desert ) , whorf was upping the ante on einstein , who argued that euclidian geometry , far from being universal , was applicable only to flat surfaces ; that for round surfaces , which most of reality is made up of , you need non - euclidian geometry . i . e . , when the phenomena change significantly , you have to change the tool you ' re using . well , that 's what whorf said too ( see heisenberg 's lament below ) , except he moved its domain from mathematics to natural human language ; hence : the truly aptly named "" principle of linguistic relativity "" as whorf himself named it . admittedly , this does n't make any sense until you see it in action , in "" an american indian model of the universe , "" where he posits a worldview without our tense / time ( past / present / future diorama or river of time ) , using manifested / manifesting ( plus other synonyms ) instead . that is : sae grammars / cultures give that aforementioned notion of "" time "" , which is supported and maintained by their tense systems ( though , admittedly , english is weird and gets it through the culture side of the language / culture system ) ; the hopi language / culture system has no such image of time , working from a different worldview principle that sees only cyclical , not linear , time - - round , not flat . most of the world 's grammars that have broken out of the latinate mold show that the particular time / tense system of sae is pretty much peculiar to western european languages - - hence a linguistic / cultural ontology of "" time "" as we know and practice it , and not the supposed universal we have so fondly believed it to be . side note : for one who reads whorf closely , he makes five or ten times more universalist statements than relativity statements in his writings , yet he is seen ( and reviled in a chomskyan universalist attitude ) as the relativist par excellent . so right from the get-go we see that 1 ) whorf did n't write and would n't agree with the hypothesis that someone ( s ) named after him ; 2 ) rather than being some deranged crackpot , he was merely literate : whorf was one of the few interdisciplinary thinkers between physics and linguistics in this century ; 3 ) whorf 's relativity principle had something important to do with einstein 's ; and 4 ) whorf was a universalist as well as a relativist - - he just had them in balance , a notable enough rarity in current academe , you must admit . if i may be so bold , alluding to your posting that "" no one has disproved whorf 's mild version of linguistic relativity ( let 's leave ling . determinism aside , or the stronger version . ) "" , even the mild version was n't his ! trace back like i did and you will find that whorf espoused neither strong nor weak versions of determinism , and relativity has nothing to do with determinism when you see it from the physics viewpoint above , as he did . if you read carefully , writers about the whorf hypothesis admit that even whorf did n't hold a strong version of determinism ( so if he did n't , who did ? and if nobody did , why bring it up ? ) , and that all the critics hold the weak version that they dreamed up ( even though whorf would n't hold it because it 's at least weakly deterministic and therefore newtonian ) . so what 's going on ? the problem is that whorf had already , from his acquaintance with physics , moved from newtonian monocausal determinism as an ideal into systems thinking - - where sometimes the opposite of one profound truth is another profound truth , where everything is interdependent , multicausal , interconnected : language shapes culture while culture is shaping language ; language shapes thinking while thinking is shaping language . the cumulative effect of the ( humboldt / boas / sapir - ) whorf hypothesis literature has been primarily to throw up a smokescreen around his ideas so that people , including grad students in linguistics , psychology , anthropology and sociology , won't read him in the original ( english ! ) . i tell my grad students that if they want to really find out what their discipline is about , go find out who their discipline is beating up on and read them ; and if you are so lucky as me to find someone that four major academic disciplines are ganging up on - - you know you ' ve hit a goldmine ! what in the world could be so important that four academic disciplines create a combined smokescreen ? because so few linguists in this century have availed themselves of the changes in thinking about reality that physics has been broadcasting during this entire century , few linguists are even qualified to step into what they did n't realize was an interdisciplinary debate in the history of ideas which whorf felt so comfortable in . i ' ll explain . i ' ll give you a synopsis of a talk i intend to give at a 100th birthday conference for benjamin whorf , which i intend to get funding for and hold in the bay area in spring 1997 . i call it "" heisenberg 's lament . "" you see , early in this century , that ' uncertain ' heisenberg was among the first to gain a ' glimpse ' into the subatomic world ; and , having done so , he rendered his opinion that , regarding the subatomic realm , "" we have reached the limits of our language . "" he said this for two reasons : 1 ) no matter how glibly western scientists talk about electrons , protons , neutrons , quarks , etc . , when we look into that realm there are no ' things ' , only processes and relationships ; but in order to make sense ( i . e . , complete sentences ) in sae languages , we need nouns - - and there 's nothing in the subatomic realm that you can , except willy-nilly , attach nouns to . and 2 ) given that , our most fundamental scientific terms such as "" same "" and "" different "" are useless . he did n't know then , and physics does n't know now , whether there are gazillions of electrons or just one electron with gazillions of manifestations . we have reached the limits of our language . fast - forward a few decades and whorf hears this in his physics classes at yale ( he has unpublished manuscripts on gravity in the yale archives ) , and ponders : hm , i wonder if this has anything to do with what prof . sapir said the other day about hopi not needing nouns to express ordinary propositions - - just "" rehpi "" , "" flashed "" , instead of "" it "" or "" the / a light flashed "" : because when you come right down to it , how is the flashing different from the light ? is "" light "" just a convenient grammatical fiction foisted upon us by sae grammar ? and as he pondered ' light ' being noun or verb , particle or wave , depending on how it 's viewed , he saw the universe in the same way , with different cultures taking different positions on the question . in this case , since hopi did n't seem to take too seriously the absence of nouns , perhaps , whorf surmised , hopi could be of use for physicists in exploring and reporting back about the quantum world , that realm that did n't have thingy nouns . fast - forward another few decades and physicist david bohm reads whorf ( which i confirmed personally in talking to him ) , and then , * in response * ( my attribution ) , writes _ wholeness and the implicate order _ , in which he , among other things , tries to make english more verby and performative in the "" rheomode "" - - a brilliant flop ; and then launches on the scientific community a view of the universe which does not contain our familiar notions of past / present / future time , but instead an implicate and explicate order of reality - - an "" inny / outty "" notion where the future is inside us working outward instead of some vague distant goal we are headed toward . an email acquaintance pointedly asked me what the difference was between bohm 's terminology and whorf 's terminology ; it took me 6 months to finally answer that there was none , except the hopis had had theirs for millennia longer . and then it hit me ! bohm , in his own maverick way , appropriated whorf 's answer to heisenberg 's lament in "" an american indian model of the universe "" and substituted more scientifically acceptable terminology ( implicate / explicate rather than manifesting / manifested ) to see how the notion of a universe without linear time would fly in the modern physics and academic community - - and it had qualified success . but - - bohm was no closer to knowing whether whorf had been accurate in his description of hopi than he had been before writing the book . and there had been so much bad press on the guy ! how was one to know , ultimately ? and here 's the part that almost no-one knows so far . in 1991 , in the last few months of his life , david bohm launched his most ambitious thought experiment to date : with some other physicists and a few psychologists and linguists , and sponsored by the fetzer institute , he enticed recognized american indian intellectual leaders ( and some of their elders ) to join in dialogue together in what i can only describe as a roundabout way of asking american indians whether whorf was accurate in his description of the ' timeless ' hopi worldview . but it became so much more ! the american indian leaders there had previously read bohm 's book and others , but the physicists knew nothing about native american worldviews and native american science methodologies , so the indians had to build a bridge over to them in private meetings before the three public days on the themes of time , space and language . during the day on time , whorf 's description of hopi came up , was read out loud , and discussed , though i do n't remember any hopis being present ; nevertheless , the other american indians present , mostly of algonquian tribes , gave what can only be called ' independent verification ' in scientific terminology by saying essentially : well , i can't speak for the hopi people , but that 's pretty much the way we do it . in fact , of the many whorf passages read or discussed in these dialogues , the physicists and the american indians present were usually willing to give whorf his points ( proving again , perhaps , the difficulty of being a prophet in one 's own country / discipline ! ) . but we ' re not done yet - - the best is yet to come - - the actual conclusion of heisenberg 's lament ! at the beginning of the first dialogue it was clear that the quantum physicists had their favorite realm to explore and talk about , and the american indians also had their own favorite realm . as we dialogued , it began becoming clear that those favorite realms had some fundamental principles in common : the only constant is flux ; everything that exists vibrates ; everything is interconnected such that the part implicates the whole . in fact , it became crystal clear that the last major obstacle to these realms being the same realm was really only terminological : the physicists are used to calling it "" the subatomic realm "" whereas the american indians for millennia have been calling it "" the spirit realm "" . now that 's a big enough surprise - - that modern physics is knocking on the door of spirit without really meaning to - - but not big enough , so now let 's take it home ! it puzzled the physicists just how the american indians should have foreknowledge of a realm they should n't know about , that the western scientific infrastructure had just recently led us to - - and the indians had no such scientific infrastructure ! and as the physicists gradually understood that , like hopi , the algonquian grammatical structures do not demand nouns , do not demand fictitious actors to embody actions ( that , as my mikmaq and blackfoot friends tell me , they can talk all day long in those languages and never utter a single ' noun ' ! ) , they finally had to admit that such languages were indeed much better suited to exploring that realm and reporting back than sae languages - - whorf 's reply to heisenberg 's lament was verified and agreed upon . when the phenomena of reality change in a dramatic way , you need to change the tool you ' re using . now , of course , the physicists were left with an even larger puzzle , to wit : how is it that these american indians have a language much better suited than sae languages to investigate and describe the inner workings of the subatomic realm - - a realm they are n't even supposed to know about ! ? ! as you can see by now , pinker - - like all other facile critics and unindicted co-creators of the so-called hypothesis - - is out of his league altogether in attempting to characterize a major player in one of the most important interdisciplinary discussions ever in the history of ideas . pinker , like chomsky , loves logic ( which grows out of the grammar of sae languages just as the philosophy of ' karma ' grew out of the grammar of ancient sanskrit , where it was used earliest as the linguistics term for 'd irect object ' ! ! ) , but has never really gotten with the program this century to replace binary / dualistic thinking with multivariable / multicausal / interdependent systems thinking . whorf heard the call , way back then , and may yet prove to have been an entire century ahead of his time in linguistics . even though we can think in systems for phonology and grammar , we have a tough time doing it for "" language and thought "" ; we feel we have to make them bipolar opposites such that they are distinct and one causes the other invariantly ; that 's why i so admired how slobin finally lost those monolithic terms and framed the question instead in terms of "" thinking for speaking "" - - the at least one kind of thinking where your thinking is very much at the mercy of the forms and categories of your language , per whorf . so tell your students , as i do , that the only way to get to the bottom of what whorf did or did not say is to read his essays in _ language , thought & reality _ for themselves , perhaps with the above thoughts as a guideline , and then figure out for themselves whether the sapir - whorf hypothesis smokescreen makes any sense .",Safe Email

[dude@python dude]$ strings /usr/bin/xine | grep dude

"One scam to rule them all,
One scam to bind them, 
One scan to burn them all, 
And the stupidity bind them. (Yes, i'm ripping, and badly from LOTR) Alright, so NPR's All Things Considered had a wonderful story on the whole Nigerian 419 scams that seem to be running
into my inbox constantly (Thanks FoRK!) Turns out, these 419 scams (419 is the statute in Nigeria that this particular form
of fraud falls under) have actually snared a few people -- NPR reported to the tune of 100 million dollars over a few years, in the US alone.One website listed the 419 scam as being the 'third to fith largest industry in Nigeria' (1), netting billions of dollars
from around the world.   Its large enough to warrant a governmental investigation and a special number to call and report
(to the secret service, no less) scam abuse. (2)   Folks are apparently being held for ransom if they decide to go
'check out' the scam.  (3).Listen to the NPR article (4).   What's great about NPR is the commentary at the end. Turns out, this is all unbelievably
common.   The origination, at least to NPR's knowledge, starts with the scam elements being transposed from Nigeria,
to London, England.   Instead of the bereved widow of a Nigerian national, the originating con was directed to the 'heirs'
of Sir Frances Drake's estate.   If you were 'chosen' as an heir, you could contribute a portion of your money so that a
fellow heir (and scam artist) could reclaim the monetary largess in the Court of England, by proving that Elizabeth I had
nulled Sir Drake's will and taken his fortune as her own.   Oscar
Hartzell, the gent who started this scam, way back in the early 1800s,
managed to gain quite a fortune, all on the backs of idiots.   Sound familiar?A fool and his money, deserve to be parted. (1) http://home.rica.net/alphae/419coal/
(2) 'If you have received a letter, but have not lost any monies to this scheme, please fax a copy of that letter to
(202) 406-5031.'  From:  http://www.secretservice.gov/alert419.shtml  --
They also have a number for those idiots who have lost their money to this.

"" while such a wording sounds rather modest , the actual implementation in his book , if viewed within the framework of his time , might very appropriately be called revolutionary . he broke with august schleicher 's distinction between 'd evelopment ' ( in prehistorical time ) and 'd ecay ' ( in historical time ) in the history of language and replaced it with his notion of continuous , uninterrupted development . his survey of the relevant literature of his time is almost exhaustive , and his findings serve as the solid stepping stone for his own advances . to facilitate reading , the editor has supplied an index of names ( with life dates ) , a complete listing of the literature referred to by scherer as well as an introduction to scherer 's life and his general scholarly achievements . towards a history of the basque language jose ignacio hualde , joseba a . lakarra & r . l . trask ( eds . ) 1995 365 pp . current issues in linguistic theory , 131 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 585 0 price : us $ 90 . 00 rest of world : cloth : 90 272 3634 8 price : hfl . 150 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com questions related to the origin and history of the basque language spark considerable interest , since it is the only surviving pre - indo - european language in western europe . however , until now , there was no readily available source in english providing answers to these questions or giving an overview of past and current research in this area . this book is intended to partly fill this void . the book contains both state-of - the-art papers which summarize our knowledge about particular areas of basque historical linguistics , and articles presenting new hypotheses and points of view based on hard evidence and careful analysis . all contributors to this volume have demonstrated expertise in the topic within basque historical linguistics that their chapter addresses . two classical articles by the late luis michelena are included in english translation . in addition , the book includes studies on diachronic phonology , morphology and syntax . the relation of basque to other languages is also investigated in a couple of chapters . english historical linguistics 1994 . papers from the 8th international conference on english historical linguistics ( 8 icehl , edinburgh , 19-23 september 1994 ) 1996 viii , 403 pp . current issues in linguistic theory , 135 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 590 7 price : us $ 84 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 3639 9 price : hfl . 150 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com this volume offers a selection of 19 papers from those read at the 8th international conference on english historical linguistics . the topics discussed span the whole history of english from the common germanic period to the present century . the book also includes , as appropriate to the conference venue , a number of papers on the aspects of the historical development of scots and scottish english . historical pragmatics . pragmatic developments in the history of english andreas h . jucker ( ed . ) 1995 xvi , 624 pp . pragmatics & beyond new series , 35 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 328 9 price : us $ 97 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 5047 2 price : hfl . 170 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com until very recently , pragmatics has been restricted to the analysis of contemporary spoken language while historical linguistics has studied historical texts and language change in a decontextualized way . this has now radically changed and scholars from around the world are trying to build a new theoretical framework that integrates recent advances both in pragmatics and in historical linguistics . this volume , which contains 22 original titles , starts with an introduction that is both a state-of - the-art account of historical pragmatics and a programmatic statement of its future potential and its different subfields . part i contains seven pragmaphilological papers that deal with historical texts and their interpretations by paying close attention to the communicative context of these texts . the second and third parts comprise papers in diachronic pragmatics . the ten papers of part ii take a linguistic form as their starting point , e . g . particular lexical items or syntactic constructions , and study their pragmatic functions at different times ( diachronic form-to - function mappings ) , while the four papers of part iii take a particular pragmatic function as their starting point . e . g . discourse strategies or politeness , and study their linguistic realisation at different times ( diachronic function-to - form mappings ) . contributions by : c . allen ;

"Long time no chat!How have you been? If you've been like me, you've been trying
trying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight.Â  I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.Â  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""Â  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.Â  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!Â  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.Â  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.Â I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! Here is the bottom line ...I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.Â  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!Â  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.Â  This is my
pledge to you.BONUS! Order now and get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!Â  To order Extreme Power Plus on our secure server, just click

"eskimo words for "" snow "" , "" ice "" , etc . as an eskimologist and an anthropologist , i strongly concur with woodbury 's and hill 's recent messages on the topic . i have two responses : one to the person who suggested that maybe what was peculiar about eskimo words for snow is not the number of lexical items to be found in a dictionary , but rather that these words are used more often and even by non-specialists within the culture . i am sorry that i can't track down the name of this person , which i must have deleted by mistake . but this is an interesting idea . my answer is that eskimos talk about snow about as often as a sahara tuareg would talk about rain , in other words , not very often . remember that the arctic is technically a desert ; i . e . there is very little precipitation , although whatever snow that does fall remains on the ground , an ~ rd is blown a } iround into funny shapes , for which there is of course , a technical terminology , used mainly by huntersd who need to use these things as landmarks . snow ( as a ground cover or falling ) is really not very important to eskimos . i suggest that we start looking at some of the languages of the subarctic groups of canada ( cree , chipewyan ) , these people live in deep snow , and probably talk about it a lot more ! my second response is for george fowler who suggest that there might be an fashion of eskimo words for - - - - - going on . he talks about 50 words for ice in greenlandic . he was speaking facetiously , of course , but there is a point to be made here . eskimos who hunt on ice ( such as the siberian yupik eskimos i worked with ) have an incredibly detailed technical terminology for ice conditions , icebergs , ice thickness and movements . for eskimo hunters , these things are concretely a matter of life and death . so eskimos do have many words for ice , and as for snow , this is a technical terminology , and as for snow , it is entirely based on a few stems that actually mean "" ice "" , and on many stems that do not fundamentally mean "" ice "" . so , at least in some eskimo languages , such as cnetral siberian yupik eskimo , there are actually more expressions ( or if you want "" words "" ) for "" ice "" than for "" snow "" . for the definition of a "" word "" and "" stem "" in eskimo , i refer y ' all back to woodbury 's statement . the point is that technical terminology for things that interest eskimos is no different from technical terminology that is relevant to , say , swiss cuckoo clock makers . willem j . de reuse dept . of anthropology university of arizona tucson , az 85721",Safe Email

it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair,

"On The Way to Telluride, On My Way Back to the World8/29/02Dear friends,I go to turn my computer on but I have forgotten where the on/off switch
is. I have had this laptop for three years, but I haven't turned it on for
the past two months. I look on its left side, I feel around the back, I
find it on the right and I feel like an idiot. The screen reads ""fatal
error"" and offers to ""save"" whatever I had typed on it last June 21st, a
few weeks before my mother died. I hit CTL.ALT.DEL. and it is gone. Gone.
Gone like this long, sad, summer, frozen now, and nothing seemingly matters
but everything matters more now than ever before. Why did she have to die?
When will this pain stop? I got up this morning to fly out to Colorado. The Telluride Film Festival
is screening my film tomorrow night, the first time it will be shown in the
United States. My mother did not get to see this new film. She was always
so proud of everything I did, cheering me on every day from the day where
my memory begins. I had shown an early cut of the film to my friends last
winter in my parent's living room, and mom would come in and out of the
room, catching a scene here and there, saying, ""Boy, that's something,
isn't it!"" I don't feel right, right now. I have avoided most people for the past two
months. I can't conceive in my mind having to face a crowd of strangers, no
matter how supportive or appreciative they may be. Everyone says to me it
will be good to get back to work, good to be busy, take my mind off my
sadness, as if not aware that what I really might need is for it to be the
other way around. At my family's insistence, I tried going on TV a few
weeks ago to talk about the corporate crooks roaming our great land. I had
decided to give it a try, and gave it my best shot, and ended up feeling so
empty and more alone. I had agreed to go on ""Crossfire"" and Donahue (thank
God for this guy!) on the condition that I would not have to have one of
those stupid cable news shouting matches with three rightwingnuts where no
one can hear (or wants to hear) what's being said. They agreed to the terms, but as Bob Novak asked his first question about
aren't my true motives to destroy capitalism and make America a socialist
country, I just sat there for a moment and didn't respond. I thought I
would just take the microphone off and leave - who needs these f-----s! -
but then, my dad was with me in the studio and I looked over at him and
smiled, and then into the camera I said, yes, Bob, that is exactly what I
intend to do and, considering more people have bought my book than any
other nonfiction book in America this year, I guess that means that the
majority of Americans agree with me on this point, so look out Bob 'cause
we're going to seize your money first! I asked the studio audience in DC
for a show of hands of all those who agreed and I was later told that
numerous hands shot up in the air, much to the chagrin of a stunned Bob
Novak. I also added that I thought the Pope was onto something when he said
that capitalism is a ""sin.""My dad liked that. He is a sweet, strong, smart man and I loved the drive
with him back home. We took a spin through the Michigan State campus and he
told me how he had come down here after World War II to inquire about going
to college but thought it best to return to the assembly line where he had
a secure job. His years during the war serving in the Marines were going to
be counted toward his seniority. And so he worked the spark plug and oil
filter assembly line for 33 years and provided for mom and us kids and gave
us all his love -- which, of course, mattered the most.                       *        *       *       *       *        *Dad took me to the airport this morning, remarking on the way how much mom
would have enjoyed this simple trip across town to Bishop Airport, how
happy she would have been knowing that I was heading off on a new journey
in my very fortunate life. I thought about how she came to New York for the
screening of ""Roger & Me"" at the New York Film Festival in 1989, and how I
got to introduce her and my aunt as they sat in the front of the balcony,
and how mom and Aunt Lois stood and took a long Lincoln Center bow, and how
I stood on that stage and felt that she deserved every bit of that applause
and more. It's a bittersweet memory now, as I've just found out that the NYFF
selection committee this year is too afraid to show my new film.
""Politics,"" is what I have been told. Too ""populist"" for the new elite who
now sit in judgment of what is art. ""They don't want to help further your
platform Mike,"" a person close to the committee tells me. ""One of them even
said, 'I know this film is going to be popular - and I don't personally
want to contribute to its popularity.'""  So, it was decided that ""Bowling
for Columbine,"" a Cannes prize-winner, knighted by the Chicago Tribune as
""one of the most effective political/polemical films ever,"" a film chosen
by every single film festival around the world this fall - no, this film
must not be shown at Lincoln Center just six blocks from the edit room
where we made it... 77 blocks north of ground zero. I've gone too far this
time, cut too close to the bone, stuck my lens where it doesn't belong -
right straight through the heart of an America that is both master and
victim of the ultra-violence. It is so sad to see this place where I will
always remember my mother taking that bow now cowering to the whims of neos
who, like their counterparts in Hollywood, preside over the demolition of a
once great art form.                     *      *      *      *      *      *      *My dad drops me off and goes to park in the short-term lot. He comes inside
just as the airport personnel are taking everything out of my suitcase for
inspection. They don't ask to see the print of the film, the only thing I
might have had on me that is poised to do any real damage (to all the right
people, of course). My dad and I stop short of the metal detectors and the
next round of inspectors who are anxious to look at my smelly feet. We hug,
and he kisses me, and I am trying hard, so very hard, to not break down in
the middle of this airport. He tells me not to worry about him, and I tell
him I'll call him from Detroit when I am changing planes. I go through
security and as I am being taken aside to be searched again, I look back
and see him still standing there, watching out for me. My dad.I'm on the plane and I'm thirsty, but I took the water bottle out of my bag
when I packed it this morning. The bottle, half-drank, had been sitting
untouched in my untouched bag since I stuck it in there the night we had to
rush my mom to the hospital. The bottle was still there in that overnight
bag where I put my t-shirt and sweatpants, the ones I had on for the night
and day I sat by my mother's side in the hospital as she struggled to live,
holding her hand, holding her head, trying to comfort her, strands of hair
on my sweater. I can see the stains from where my tears and mucus ran
uncontrollably down my face and onto that sweater. The doctor said she had
an 80% chance of making it. An hour before she died, another doctor said
the chances were 1 in 100. That was good enough for me. One in one hundred!
I've had those odds! I won! Don't let her die! Please do everything you can
do! Don't let her die.The priest came, then another priest came, and when the priests left my dad
asked us three kids and the three grandkids to all join hands and say our
goodbyes to mom, say whatever we wanted to about what she meant to us. (I
am sorry... I cannot complete this paragraph right now, I can't see the
screen through the tears...maybe someday...)The night before we rushed her to the hospital I had a little surprise
planned for her. I had brought a copy of my new movie and I was going to
show it to her. As the end credits would roll, she would get to see what
she has seen at the end of all of my work: her name along with my dad's in
that list of credits...and, to me, it's the only real credit that ever
mattered -- because without them I would not have the life they gave me,
the way they raised me... it is all a privilege I will never cease being
thankful for.I never got to show her the movie that night. ""Mike!"" she called out from
the porch, in a pitch of voice I had never heard. ""Get your father! I don't
feel good."" She was, without warning, dying. Within 48 hours she would be
gone.                 *          *          *          *          *          *I'm walking through the Detroit airport to gate 75 for the flight to
Denver, and I hear someone say, ""OK, Mr. Stuckup, just walk right on by!"" I
turn to see it is one of anchors from the local TV station in Flint. I
apologize. My sunglasses are on. I have been crying since I left my dad at
the Flint airport. I explain this to her and she starts to get tears in her
eyes. ""My mom died in October,"" she says, and I realize that this pain that
feels so solitary is, truthfully, a shared experience amongst us all. No
one is immune from this loss. But instead of taking the time to tell me
about how rough it has been for HER, she asks about how I am doing and how
is my dad doing and did we get the flowers she and the others sent. She
gives me her number and says to call anytime if I feel the need to talk. At
that moment I remember what she told me -- that her mother also died this
year-- and I think, man, get over yourself, Mike, you are not alone in
this, and so I ask her how she is doing. ""I think a lot,"" she says, ""about
all the things she won't see my two children grow up to do, to be. But I
believe she is in my heart, right here, right now, and she will see it
all.""They call my flight and I rush over to the payphone to call my dad to see
if he got home OK. He tells me that when he left the short- term lot he got
talking to the person in the tollbooth who told him about her mother
getting cancer and how she was caring for her. ""She said that her bill in
the hospital came to $60,000,"" he says with astonishment. ""They won't be
able to pay it. She makes six dollars an hour, no health insurance. I gave
her a tip along with the toll.""""You gave the tollbooth worker a tip?""""Well, you have to. That person could be you or me.""That is my father. That was my mother. Yours, Michael Moore

"misattribution. I did not write the blurb below. I made one statement about VP Cheney only, to wit, that he has a short memory.I couldn't agree with you more on this: ""in short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just that: horseshit, happy or otherwise,"" however, I resent being lumped in a zero-sum-zealot category for suggesting nothing more than that rich and successful at face value is apropos of nothing and I am beginning to understand that people who immediately and so fiercely object to my ad hominem (re Cheney) align themselves weird sylogisms like ""if rich then deservedly"" or ""if rich then smarter."" Given that, I am also beginning to understand why some people NEED to be rich.WRT to meritocracies - all hail, meritocracies! WRT Harvard: over 90% of 2002 graduates were cum laude +. INTERESTING curve. Those eager to be measured got their wish; those unwashed shy folk who just live it provide the balast.Speaking of Forbes, was reading about Peter Norton just today in an old issue while waiting for my doctor.

Can you say ""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school, like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of *those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.] The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a ""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the best school possible.Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard, for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it, ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the years for proof.Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course, Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades, and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in. The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal"" degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is* smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful, much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*. There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case, intelligence and effort.[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you, apparently.]BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country, *including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes, all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition, most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have *much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as Santa Claus come election time... In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.Cheers, RAH-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: PGP 7.5iQA/AwUBPY511cPxH8jf3ohaEQLAsgCfZhsQMSvUy6GqJ5wgL52DwZKpIhMAnRuR YYboc+IcylP5TlKL58jpwEfu =z877 -----END PGP SIGNATURE------- ----------------- R.

"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2515127.stmA bizarre collection of stuffed animals could fetch up to Â£2m when it is
sold by a Cornwall museum.
The Museum of Curiosities is home to a menagerie of 10,000 Victorian stuffed
animals.
The museum, next to the Jamaica Inn on Bodmin Moor, gets about 30,000
visitors a year.
But now the inn's owner Kevin Moore has decided to sell.Stuffed frogs are for saleMr Moore said: ""It was very fashionable to have taxidermy on your
mantlepiece in Victorian times, but it is not really in favour now.""
Nevertheless, figures of up to Â£2m for the collection have been discussed.
The museum was opened in 1861 by taxidermist Walter Potter.
Tableaux include a kittens tea party, cricket-playing guinea pigs and
swinging frogs.

"Well, after playing around with these strange wav files I realised I didn't 
even have sox installed. A quick apt-get install sox fixed this.Sox does reconise these AND even plays them in stereo! Following info from 
the CD-Writing HOW-TO I used sox to convert the Sgt Pepper's wav to cdr and 
wrote it to CD and now I've got a CD with ONE track that is the entire Sgt 
Peppers Album! Not too sure how over 500M of cdr reduces to only 51M of wav 
file but there it is?!?!And I've got loads of Beatles Albums and singles in these strange wav files!KEWL! Now I don't need to go buying them!Cheers,	John Gay

report vs revoke. If everybody except one says that a mail is spam, the
one guy will see his trust go down dramatically. If you are with the
majority, your trust goes up. If you are against the majority, your
trust goes down. If people 50-50, whatever you vote, your neither
against the majority nor with it, so your trust won't change. So your
""gray"" mail won't have much influence on your trust (neither good nor
bad, just... gray)-------------------------------------------------------

    Message-ID:  <1030372078.11075.TMDA@deepeddy.vircio.com>  | Tell me what keystroke made it happen so I can reproduce it and I'll
  | see what I can do about it (or if I can't, I'll hand it off to Brent).Don't worry too much about it, you seem to have plenty of other things
to do in the immediate future, and this one isn't so critical that people
can't use the code in normal ways.But, to make it happen, type (with normal key bindings) any digit, so the
code thinks you're trying a message number, then backspace, so the digit
goes away, then '-' (other junk characters don't seem to have the
problem, I have just been playing).   That will do it (every time).That is: 0 ^h -Once you get into that state, the same traceback occurs for every
character you type, until a message is selected with the mouse.This is looking like it might be easy to find and fix, so I'll take a
look at it later.kre_______________________________________________

"special issue machine translation : final call for papers final call for papers the machine translation journal special issue on anaphora resolution in machine translation guest editor : ruslan mitkov ( university of wolverhampton ) the interpretation of anaphora is crucial for the successful operation of a machine translation system . in particular , it is essential to resolve the anaphoric relation when translating into languages which mark the gender of pronouns . unfortunately , the majority of mt systems developed in the seventies and eighties did not adequately address the problems of identifying the antecedents of anaphors in the source language and producing the anaphoric "" equivalents "" in the target language . as a consequence , only a limited number of mt systems have been successful in translating discourse , rather than isolated sentences . one reason for this situation is that in addition to anaphora resolution being itself a very complicated task , translation adds a further dimension to the problem in that the reference to a discourse entity encoded by a source language anaphor by the speaker ( or writer ) has not only to be identified by the hearer ( translator or translation system ) but also re-encoded in a coreferential expression in a different language . the nineties have seen an intensification of research efforts in anaphora resolution in machine translation . this can be seen in the growing number of related projects which have reported promising new results ( e . g . wada 1990 ; leass & schwall 1991 ; nakaiwa & ikehara 1992 ; chen 1992 ; saggion & carvalho 1994 ; preuss et al . 1994 ; nakaiwa et al . 1994 ; nakaiwa et al . 1995 ; nakaiwa & ikehara 1995 ; mitkov et al . 1995 ; mitkov et al . 1997 ; geldbach 1997 ) . however , we still feel that additional work is needed to highlight and further explore the specifics of the problem in operational mt environments , including fully automatic machine translation and machine - aided translation . we are inviting high-quality , original research papers describing recent advances in anaphora resolution in machine translation . topics to be addressed include ( but are not limited to ) - operational anaphora resolution components in machine translation - resolution of zero pronouns in mt environments - lexical transfer of anaphors across languages - to what extent have the latest trends towards knowledge-poor , corpus - driven and robust approaches in anaphora resolution , been called upon in machine translation ? - what are the most scalable contributory factors / resolution strategies in mt ? - what makes anaphora resolution a more complex task in machine translation ? - multilingual anaphora resolution submission and format articles should be submitted directly to the publishers , either by e-mail to ellen . klink @ wkap . nl , with the subject header "" submission to coat anaphora special issue "" , or in hard-copy to machine translation editorial office kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 990 3300 az dordrecht the netherlands or machine translation editorial office kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 230 accord , ma 02018-023 u . s . a . the submission deadline is 15 may 1998 . the journal is typeset using latex , so the preferred medium for submission of articles in electronic format is latex source ( using the kluwer style file ) or gzipped postscript . for more details , please consult the journal 's web pages : home page : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / journalhome . htm / 0922-6567 instructions for authors : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / kaphtml . htm / ifa0922-6567 latex style files : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / jrnlstyle . htm / 0922-6567 if submitting hard-copy , four copies of the paper are required . the length of the papers should be approximately 10-20 pages if using the kluwer style file ( around 20k words ) . authors are also requested to send a copy of an abstract of not more than 200 words to the guest editor r . mitkov @ wlv . ac . uk or in hard-copy to ruslan mitkov , school of languages and european studies , university of wolverhampton , stafford st . , wolverhampton wv1 1sb , united kingdom . guest editor : ruslan mitkov school of languages and european studies university of wolverhampton stafford st . wolverhampton wv1 1sb telephone ( 44-1902 ) 322471 fax ( 44-1902 ) 322739 email r . mitkov @ wlv . ac . uk guest editorial board : breck baldwin ( university of pennsylvania , philadelphia ) david carter ( sri international , cambridge ) guenter goerz ( university of nuernberg / erlangen ) lynette hirschman ( mitre , mclean ) richard kittredge ( university of montreal ) susan luperfoy ( mitre , mclean ) tony mcenery ( lancaster university ) ruslan mitkov ( university of wolverhampton ) frederique segond ( ranx xerox , grenoble ) harold somers ( umist , manchester ) keh - yih su ( national tsing hua university , taiwan ) yorick wilks ( university of sheffield )",Safe Email

Dear Friend,This last summer, our family had a big reunion at a fabulous resort in 
Minnesota. Â The water was sapphire blue and the evergreens sang as the 
breeze rustled their limbs. Â We had such a great time renewing old 
friendships, seeing how everyone's children had grown, and catching up on 
everyone's lives. Â The last day we had a family picture taken, thinking 
that we'd all send them out as our Christmas cards.In October we got the proofs back so that we could pick our favorite picture. 
Everybody looked wonderful and the background was spectacular but I could not 
find myself in the picture. Â I looked and looked and finally got out a 
magnifying glass. Â To my horror, I found this dark curly headed woman 
with a face that looked like a stretched moon!!! Â Dear God it was me!!! 
Â My body resembled an inflated hot air balloon that would take off should 
a heavy wind arise... it was HIDEOUS! Â I had mirrors in my house but most of them were 
designed to only reflect Â from the waist up and I honestly hadn't noticed 
that my cheekbones had totally disappeared and that my face looked like a 
shapeless clump of flesh. Â I was always so happy that I didn't have a lot 
of wrinkles, Â but I didn't realize that I wasn't wrinkled because my skin 
was as stretched as tight as a bongo drum.Well, this situation was NOT  acceptable. Â But I was at a loss as to what to do. 
Â My willpower, well, basically sucks and I had so-o-o much weight to lose 
that I wasn't sure I'd live long enough to get it all off. Â Plus, I hate 
diets and can only stick to them for a very short period of time before I fall 
off the food wagon. Â My goal to slim down seemed totally hopeless.AND THEN 
IT HAPPENED. Â I received a brochure about a product called 
BERRY TRIM 
PLUS. Â It seemed to contain everything I needed. Â 
It curbs your appetite, increases energy, burns fat at the fastest rate 
possible, no special diets are required, you don't have to exercise like a 
lunatic, it doesn't make you feel speeded, Â AND IT 'S ALL NATURAL WITH NO 
ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS. Â It also was priced well below other products so 
I figured that if it didn't work I wouldn't be out much money. Â It is 
guaranteed, but I'm always too lazy to bother to send back the empty bottles 
so this diet supplement seemed perfect for me.It's been about 6 weeks now but I swear I'm beginning to look like that 
famous Cindy person that models. Â My cheekbones are absolutely glorious.. 
I swear I look like a new person and a good one at that. Â BERRY TRIM 
PLUS  also keeps your skin tight so you don't look like a 
Shar Pei with nasty folds of skin hanging all around after you lose the weight.
I promise you that this product works. Â It does everything it promises 
and then some. Â Just losing the weight alone, makes you feel so much 
better and younger. Â It puts zest back into your life and assures you 
that you'll achieve your weight loss goals. Â In another few weeks I will 
reach my goal...something I had given up on. Â Also, HLNA  offers an affiliate 
program so you might as well make a few bucks while losing those pounds.
Please keep the faith and order this product NOW  by clicking below.CLICK

fit the pieces together?""Chesapeake Skipjacks"" are a class of boats:

Chesapeake Bay Log Canoe, the Brogan, and the famous
Clipper Ships."" Clipper Ships (Chips)?  Chesapeake College's mascot(s) is(are) the Skipjacks:

"comparative method in response to poser , nichols does on p . 6 of her book claim that there is no way for the comparative method to distinguish between nostratic and "" a much larger grouping of most lineages of the old world and new world "" , that is , as she herself says , between hypothetical groupings of around c . 12000 and c . 40000 years ago , and she does say that this "" because the cut-off point is so shallow "" , the cut-off point being the ceiling of 6000-10000 years which she imposes ( wihout any basis , as noted in my earlier messages ) on the comparative method . since this amounts to a rejection of the nostratic hypothesis ( not as false perhaps but as unverifiable / unfalsifiable , i guess ) , this means that i am right and poser is wrong about whether there have been people who have rejected particular theories of linguistic relationship on the basis of this mythical ceiling idea . in response to teeter : i think ( and i hope karl will endorse this ) that our disagreements are really quite minor , but they are real as far as they go . for example , while karl is obviously 100 % right about meillet 's position in the scientia article ( where meillet says that lexical comparisons can never prove a relationship , and only morphological ones can ) , in his 1925 book meillet repeatedly states that you can establish a linguistic relationship purely on the basis of lexical correspondences , makes the same point that i have been making over and over again here on linguist that for some language families this is the only way of showing relationship since they lack morphology , and even makes the same point that i did about how certain things can only be done once you have established , at least tentatively , that the languages you are dealing with are related . as a matter of fact , he even shows how you could demonstrate the relatedness of the romance languages purely on the basis of a lexical comparison , using the numerals 1-10 , and then shows how you could do that for the older indo - european languages too ( although there he begins to slip in a little morphology ) . i would also like to add that i think it is a serious mistake to pretend that there are no models for comparative linguistics besides indo - european , because it is so utterly atypical of the language families of the world . there are plenty of equally well established families , several of which are older in the only sense that matters , that is , not in years before the present but in years before the earliest written records and many of which are more useful models for those working on families not yet established ( afroasiatic , austronesian , austroasiatic , uto - aztecan , altaic , etc . ) . which is not to say that there is anything wrong with knowing as much as possible about ie , but rather that there is much wrong with knowing naught but indo - european . i am not sure but i think that this is what eric hamp had in mind in a recent paper in the davis / iverson volume when he complained about how the teaching of historical linguistics is hampered by textbooks which largely draw their material from ie ( or indeed from some favored parts of it , such as romance ) . and i am happy to have sally thomason point out that morphological elements can be borrowed . meillet we must remember was greatly troubled by the possibility of such a thing and of the existence of mixed languages . he tried to debunk every examples around , and thought ( wrongly i think ) that if such languages exist , then they cannot be handled by the comparative method . the fact that such languages do exist ( e . g . , mitchif ) and yet pose no problem ( so that we have no trouble tracing certain parts of mitchif to french and others to cree ) means that meillet was worried for naught . but it also means that language classification on the basis of morphology is no more infallibible than that on the basis oif lexical material . you work with what you have available , which in some cases may be largely morphology and only a few obvious lexical parallels ( that 's how afro - asiatic was first established ) , morphology and lexicon ( indo - european ) , lexicon and a single morphological parallel ( algic , as victor golla reminded me just the other day ) , lexicon only ( vietnames and the rest of mon - khmer ) , and so on and so forth .",Safe Email
"slate's ""today's papers"": The New York Times and Los Angeles Times both lead with word that a federal judge ruled yesterday that the nation's largest national gas pipeline company, El Paso, illegally withheld gas from the market during California's energy squeeze in 2000-01. The judge concluded that El Paso left 21 percent of its capacity in the state off-line, thus driving up the price of gas and helping to induce rolling blackouts. and this is the product of overregulation?-----Original Message----- From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com]On Behalf Of John Hall Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 11:57 PM To: FoRK Subject: liberal defnitions Depends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) over regulation.The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible. It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over spending spreads the damage more evenly. Rent control would be an example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending tons of money on public housing.As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever. The opinion that EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty much anathema to liberal politics.Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private replacements, no government regulation) is better than government regulation itself.And in my experience people who label themselves 'Green' (which does not include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a watermelon. > -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Geege > Schuman > > funny. i read it as green = red, as in accounting, as in fiscally > irresponsible. which do you think is the worse indictment - > overregulation > or overspending? there are many (dickheads) who buy into the > neo-conservative media's (fox's) definiton of ""liberal"" as ""one who seeks > to > impose both.""",Safe Email

by NICHOLAS LEMANN
The Bush Administration may have a brand-new doctrine of power.
Issue of 2002-04-01
Posted 2002-03-25When there is a change of command-and not just in government-the new people
often persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyone
suspected. This feeling seems especially intense in the Bush
Administration, perhaps because Bill Clinton has been bracketed by a
father-son team. It's easy for people in the Administration to believe
that, after an unfortunate eight-year interlude, the Bush family has
resumed its governance-and about time, too.The Bush Administration's sense that the Clinton years were a waste, or
worse, is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs.
Republicans tend to regard Democrats as untrustworthy in defense and
foreign policy, anyway, in ways that coincide with what people think of as
Clinton's weak points: an eagerness to please, a lack of discipline.
Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national-security adviser, wrote an article in
Foreign Affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused Clinton
of ""an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of the
commander in chief."" Most of the top figures in foreign affairs in this
Administration also served under the President's father. They took office
last year, after what they regard as eight years of small-time flyswatting
by Clinton, thinking that they were picking up where they'd left off.Not long ago, I had lunch with-sorry!-a senior Administration
foreign-policy official, at a restaurant in Washington called the Oval
Room. Early in the lunch, he handed me a twenty-seven- page report, whose
cover bore the seal of the Department of Defense, an outline map of the
world, and these words:Defense Strategy for the 1990s:
The Regional Defense Strategy
Secretary of Defense
Dick Cheney
January 1993One of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government is
communicating its drama. Actors, professional athletes, and even elected
politicians train for years, go through a great winnowing, and then perform
publicly. People who have titles like Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
are just as ambitious and competitive, have worked just as long and hard,
and are often playing for even higher stakes-but what they do all day is go
to meetings and write memos and prepare briefings. How, possibly, to
explain that some of the documents, including the report that the senior
official handed me, which was physically indistinguishable from a
high-school term paper, represent the government version of playing
Carnegie Hall?After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dick Cheney, then the Secretary of
Defense, set up a ""shop,"" as they say, to think about American foreign
policy after the Cold War, at the grand strategic level. The project, whose
existence was kept quiet, included people who are now back in the game, at
a higher level: among them, Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of
Defense; Lewis Libby, Cheney's chief of staff; and Eric Edelman, a senior
foreign-policy adviser to Cheney-generally speaking, a cohesive group of
conservatives who regard themselves as bigger-thinking, tougher-minded, and
intellectually bolder than most other people in Washington. (Donald
Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, shares these characteristics, and has
been closely associated with Cheney for more than thirty years.) Colin
Powell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, mounted a
competing, and presumably more ideologically moderate, effort to reimagine
American foreign policy and defense. A date was set-May 21, 1990-on which
each team would brief Cheney for an hour; Cheney would then brief President
Bush, after which Bush would make a foreign-policy address unveiling the
new grand strategy.Everybody worked for months on the ""five-twenty-one brief,"" with a sense
that the shape of the post-Cold War world was at stake. When Wolfowitz and
Powell arrived at Cheney's office on May 21st, Wolfowitz went first, but
his briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour, and Cheney (a hawk who,
perhaps, liked what he was hearing) did not call time on him. Powell didn't
get to present his alternate version of the future of the United States in
the world until a couple of weeks later. Cheney briefed President Bush,
using material mostly from Wolfowitz, and Bush prepared his major
foreign-policy address. But he delivered it on August 2, 1990, the day that
Iraq invaded Kuwait, so nobody noticed.The team kept working. In 1992, the Times got its hands on a version of the
material, and published a front-page story saying that the Pentagon
envisioned a future in which the United States could, and should, prevent
any other nation or alliance from becoming a great power. A few weeks of
controversy ensued about the Bush Administration's hawks being
""unilateral""-controversy that Cheney's people put an end to with denials
and the counter-leak of an edited, softer version of the same material.As it became apparent that Bush was going to lose to Clinton, the Cheney
team's efforts took on the quality of a parting shot. The report that the
senior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days before
Clinton took office. It is a somewhat bland, opaque document-a ""scrubbed,""
meaning unclassified, version of something more candid-but it contained the
essential ideas of ""shaping,"" rather than reacting to, the rest of the
world, and of preventing the rise of other superpowers. Its tone is one of
skepticism about diplomatic partnerships. A more forthright version of the
same ideas can be found in a short book titled ""From Containment to Global
Leadership?,"" which Zalmay Khalilzad, who joined Cheney's team in 1991 and
is now special envoy to Afghanistan, published a couple of years into the
Clinton Administration, when he was out of government. It recommends that
the United States ""preclude the rise of another global rival for the
indefinite future."" Khalilzad writes, ""It is a vital U.S. interest to
preclude such a development-i.e., to be willing to use force if necessary
for the purpose.""When George W. Bush was campaigning for President, he and the people around
him didn't seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift, along the lines of
the policy of containment of the Soviet Union's sphere of influence which
the United States maintained during the Cold War. In his first major
foreign-policy speech, delivered in November of 1999, Bush declared that ""a
President must be a clear-eyed realist,"" a formulation that seems to
connote an absence of world-remaking ambition. ""Realism"" is exactly the
foreign-policy doctrine that Cheney's Pentagon team rejected, partly
because it posits the impossibility of any one country's ever dominating
world affairs for any length of time.One gets many reminders in Washington these days of how much the terrorist
attacks of September 11th have changed official foreign-policy thinking.
Any chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what Bush
has done so far-made war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda and enhanced domestic
security. It is only now, six months after the attacks, that we are truly
entering the realm of Presidential choice, and all indications are that
Bush is going to use September 11th as the occasion to launch a new,
aggressive American foreign policy that would represent a broad change in
direction rather than a specific war on terrorism. All his rhetoric,
especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of Congress
since September 11th, and all the information about his state of mind which
his aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation's moment of
destiny-a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging,
because it enhances Bush's stature and opens the way to more assertive
policymaking.Inside government, the reason September 11th appears to have been ""a
transformative moment,"" as the senior official I had lunch with put it, is
not so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials
had previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the American
public's usual resistance to American military involvement overseas, at
least for a while. The Clinton Administration, beginning with the ""Black
Hawk Down"" operation in Mogadishu, during its first year, operated on the
conviction that Americans were highly averse to casualties; the all-bombing
Kosovo operation, in Clinton's next-to-last year, was the ideal foreign
military adventure. Now that the United States has been attacked, the
options are much broader. The senior official approvingly mentioned a 1999
study of casualty aversion by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies,
which argued that the ""mass public"" is much less casualty-averse than the
military or the civilian Ã©lite believes; for example, the study showed that
the public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to
prevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (The American
death total in the Vietnam War was about fifty-eight thousand.) September
11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further.Recently, I went to the White House to interview Condoleezza Rice. Rice's
Foreign Affairs article from 2000 begins with this declaration: ""The United
States has found it exceedingly difficult to define its 'national interest'
in the absence of Soviet power."" I asked her whether that is still the
case. ""I think the difficulty has passed in defining a role,"" she said
immediately. ""I think September 11th was one of those great earthquakes
that clarify and sharpen. Events are in much sharper relief."" Like Bush,
she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weapons
of mass destruction ""in the hands of irresponsible states"" now define the
national interest. (The latter goal, by the way, is new-in Bush's speech to
Congress on September 20th, America's sole grand purpose was ending
terrorism.) We talked in her West Wing office; its tall windows face the
part of the White House grounds where television reporters do their
standups. In her bearing, Rice seemed less crisply military than she does
in public. She looked a little tired, but she was projecting a kind of
missionary calm, rather than belligerence.In the Foreign Affairs article, Rice came across as a classic realist,
putting forth ""the notions of power politics, great powers, and power
balances"" as the proper central concerns of the United States. Now she
sounded as if she had moved closer to the one-power idea that Cheney's
Pentagon team proposed ten years ago-or, at least, to the idea that the
other great powers are now in harmony with the United States, because of
the terrorist attacks, and can be induced to remain so. ""Theoretically, the
realists would predict that when you have a great power like the United
States it would not be long before you had other great powers rising to
challenge it or trying to balance against it,"" Rice said. ""And I think what
you're seeing is that there's at least a predilection this time to move to
productive and coÃ¶perative relations with the United States, rather than to
try to balance the United States. I actually think that statecraft matters
in how it all comes out. It's not all foreordained.""Rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of the
National Security Council and asked them to think seriously about ""how do
you capitalize on these opportunities"" to fundamentally change American
doctrine, and the shape of the world, in the wake of September 11th. ""I
really think this period is analogous to 1945 to 1947,"" she said-that is,
the period when the containment doctrine took shape-""in that the events so
clearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat, and that it's a big
global threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normally
thought of as being in the coalition. That has started shifting the
tectonic plates in international politics. And it's important to try to
seize on that and position American interests and institutions and all of
that before they harden again.""The National Security Council is legally required to produce an annual
document called the National Security Strategy, stating the over-all goals
of American policy-another government report whose importance is great but
not obvious. The Bush Administration did not produce one last year, as the
Clinton Administration did not in its first year. Rice said that she is
working on the report now.""There are two ways to handle this document,"" she told me. ""One is to do it
in a kind of minimalist way and just get it out. But it's our view that,
since this is going to be the first one for the Bush Administration, it's
important. An awful lot has happened since we started this process, prior
to 9/11. I can't give you a certain date when it's going to be out, but I
would think sometime this spring. And it's important that it be a real
statement of what the Bush Administration sees as the strategic direction
that it's going.""It seems clear already that Rice will set forth the hope of a more dominant
American role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago. Some
questions that don't appear to be settled yet, but are obviously being
asked, are how much the United States is willing to operate alone in
foreign affairs, and how much change it is willing to try to engender
inside other countries-and to what end, and with what means. The leak a
couple of weeks ago of a new American nuclear posture, adding offensive
capability against ""rogue states,"" departed from decades of official
adherence to a purely defensive position, and was just one indication of
the scope of the reconsideration that is going on. Is the United States now
in a position to be redrawing regional maps, especially in the Middle East,
and replacing governments by force? Nobody thought that the Bush
Administration would be thinking in such ambitious terms, but plainly it
is, and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a few
months ago.Just before the 2000 election, a Republican foreign-policy figure suggested
to me that a good indication of a Bush Administration's direction in
foreign affairs would be who got a higher-ranking job, Paul Wolfowitz or
Richard Haass. Haass is another veteran of the first Bush Administration,
and an intellectual like Wolfowitz, but much more moderate. In 1997, he
published a book titled ""The Reluctant Sheriff,"" in which he poked a little
fun at Wolfowitz's famous strategy briefing of the early nineties (he
called it the ""Pentagon Paper"") and disagreed with its idea that the United
States should try to be the world's only great power over the long term.
""For better or worse, such a goal is beyond our reach,"" Haass wrote. ""It
simply is not doable."" Elsewhere in the book, he disagreed with another of
the Wolfowitz team's main ideas, that of the United States expanding the
""democratic zone of peace"": ""Primacy is not to be confused with hegemony.
The United States cannot compel others to become more democratic."" Haass
argued that the United States is becoming less dominant in the world, not
more, and suggested ""a revival of what might be called traditional
great-power politics.""Wolfowitz got a higher-ranking job than Haass: he is Deputy Secretary of
Defense, and Haass is Director of Policy Planning for the State Department-
in effect, Colin Powell's big-think guy. Recently, I went to see him in his
office at the State Department. On the wall of his waiting room was an
array of photographs of every past director of the policy-planning staff,
beginning with George Kennan, the father of the containment doctrine and
the first holder of the office that Haass now occupies.It's another indication of the way things are moving in Washington that
Haass seems to have become more hawkish. I mentioned the title of his book.
""Using the word 'reluctant' was itself reflective of a period when foreign
policy seemed secondary, and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard case
to make,"" he said. ""It was written when Bill Clinton was saying, 'It's the
economy, stupid'-not 'It's the world, stupid.' Two things are very
different now. One, the President has a much easier time making the case
that foreign policy matters. Second, at the top of the national-security
charts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.""I asked Haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad as
Kennan's containment. ""I think there is,"" he said. ""What you're seeing from
this Administration is the emergence of a new principle or body of
ideas-I'm not sure it constitutes a doctrine-about what you might call the
limits of sovereignty. Sovereignty entails obligations. One is not to
massacre your own people. Another is not to support terrorism in any way.
If a government fails to meet these obligations, then it forfeits some of
the normal advantages of sovereignty, including the right to be left alone
inside your own territory. Other governments, including the United States,
gain the right to intervene. In the case of terrorism, this can even lead
to a right of preventive, or peremptory, self-defense. You essentially can
act in anticipation if you have grounds to think it's a question of when,
and not if, you're going to be attacked.""Clearly, Haass was thinking of Iraq. ""I don't think the American public
needs a lot of persuading about the evil that is Saddam Hussein,"" he said.
""Also, I'd fully expect the President and his chief lieutenants to make the
case. Public opinion can be changed. We'd be able to make the case that
this isn't a discretionary action but one done in self-defense.""On the larger issue of the American role in the world, Haass was still
maintaining some distance from the hawks. He had made a speech not long
before called ""Imperial America,"" but he told me that there is a big
difference between imperial and imperialist. ""I just think that we have to
be a little bit careful,"" he said. ""Great as our advantages are, there are
still limits. We have to have allies. We can't impose our ideas on
everyone. We don't want to be fighting wars alone, so we need others to
join us. American leadership, yes; but not American unilateralism. It has
to be multilateral. We can't win the war against terror alone. We can't
send forces everywhere. It really does have to be a collaborative endeavor.""He stopped for a moment. ""Is there a successor idea to containment? I think
there is,"" he said. ""It is the idea of integration. The goal of U.S.
foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on to
certain key ideas as to how the world should operate: opposition to
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, support for free trade,
democracy, markets. Integration is about locking them into these policies
and then building institutions that lock them in even more.""The first, but by no means the last, obvious manifestation of a new
American foreign policy will be the effort to remove Saddam Hussein. What
the United States does in an Iraq operation will very likely dwarf what's
been done so far in Afghanistan, both in terms of the scale of the
operation itself and in terms of its aftermath.Several weeks ago, Ahmad Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress,
the Iraqi opposition party, came through Washington with an entourage of
his aides. Chalabi went to the State Department and the White House to ask,
evidently successfully, for more American funding. His main public event
was a panel discussion at the American Enterprise Institute. Chalabi's
leading supporter in town, Richard Perle, the prominent hawk and former
Defense Department official, acted as moderator. Smiling and supremely
confident, Perle opened the discussion by saying, ""Evidence is mounting
that the Administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealing
with Saddam Hussein."" The war on terrorism, he said, will not be complete
""until Saddam is successfully dealt with. And that means replacing his
regime. . . . That action will be taken, I have no doubt.""Chalabi, who lives in London, is a charming, suave middle-aged man with a
twinkle in his eye. He was dressed in a double-breasted pin-striped suit
and a striped shirt with a white spread collar. Although he and his
supporters argue that the Iraqi National Congress, with sufficient American
support, can defeat Saddam just as the Northern Alliance defeated the
Taliban in Afghanistan, this view hasn't won over most people in
Washington. It isn't just that Chalabi doesn't look the part of a rebel
military leader (""He could fight you for the last petit four on the tray
over tea at the Savoy, but that's about it,"" one skeptical former Pentagon
official told me), or that he isn't in Iraq. It's also that Saddam's
military is perhaps ten times the size that the Taliban's was, and has been
quite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade. The United
States left Iraq in 1991 believing that Saddam might soon fall to an
internal rebellion; Chalabi's supporters believe that Saddam is much weaker
now, and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing could
finish him off. But non-true believers seem to be coming around to the idea
that a military operation against Saddam would mean the deployment of
anywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand American ground
troops.Kenneth Pollack, a former C.I.A. analyst who was the National Security
Council's staff expert on Iraq during the last years of the Clinton
Administration, recently caused a stir in the foreign-policy world by
publishing an article in Foreign Affairs calling for war against Saddam.
This was noteworthy because three years ago Pollack and two co-authors
published an article, also in Foreign Affairs, arguing that the Iraqi
National Congress was incapable of defeating Saddam. Pollack still doesn't
think Chalabi can do the job. He believes that it would require a
substantial American ground, air, and sea force, closer in size to the one
we used in Kuwait in 1990-91 than to the one we are using now in
Afghanistan.Pollack, who is trim, quick, and crisp, is obviously a man who has given a
briefing or two in his day. When I went to see him at his office in
Washington, with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk and
walked over to his office wall, where three maps of the Middle East were
hanging. ""The only way to do it is a full-scale invasion,"" he said, using a
pen as a pointer. ""We're talking about two grand corps, two to three
hundred thousand people altogether. The population is here, in the
Tigris-Euphrates valley."" He pointed to the area between Baghdad and Basra.
""Ideally, you'd have the Saudis on board."" He pointed to the Prince Sultan
airbase, near Riyadh. ""You could make Kuwait the base, but it's much easier
in Saudi. You need to take western Iraq and southern Iraq""-pointing
again-""because otherwise they'll fire Scuds at Israel and at the Saudi oil
fields. You probably want to prevent Iraq from blowing up its own oil
fields, so troops have to occupy them. And you need troops to defend the
Kurds in northern Iraq."" Point, point. ""You go in as hard as you can, as
fast as you can."" He slapped his hand on the top of his desk. ""You get the
enemy to divide his forces, by threatening him in two places at once."" His
hand hit the desk again, hard. ""Then you crush him."" Smack.That would be a reverberating blow. The United States has already removed
the government of one country, Afghanistan, the new government is obviously
shaky, and American military operations there are not completed. Pakistan,
which before September 11th clearly met the new test of national
unacceptability (it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of mass
destruction), will also require long-term attention, since the country is
not wholly under the control of the government, as the murder of Daniel
Pearl demonstrated, and even parts of the government, like the intelligence
service, may not be entirely under the control of the President. In Iraq,
if America invades and brings down Saddam, a new government must be
established-an enormous long-term task in a country where there is no
obvious, plausible new leader. The prospective Iraq operation has drawn
strong objections from the neighboring nations, one of which, Russia, is a
nuclear superpower. An invasion would have a huge effect on the internal
affairs of all the biggest Middle Eastern nations: Iran, Turkey, Saudi
Arabia, and even Egypt. Events have forced the Administration to become
directly involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as it hadn't wanted
to do. So it's really the entire region that is in play, in much the way
that Europe was immediately after the Second World War.In September, Bush rejected Paul Wolfowitz's recommendation of immediate
moves against Iraq. That the President seems to have changed his mind is an
indication, in part, of the bureaucratic skill of the Administration's
conservatives. ""These guys are relentless,"" one former official, who is
close to the high command at the State Department, told me. ""Resistance is
futile."" The conservatives' other weapon, besides relentlessness, is
intellectualism. Colin Powell tends to think case by case, and since
September 11th the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at least
the beginning of a coherent, hawkish world view whose acceptance
practically requires invading Iraq. If the United States applies the
doctrines of Cheney's old Pentagon team, ""shaping"" and expanding ""the zone
of democracy,"" the implications would extend far beyond that one operation.The outside experts on the Middle East who have the most credibility with
the Administration seem to be Bernard Lewis, of Princeton, and Fouad Ajami,
of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, both of whom
see the Arab Middle East as a region in need of radical remediation. Lewis
was invited to the White House in December to brief the senior
foreign-policy staff. ""One point he made is, Look, in that part of the
world, nothing matters more than resolute will and force,"" the senior
official I had lunch with told me-in other words, the United States needn't
proceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the ""Arab street,"" as long as it is
prepared to be strong. The senior official also recommended as interesting
thinkers on the Middle East Charles Hill, of Yale, who in a recent essay
declared, ""Every regime of the Arab-Islamic world has proved a failure,""
and Reuel Marc Gerecht, of the American Enterprise Institute, who published
an article in The Weekly Standard about the need for a change of regime in
Iran and Syria. (Those goals, Gerecht told me when we spoke, could be
accomplished through pressure short of an invasion.)Several people I spoke with predicted that most, or even all, of the
nations that loudly oppose an invasion of Iraq would privately cheer it on,
if they felt certain that this time the Americans were really going to
finish the job. One purpose of Vice-President Cheney's recent diplomatic
tour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter, while gamely
absorbing all the public criticism of an Iraq operation. In any event, the
Administration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance of
the world's approval. When I spoke to Condoleezza Rice, she said that the
United States should assemble ""coalitions of the willing"" to support its
actions, rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructure
of international treaties and organizations. An invasion of Iraq would test
that policy in more ways than one: the Administration would be betting that
it can continue to eliminate Al Qaeda cells in countries that publicly
opposed the Iraq operation.When the Administration submitted its budget earlier this year, it asked
for a forty-eight-billion-dollar increase in defense spending for fiscal
2003, which begins in October, 2002. Much of that sum would go to improve
military pay and benefits, but ten billion dollars of it is designated as
an unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war on
terrorism. That's probably at least the initial funding for an invasion of
Iraq.This spring, the Administration will be talking to other countries about
the invasion, trying to secure basing and overflight privileges, while Bush
builds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about the
unacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction. A drama
involving weapons inspections in Iraq will play itself out over the spring
and summer, and will end with the United States declaring that the terms
that Saddam offers for the inspections, involving delays and restrictions,
are unacceptable. Then, probably in the late summer or early fall, the
enormous troop positioning, which will take months, will begin. The
Administration obviously feels confident that the United States can
effectively parry whatever aggressive actions Saddam takes during the troop
buildup, and hopes that its moves will destabilize Iraq enough to cause the
Republican Guard, the military key to the country, to turn against Saddam
and topple him on its own. But the chain of events leading inexorably to a
full-scale American invasion, if it hasn't already begun, evidently will
begin soon.Lewis (Scooter) Libby, who was the principal drafter of Cheney's
future-of-the-world documents during the first Bush Administration, now
works in an office in the Old Executive Office Building, overlooking the
West Wing, where he has a second, smaller office. A packet of
public-relations material prompted by the recent paperback publication of
his 1996 novel, ""The Apprentice,"" quotes the Times' calling him ""Dick
Cheney's Dick Cheney,"" which seems like an apt description: he appears
absolutely sure of himself, and, whether by coincidence or as a result of
the influence of his boss, speaks in a tough, confidential, gravelly
rumble. Like Condoleezza Rice and Bush himself, he gives the impression of
having calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstruction
which the Administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting for
those charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right, the only
truly prudent course.When I went to see Libby, not long ago, I asked him whether, before
September 11th, American policy toward terrorism should have been
different. He went to his desk and got out a large black loose-leaf binder,
filled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the Middle
East. He looked through it for a long minute, formulating his answer.""Let us stack it up,"" he said at last. ""Somalia, 1993; 1994, the discovery
of the Al Qaeda-related plot in the Philippines; 1993, the World Trade
Center, first bombing; 1993, the attempt to assassinate President Bush,
former President Bush, and the lack of response to that, the lack of a
serious response to that; 1995, the Riyadh bombing; 1996, the Khobar
bombing; 1998, the Kenyan embassy bombing and the Tanzanian embassy
bombing; 1999, the plot to launch millennium attacks; 2000, the bombing of
the Cole. Throughout this period, infractions on inspections by the Iraqis,
and eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime; and the
failure to respond significantly to Iraqi incursions in the Kurdish areas.
No one would say these challenges posed easy problems, but if you take that
long list and you ask, 'Did we respond in a way which discouraged people
from supporting terrorist activities, or activities clearly against our
interests? Did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouraged
further aggressions against U.S. interests?,' many observers conclude no,
and ask whether it was then easier for someone like Osama bin Laden to rise
up and say credibly, 'The Americans don't have the stomach to defend
themselves. They won't take casualties to defend their interests. They are
morally weak.' ""Libby insisted that the American response to September 11th has not been
standard or foreordained. ""Look at what the President has done in
Afghanistan,"" he said, ""and look at his speech to the joint session of
Congress""-meaning the State of the Union Message, in January. ""He made it
clear that it's an important area. He made it clear that we believe in
expanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world.
He made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests. And
he had the courage to identify those states which present a problem, and to
begin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there is
not a change of behavior on their part. Take the Afghan case, for example.
There are many other courses that the President could have taken. He could
have waited for juridical proof before we responded. He could have engaged
in long negotiations with the Taliban. He could have failed to seek a new
relationship with Pakistan, based on its past nuclear tests, or been so
afraid of weakening Pakistan that we didn't seek its help. This list could
go on to twice or three times the length I've mentioned so far. But,
instead, the President saw an opportunity to refashion relations while
standing up for our interests. The problem is complex, and we don't know
yet how it will end, but we have opened new prospects for relations not
only with Afghanistan, as important as it was as a threat, but with the
states of Central Asia, Pakistan, Russia, and, as it may develop, with the
states of Southwest Asia more generally.""We moved on to Iraq, and the question of what makes Saddam Hussein
unacceptable, in the Administration's eyes. ""The issue is not inspections,""
Libby said. ""The issue is the Iraqis' promise not to have weapons of mass
destruction, their promise to recognize the boundaries of Kuwait, their
promise not to threaten other countries, and other promises that they made
in '91, and a number of U.N. resolutions, including all the other problems
I listed. Whether it was wise or not-and that is the subject of debate-Iraq
was given a second chance to abide by international norms. It failed to
take that chance then, and annually for the next ten years.""""What's your level of confidence,"" I asked him, ""that the current regime
will, in fact, change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by?""He ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spoke
slowly and deliberately. ""There is no basis in Iraq's past behavior to have
confidence in good-faith efforts on their part to change their behavior.""--

"" ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ( i live in a little hsiang just behind the school - - "" hsiang "" being the chinese for a little alley connected to a main street ) . and having to apologize and reexplain . . . but i mainly switch between the languages , and there is little chance i create my own pidgin or creole . . . so do many taiwanese ( min-nan ) speaking people in the south of the island . . . so does it not mean that the evolution should depend on the education level of people - so that it would be differential inside a society according to , say , the social class ? there is probably as well a "" critical mass effect "" ( if france was turned into some chinese-dominant state . . . ) . is not our idea of "" homogeneity "" in evolution vitiated by the pretention of modern nation-states to generate a "" super-culture "" - through linguistic homogeneisation ? ) - i am also aware of phenomenons of resistance to acculturative evolution ( conscious or not ) as for the quebecquois telling , not "" un hot-dog "" as the french do , but "" un chien chaud "" ( toubon being in my opinion but a marginal impedement on the natural evolution , whatever direction it takes ) . . . - another exemple of the complexity of those issue would be the "" rigidification "" of a language facing a threat . it was given to me as an explanation when i was a student of kurdish , when i learnt that this language has in common with old persian an "" ergative "" ( ? ) construction for transitive verbs in past tenses , which was presented to me as a "" quite - passive "" construction . to allow for comparisons by more knowledgeable people , i will explain a little : there , the infix representing the agent is appended at the end of the verb , while the infix representing the subject is appended after the object , as : mindal-eke sew - ek - y xuward - 0 ( - eke and ek ( [ ^ e ] k ) being suffixes expressing definiteness ( eke = the ) ( child-the apple-one - he ate ) and indefiniteness respectively ( ek = a ) ) here , - y represents the child , - 0 a null infix ( there is only one apple ) , so "" the child ate the apples "" would be : mindal-eke sew - ek - y xiward-n < - - - - "" - n "" : there are several apples ( child-the apples-the - he ate-them ) so i was told at this time that this construct , which was used in old persian ( and is still used in the variety of persian spoken in afghanistan , is an archaic construction , characteristic of the periphery of the indo-iranian domain , that is , in kurdistan ( south-kurmandji , or sorani-speaking part ) , and also among the baluches , and represents a rigidification of the language due to a threat from other languages , ( so that languages at a domain periphery would sometimes evolve more slowly ) and that it has disappeared from standard modern persian . . . i would want to know if all that is still considered true , though . what do you think of it ? i guess there are as well different levels of evolution taking place simultaneously , that can be contradictory ( phonology , vocabulary , syntax . . . ) . anyway , i see several reasons why it should be difficult to infer any "" linear "" evolution of languages ( whatever fascination i feel when i read posts speaking of modelisations of 10 or 20 000 years back . . . ) on anything else that a case-by - case basis ( or does the fact that populations densities has obviously undergone a dramatic change since then , changing the dynamics of contacts . . . ? ? ? ? ) . to resume my questions : how can we ascertain that this language has had this reaction without having to resort to extra-linguistic implicit hypothesis as : homogeneity through classes , identity of evolution whatever the number of speakers would be ( lng-switching vs creolisation . . . ) , existence ( or not ) , type , and evolution of a scripting system ( * * ) etc . . . ? as i told , i am no linguist , ( neither "" linguistician "" nor philologist : ) , so i hope i did not waste your time , thus getting all your community angry at me ( ack ! - terrible perspective ) . but i will be very interested to read more about all this . friendly to all , gerard gautier ( * * ) once more , kurdish would be a good case in point , as it uses up to three different scripting systems according to the place ( latin , arabo-persian , cyrillic for the north-kurmandji , and latin and arabo-persian for sorani ) ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ wen-tzao school | \ | / / gerard gautier of foreign languages | / \ \ | . . \ | \ | | _ _ > | _ / \ _ > o _ _ _ > kaohsiung - taiwan _ / _ / . . _ / ( _ s . . _ / gauier @ cc . nsysu . edu . tw ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~",Safe Email

Alberta, and to a lesser extent some of the other Western provinces, is
definitely not happy with the current arrangement.  Some of this has to
do with the strange way the Canadian government is structured.  When I
was last up in Alberta (a month ago), the newspapers were reporting
something like 70% of Albertans favor separating from Canada, and over
several distinct issues.The problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhouse
that is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces, their
interests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government in
Ottawa.  While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars to
Ottawa per capita of the average Canadian, they only have token
representation in the federal government.  While I'm not clear on
exactly how the government works up there, representation is not
entirely based on population, and it works out that some eastern
provinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone have
substantially more representatives in the legislature than the entire
province of Alberta.  The long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Alberta
as a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even so
much as throwing Alberta a bone, and are able to do so because even the
sparsely populated eastern provinces can out-vote Alberta despite having
fewer people.  Or something like that.  The Canadian government is less
restricted than the US government, so they can do strange things, like
having restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces,
Alberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities.  It is
essentially a much worse version of what is happening in the
inter-mountain West of the US.  Unlike the US case though, the rest of
Canada would really be hurting if they weren't receiving all those tax
dollars from Alberta.  OTOH, Alberta would probably thrive.I have friends in Alberta, and visit occasionally, but I'm not totally
clear on everything that goes on in that country, due to my partial
unfamiliarity with how the government works up there, so I'm a little
fuzzy on some of the details.  What I do know is that on average the
Albertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada and
the sentiment has been getting worse over the years.Cheers,-James Rogers

did you fail to grok?  I personally doubt it simply because I never
heard of Bush and Chirac going to Brighton.Next time I hear a joke, I promise not to laugh until I have checked

//-->Type here and click go.July 18, 2002 Dear Readers,
I'm sure you've seen those annoying X-10 cameras ads popping up left and right while surfing the Internet. One day, out of curiosity, I decided to check this bothersome company's Web site. To my amazement, I found that their miniature cameras are pretty darn tiny, and you can mount them practically anywhere. But what does the law says about using them? I wouldn't want anyone to invade my privacy with that sort of camera setup. Coincidentally, I ran across this interesting discussion about this in the Boards, where members were discussing these miniature cameras, called CCTVs, and the privacy concerns around them. So if you want more info or would like to leave your two cents' worth about this, send us a post. Besides, this information might keep you from getting caught on camera in an embarrassing situation.

"phonemicity of writing i would like to get some estimate of what percentage of the world 's written languages are represented orthographically in a phonemic manner . more specifically , how many written languages are such that one can predict the phonological properties of a word - - - including stress , accent or tone - - - merely by consulting the string of symbols used to write that word , and without further information , such as the morphological structure of the word ? for a language whose writing system is largely phonemic , one could write down a set of rules for word pronunciation , and in the ideal case the number of rules would be within an order of magnitude of the number of graphemes . ( a few lexical exceptions do n't matter , as long as there are n't hundreds of them . ) i am leaving the sense of ` phoneme ' intentionally vague : normally a phonemic written representation implies that one can predict the surface phonemic representation from the written form of the word , but i would be perfectly happy considering a system to be phonemic if some more abstract level of phonological representation were represented , from which the surface phonemic representation could be predicted by regular phonological rules / principles . ( i should also note , to clarify the question further , that i am interested primarily in the correspondence between the written form and the spoken form for the the standard variet ( y , ies ) of the language , which the written form presumably reflects to some degree : i am not interested ( at the moment ) in dialects of the language which deviate to varying degrees from the standard . ) so , under this definition , spanish would presumably count as very phonemic since one can nearly always predict the pronunciation of a word , including its stress , from the orthography . romanian is less phonemic since while the actual set of phonemes in a word is mostly determinable by the set of graphemes used ( with the representation of glides being slight source of complication ) , the placement of stress requires some knowledge of the morphological class of the word ( following work of ioana chitoran ) . english is presumably among the least phonemic , since the ` regular rules ' of pronunciation are themselves quite complex , and there are many lexical exceptions . the particular classification of the writing system as logographic , moraic or segmental is unimportant : in principle chinese writing could be classed as phonemic ( albeit with a rather large set of graphemes ) , but for the fact that especially among the more common characters there are quite a few with pronunciation ambiguities which can only be resolved using lexical information . i am familiar with several of the recent books on writing systems : but while these typically contain in-depth analyses of particular systems , as far as i can tell , nobody has done a survey of this kind . ( if on the contrary , someone can point me to a survey that answers this question , i would be most grateful . ) so , i would be very interested in getting as much information related to this question on as many languages as people are sufficiently familiar with . i think i already know the answer to these questions for the more familiar western european languages ( including some less familiar ones like irish and welsh ) , as well as romanian , russian , hebrew , arabic , chinese , japanese and malagasy . i would be particularly interested in knowing about languages for which writing systems have only recently been developed , or for which the spelling system has recently undergone a massive restructuring : conventional wisdom has it that in such cases the writing system should be very phonemic , but perhaps that is not always true . please send any replies to me , and if there are a sufficient number i will post the results of this survey to the list . - richard sproat linguistics research department at&t bell laboratories | tel ( 908 ) 582-5296 600 mountain avenue , room 2d - 451 | fax ( 908 ) 582-7308 murray hill , nj 07974 , usa | rws @ research . att . com",Safe Email

"Dear friend,
May I briefly introduce myself to you. I am Hajia Maryam Abacha, the wife of late Nigerian Head of State, General Sanni Abacha, who died on the 8th of June 1998. ever since the death of my husband, my family has been facing a lot of problems mostly with the present civilian government. Consequently, my son - Mohammed Abacha has been under torture in detention for a sin he did not commit and made to make a lot of confessions as regards valuables and money, including that of my late husband entrusted in his hand for safe keeping. 
The latest is the confession of the US$700,000,000.00 (Seven Hundred Million United States Dollars) cash his late father gave him for safe keeping. Please check News watch Magazine of May 8th / 15th, 2000 issue on [Website:http://www.newswatchngr.com] to confirm the above story. Also the recent publication by this day Newspaper on Thursday March 1st Edition, which London Court clear ways for more recovery of Abacha's family looted money. Please confirm this issue on website; http://www.thisdayonline.com, click the Archieve/2001/March 2001/Thursday March 1st.
On this note, I deposited a total sum of US$40,300,000.00 (Forty Million, three hundred thousand United states Dollars) sometimes March last year with a security company abroad (name withheld for now). Normally, we (1 and Mohammed Abacha) usually do such transactions, by first sending the money out by cargo to security company outside Nigeria, as photographic materials.
And thereafter go to the security company for claims before transferring it to any bank of our choice. Presently, I cannot travel out of Nigeria, because, if you have gone through the above mentioned website address, you will see how my son's confessions had implicated my husband and in fact the whole of my family. This has actually caused the federal Government of Nigeria to confiscate our International passports, frozen every of my family member's bank accounts, both home and abroad, even our properties. 
My problem now is, I want someone that can assist me move the US$40,300,000.00 (Forty Million Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) out from the Security Company and move the money to your country.
I shall be ready to negotiate with you any percentage you might want from the sum. On your advice I shall be ready to invest my own share of the sum in your country. I assure you that there will be no problems at all in the course of moving out the money. Please kindly contact me on my e-mail:mrsabacha_11@mail.com or FAX 234-1-7590893, I shall so much appreciate your immediate response for full details of the business which shall be given to you by my second son Mallam Mustafa Abacha. You should note also that my son - Mallam Mustapha Abacha shall handle all cases as regards this business; as he is well abreast with this transaction for I do not have access to telephone lines now because they have been tossed by security agents and my movement is being monitored. I would like my son (Mallam Mustafa Abacha) to settle down  or be involved in a dating relationship with any lucky foreign lady at the successful completion of the transaction.
In acknowledgement of my proposal, I would want you to furnish me with your telephone number, fax number and address so as to enable my son whom will be dealing with you directly to easily have you communicate as to how you will receive this money on our behalf risk-free.
Thanking you in anticipation to your kind understanding and cooperation. I am looking forward for a healthy business relationship with you  and my entire household.

"workshop on embedded mt systems ( call for papers ) * * * * * * * * * deadline extension announcement * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * new submission deadline : august 24 , 1998 workshop announcement - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - workshop on embedded mt systems call for papers design , construction , and evaluation of systems with an mt component wednesday , october 28 , 1998 ( preceding the amta 98 conference ) sheraton bucks county hotel , langhorne , pennsylvania introduction as the strengths and weaknesses of machine translation ( mt ) engines have become better understood and accepted , there has been a marked increase in the development of computer systems with an embedded mt component . one consequence of this shift to "" embedded mt "" is that researchers , developers , as well as users have begun pushing the limits on the input that such systems will accept for translation . in so doing , a new class of problems has surfaced : any input - - - whether it appears in physical form on paper , in electronic form on-line , or mixed in with another modality such as graphics or video - - - will bring with it some unknown mix of noisy natural language data as well as non-linguistic data . how are systems with an mt component to be designed and evaluated given the challenge this input brings ? the objective of this workshop is to examine and evaluate techniques for adjusting this "" linguistic impedance mismatch "" between the real-world input and the natural language input expected by various mt engines . thus the workshop will focus on computational approaches to preprocessing system input for mt engines and on statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component . linguistic preprocessing in image data for researchers working with image data , there is currently underway an effort to augment ocr ( optical character recognition ) engines with linguistic data as they recognize and convert bitmap data into characters - - - similar to what has already been done in speech recognition with linguistic data in hmms ( hidden markov models ) . other ocr researchers have also experimented with image-level early topic detection using word-shape recognition . in principle , this could provide a first-step filtering of documents into a more homogeneous mt input set , a desirable goal for mt evaluation . thus we expect that individuals working with or intending to incorporate ocr into their computer systems will be interested in this new area . linguistic preprocessing in online data for those working with online input , even though the characters are already present , there often still remains the task of preprocessing meaningful , symbolic character strings that are not a part of the text to be translated . for some systems , the rules for identifying and encapsulating or removing such strings may need to be hand-crafted over time as mt engine limitations surface . for others , a combination of hand-crafted rules and statistically trained nl models has worked . many have observed that the html annotations , alphanumeric items , spreadsheet and word processing codes are harder to weed out than originally expected . research efforts with the low-density and less-commonly taught languages , as well as more common ones , encounter a substantial problem with variation in spelling conventions and transcription preferences . for those natural languages that are primarily spoken and not written , for example , this is frequently the case . researchers working on this class of problem have built variants on spell checkers ( sc ) , components that standardize words to one orthography ( spelling convention ) before submitting it to an mt engine . an idea that has arisen for this component is to build in an option to adjust the level of sc correction - - - as would be relevant when input after ocr nonetheless varies from very noisy to relatively clean . evaluation of embedded mt systems among those working on statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component , we have seen two distinct trends . one group of statisticians has begun looking for appropriate models from outside the world of mt evaluation , examining the efforts by others to take distinct metrics for components and combine them for an overall system-level metric using fuzzy mathematics . another group of researchers is looking instead at developing a one-dimensional scale for ranking mt engines along a continuum defined by system-level function . that approach , for example , might rank one engine as good enough for filtering documents , while another engine deemed more linguistically robust would be ranked higher because it could generate a good enough initial translation for subsequent post-editing . we welcome other functional evaluations of mt components and computer systems with embedded mt components as well . submissions submitters are invited to send in a short paper , not more than 5 pages , addressing one or more of the three areas discussed above . papers should define the problem in an embedded mt system that is the focus of the work , describe the embedded mt system design ( a simple sketch ) with sample input data where relevant , and present their approach to the problem . work at various stages of completion is acceptable ; we expect the current status of the work to be made clear . submission of end-to - end output of an embedded mt system is especially encouraged . the papers will be collected and distributed to participants of the workshop . ideally , the result of the workshop will be a clearer delineation of : ( 1 ) the range of linguistic preprocessing problems ( 2 ) the range of designs in embedded mt systems ( 3 ) how these problems are treated in different embedded mt systems ( 4 ) the metrics that are being used to evaluate these systems and their components . dates notice of interest in participation : july 10 , 1998 ( to voss @ arl . mil ) please identify which of the three areas you intend to address : preprocessing in image data , preprocessing in online data , evaluation of embedded mt systems . position paper submission : august 10 , 1998 note : now , august 24 , 1998 notifications : september 10 , 1998 note : now , september 17 , 1998 final copies of papers : october 10 , 1998 workshop : october 28 , 1998 submissions may be in printed or electronic form . submissions should be sent to : clare voss army research laboratory amsrl-is -

( nor has it explained the extensive use of star wars - related names by the related - party companies . ) it ' s not immediately clear what es power 3 is or does . so far , subpoenas issued by lawyers suing enron have determined the names of senior officers of es power 3 and its formation date , january 1999 . among es power 3 ' s senior executives are enron ceo ken lay , listed as a director , and mcmahon and fastow , listed as executive vice presidents . a raft of external directors are named as es power 3 directors , including comdisco ceo norman blake and ronnie chan , chairman of the hong kong - based hang lung group . a comdisco spokeswoman says blake isn ' t commenting on matters concerning enron and a call to the hang lung group wasn ' t immediately returned . demands , demands rating agencies moody ' s , fitch and s & p recently put enron ' s credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an ljm deal that led to the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity . enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade . but its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade , or junk , bonds , suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely . if enron ' s rating drops below investment grade , it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $ 3 . 4 billion in off - balance sheet obligations . in addition , many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade . friday , the company drew down $ 3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations . raising cash in the cp market could be tough when investors are jittery about enron ' s condition . this week , a number of energy market players reduced exposure to enron . however , in a friday press release , ceo lay said that enron was the "" market - maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets .

"" peter eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling enron ' s adventures for some time . if you ' d listened to him earlier this year , you ' d have profited from his knowledge . his reporting on enron ' s partnership shenanigans to the departure of chief financial officer andrew fastow has been outstanding . the rumors - - from a pending bankruptcy to a justice department investigation - - are , for now , just that . and , enron did not single - handedly cause the california power crisis , nor is royal dutch / shell ( rd : nyse - news - commentary ) about to make a bid to buy the company . sources do tell me that head - count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business . and , while former ceo jeff skilling shares culpability for the current mess , his departure appears only indirectly related to enron ' s current woes . now , enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and , more importantly , its reputation . the company ' s challenge but what does enron do now ? it ' s very simple . come clean , clean up the mess and refocus on its core business : wholesale energy markets , risk management and retail energy services . they support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks . "" our gut feel is that enron can pull it off , and long - term investors should hold firm , as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings , with upside potential to $ 25 per share over the next 12 - 18 months , "" says jeff dietert , power analyst at simmons & co . and a member of the tsc energy roundtable . "" we believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery . "" dietert outlines four challenges for enron . one , management must regain the street ' s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance - sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow . two , enron must maintain its investment - grade credit rating . three , enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans . four , enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write - down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book . straightforward ? yes . easy to accomplish ? no . although enron says additional write - downs are unlikely - - except a $ 200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change - - analysts aren ' t so sure . they ' re focused on the company ' s global assets portfolio , sporting $ 6 billion in book value but generating an ebit ( earnings before interest and taxes ) loss of $ 18 million over the past 12 months . the divestitures include $ 390 million in exploration and production assets in india , $ 250 million in a puerto rico power plant and $ 250 million in a brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of portland general , which is set to close in 2002 . there will likely be others . however , enron has to execute here , and given the current state of its affairs , the seller will feel the pressure . the credit - rating issue is a fine line . the current ratings , bbb + from standard & poor ' s and baal from moody ' s , are three levels above non - investment grade . however , both rating agencies now have enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades . dietert estimates that enron ' s debt - to - market cap will be about 48 % by year - end , and the company has interest coverage ( ebitda / interest expense ) of about 3 . 5 times . by comparison , the average s the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades ; potentially lower credit ratings force counter - parties to reduce exposure to enron , limiting enron ' s ability to generate earnings and cash flow . "" it ' s time for enron to grow up . despite a lot of uncertainties and risk , i think it will . investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy . it ' s a tough call that requires strict , individual discipline . there ' s an irony to this whole story , especially in enron ' s lack of candor in reporting its financial results . in a much - lauded advertising campaign , enron , looking to challenge conventional wisdom , asks the simple question , "" why ? ask why . "" investors are now asking . it ' s time for ken lay to answer . first things first many readers have asked about my relative quietness this week . thank you for your concern . my father has fallen ill after fighting the effects of a brain tumor for more than a decade . the choice was easy . i ' m with him and my family . enjoy your weekend with family and friends . dj enron unit , new england market downplay report of default 2001 - 10 - 26 17 : 14 ( new york ) by kristen mcnamara of dow jones newswires new york ( dow jones ) - - enron corp .

"" i can state with considerable confidence that there have been other participants "" that have defaulted on their credit agreements , "" and it ' s never been in the news , "" said david doot , secretary and general counsel for the new england power pool , which developed the policies governing the region ' s electricity market . "" my instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of proportion . "" news of the enron unit ' s default appeared in a trade publication and a major metropolitan newspaper this week , as enron ' s dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company ' s stock and bond prices . enron energy services never received word that it had defaulted on its bonding requirement twice before , because both times it corrected the problem within a day , spokeswoman peggy mahoney said . the letter sent by iso new england , which operates the region ' s power market , to notify the enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong person , delaying the company ' s response , mahoney said . "" clearly , it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit , "" mahoney said . the company resolved the problem by oct . 19 , mahoney said . iso new england spokeswoman ellen foley confirmed friday that the company had cured its default . it ' s rare for a company to default three times , but it has happened on occasion , foley and doot said . "" i won ' t say it ' s commonplace , but i won ' t say it ' s unusual for a participant to find itself out of compliance , "" doot said . "" those things have in fact happened from time to time .

' ' enron ' s palmer said he didn ' t know the status of the attorney general ' s investigation . ` ` i think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman , ' ' palmer said . more lawsuits enron , along with other major power providers such as duke energy corp . and dynegy inc . , face at least five lawsuits alleging they manipulated california energy prices in violation of antitrust laws . the cases , which include separate complaints filed by the city of san francisco , california lieutenant governor cruz bustamante and various consumers , currently are in state courts awaiting a coordination proceeding , said michael aguirre , a lawyer representing bustamante . the lawsuits should be assigned to a judge by the end of next month , he said . if the complaints succeed , the companies might be ordered to repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines , including triple damages . enron ' s stock fell 95 cents , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 15 . 40 , declining for the eighth day in a row . the shares have fallen 80 percent in the past 12 months . - - daniel taub in los angeles , ( 323 ) 801 - 1261 or enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 5 ) 2001 - 10 - 26 16 : 18 ( new york ) enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 5 ) ( adds investor comment in fourth paragraph . ) houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $ 3 billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low - interest , short - term loans . the company ' s stock has fallen 54 percent in the past 14 days after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by enron ' s former chief financial officer . the shares fell 95 cents , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 15 . 40 today . chief executive officer kenneth lay has failed to reassure investors that the company ' s credit rating won ' t be cut , investors said . enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets , where short - term loans carry lower rates than banks offer . ` ` do they have the financial flexibility they once had ? no , ' ' said john cassady , who helps manage $ 3 billion in bonds at fifth third bancorp . ` ` people are questioning the credibility of management . ' ' the company will use its credit line to pay off $ 2 . 2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding , enron spokesman mark palmer said . bonds drop enron ' s 6 3 / 4 percent bonds , which mature in 2009 , declined 1 1 / 2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents . at that price , the bonds , which carry a rating of ` ` bbb + , ' ' yield 9 . 53 percent . investors have grown concerned that the company ' s credit rating will be cut after $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses from failed investments . enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions . enron ' s decision to tap its credit line was ` ` a smart financial move , ' ' said stephen moore , a vice president at moody ' s investors service who follows the company . ` ` it took away the hassle and time - consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital . ' ' though enron ' s bonds have investment - grade ratings , their yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds that carry junk ratings . according to bloomberg data , companies with ` ` bb ' ' ratings pay on average 9 . 16 percent to borrow for seven years . a lower credit rating may also force enron to buy back holdings in other partnerships with its stock , diluting the value of enron investors ' stock . partnerships called whitewing , marlin and yosemite own enron assets they bought with borrowed money . enron sold the assets to the partnerships to keep related debt off its books . the partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the assets . other liabilities if enron loses investment - grade rating , the borrowed money comes due earlier , leaving less time for the partnerships to find the best price for the power plants and other assets . enron would have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell for and the amount of the debt . one way would be issuing common shares to exchange for enron preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships . that would thin out the holdings of every other investor . of the two main bond - rating companies , moody ' s and fitch have enron on watch for possible downgrade , and standard & poor ' s lowered enron ' s long - term credit outlook to negative . egan - jones rating co . today lowered its rating on enron ' s debt to ` ` bb + , ' ' one notch below investment grade , from ` ` bbb - . ' ' enron ' s liabilities associated with the partnerships amount to at least $ 3 . 3 billion , the company has said . enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow on wednesday amid a securities and exchange commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost the company $ 35 million in direct losses . enron also bought back 62 million shares from the partnership , reducing shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion . ` ` it looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the benefit of himself , ' ' fifth third ' s cassady said . jeff mcmahon , head of enron ' s industrial markets group , was named cfo in a bid to restore investor confidence , lay said in a statement . - - russell hubbard in the princeton newsroom at 609 - 750 - 4651 , or at keller rohrback l . l . p . investigates potential claims on behalf of enron corp . - - ene - - employees and former employees 10 / 26 / 2001 business wire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire ) seattle - - ( business wire ) - - oct . 26 , 2001 - - seattle ' s keller rohrback l . l . p . is currently investigating potential erisa claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of enron ' s retirement and 401 ( k ) plans . the investigation period covers january 2000 through october 2001 . the investigation focuses on concerns that , under the law interpreting erisa , enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a plan investment . rather than providing complete and accurate information to the plans ' participants , it may be alleged that enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information , thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the plans . this investigation is being conducted in light of recent events . on oct . 16 , 2001 , enron surprised the market when it announced that the company was taking "" non - recurring charges totaling $ 1 . 01 billion after - tax , or ( $ 1 . 11 ) loss per diluted share , "" in the third quarter of 2001 . enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships , controlled by enron ' s cfo , and that the company would be eliminating more than $ 1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments . as this news began to be assimilated by the market , the price of enron common stock dropped significantly . in addition , several recently filed securities suits allege that enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading , gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds . enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets . if you are a member of an enron retirement plan , wish to discuss this announcement , or have information relevant to the investigation , you may contact paralegal liza catabay , or any member of our team ( britt tinglum , liza catabay , or lynn sarko ) toll free at 800 / 776 - 6044 , or via e - mail at investor @ kellerrohrback . com . seattle ' s keller rohrback l . l . p . has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade . its trial lawyers have obtained judgments and settlements on behalf of clients in excess of seven billion dollars . contact : keller rohrback l . l . p . liza catabay , 800 / 776 - 6044 investor @ kellerrohrback . com www . seattleclassaction . com 15 : 16 edt october 26 , 2001 copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .",Safe Email

My typical Java-to-C conversion doesn't increase the lines of code by
more than 20%, and a fair portion of that is the implementation of
additional features that drove us to do the conversion in the first
place.  Some things are substantially more succinct when written in C
than in Java.  C and most other mature languages have an endless
collection of libraries.  I personally don't use anything beyond the
core libraries of any language that much though.On a tangent, I find libraries nearly useless for a great many things
due primarily to the fact that most of them are so general that a given
non-trivial API almost always has a context in which it will function in
a pathological manner.  Code reuse is wonderful and all that, but
libraries frequently make design trade-offs that won't work for me even
if they theoretically do exactly what I need.  Unfortunately, it isn't
particularly easy nor does it make a nice simple API to design a library
that really is optimizable to a wide range of design cases.  I've built
a small collection of flexible psuedo-polymorphic APIs over the years
that I tend to use, but it is a pretty ugly solution for code reuse when
you get right down to it.

In the Beginning ...July 23, 2002
By DENNIS OVERBYE 
 It has always been easy to make fun of cosmologists,
confined to a dust mote lost in space, pronouncing judgment
on the fate of the universe or the behavior of galaxies
billions of light-years away, with only a few scraps of
light as evidence. ""Cosmologists are often wrong,"" the Russian physicist Lev
Landau put it, ""but never in doubt."" For most of the 20th century, cosmology seemed less a
science than a religious war over, say, whether the
universe had a beginning, in a fiery Big Bang billions of
years ago, or whether it exists eternally in the so-called
Steady State. In the last few years, however, a funny thing has happened.
Cosmologists are beginning to agree with one another.
Blessed with new instruments like the Hubble Space
Telescope and other space-based observatories, a new
generation of their giant cousins on the ground and
ever-faster computer networks, cosmology is entering ""a
golden age"" in which data are finally outrunning
speculation. ""The rate at which we are learning and discovering new
things is just extraordinary,"" said Dr. Charles Bennett, an
astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
Md. As a result, cosmologists are beginning to converge on what
they call a ""standard model"" of the universe that is
towering in its ambition. It purports to trace, at least in
broad strokes, cosmic history from the millisecond after
time began, when the universe was a boiling stew of energy
and subatomic particles, through the formation of atoms,
stars, galaxies and planets to the vast, dilute, dark
future in which all of these will have died. The universe, the cosmologists say, was born 14 billion
years ago in the Big Bang. Most of its material remains
resides in huge clouds of invisible so-called dark matter,
perhaps elementary particles left over from the primordial
explosion and not yet identified. Within these invisible clouds, the glittery lights in the
sky that have defined creation for generations of humans
are swamped, like flecks of foam on a rolling sea. A good
case can be made, scientists now agree, that the universe
will go on expanding forever. In fact, recent observations have suggested that the
expansion of the universe is speeding up over cosmic time,
under the influence of a ""dark energy"" even more mysterious
than dark matter. Recently, a group of astronomers led by Dr. William
Percival at the University of Edinburgh combined data from
a variety of observations to compile, based on the simplest
theoretical model, what they say is the most precise
enumeration yet of the parameters that cosmologists have
been fighting about for all these decades. The universe, they calculated, is 13.89 billion years old,
plus or minus half a billion years. Only 4.8 percent of it
is made of ordinary matter. Matter of all types, known and
unknown, luminous and dark, accounts for just 27.5 percent.
The rest of creation, 72.5 percent, is the mysterious dark
energy, they reported in a paper submitted last month to
The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. It is a picture that in some ways is surprisingly simple,
satisfying long-held theoretical prejudices about how the
universe should be designed. Continued agreement with
coming experiments may mean that science is approaching the
end of a ""great program"" of cosmological tests that began
in the 1930's, Dr. P. J. E. Peebles of Princeton and Dr.
Bharat Ratra of Kansas State University said in the draft
of a coming article for The Reviews of Modern Physics. In other ways this new dark universe is utterly baffling, a
road map to new mysteries. Dr. Marc Davis, a cosmologist at
the University of California at Berkeley, called it ""a
universe chock full of exotics that don't make sense to
anybody."" Moreover there are some questions that scientists still do
not know how to ask, let alone answer, scientifically. Was
there anything before the Big Bang? Is there a role for
life in the cosmos? Why is there something rather than
nothing at all? Will we ever know? ""We know much, but we still understand very little,"" said
Dr. Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of
Chicago. The Big Question Expanding Forever, 
Or Big Crunch? The dim caves of Lascaux, the plains of
Stonehenge and the dreamtime tales of Australian aborigines
all testify to the need to explain the world and existence.
This quest took its present form in 1917. That was when
Albert Einstein took his new general theory of relativity,
which explained how matter and energy warp space-time to
produce gravity, and applied it to the universe. Einstein discovered that the cosmos as his theory described
it would be unstable, prone to collapse under its own
gravity. Astronomers, however, were sure that the universe
was stable. So Einstein added a fudge factor that he called
the cosmological constant to his equations. It acted as a
long-range repulsive force to counterbalance gravity. In 1929, the astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the
universe was expanding. The sky was full of distant
galaxies all rushing away from us and one another, as if
propelled by what the British astronomer Dr. Fred Hoyle
later called derisively a ""big bang."" The universe was not
stable and, thus, did not require counterbalancing.
Einstein abandoned his constant, referring to it as his
biggest blunder. But it would return to haunt cosmologists,
and the universe. Hoyle's term stuck, and the notion of an explosive genesis
became orthodoxy in 1965, when Dr. Arno Penzias and Dr.
Robert Wilson, radio astronomers at Bell Laboratories,
discovered a faint uniform radio glow that pervaded the
sky. It was, cosmologists concluded, the fading remnant of
the primordial fireball itself. Relieved of their fudge factor, the equations describing
Einstein's universe were simple. Dr. Allan Sandage, the
Carnegie Observatories astronomer, once called cosmology
""the search for two numbers"" - one, the Hubble constant,
telling how fast the universe is expanding, and the other
telling how fast the expansion is slowing, and thus whether
the universe will expand forever or not. The second number, known as the deceleration parameter,
indicated how much the cosmos had been warped by the
density of its contents. In a high-density universe, space
would be curved around on itself like a ball. Such a
universe would eventually stop expanding and fall back
together in a big crunch that would extinguish space and
time, as well as the galaxies and stars that inhabit them.
A low-density universe, on the other hand, would have an
opposite or ""open"" curvature like a saddle, harder to
envision, and would expand forever. In between with no overall warpage at all was a
""Goldilocks"" universe with just the right density to expand
forever but more and more slowly, so that after an infinite
time it would coast to a stop. This was a ""flat"" universe
in the cosmological parlance, and to many theorists the
simplest and most mathematically beautiful solution of all.
But the sky did not yield those cosmic numbers easily, even
with the help of the 200-inch Hale telescope on Palomar
Mountain in Southern California, dedicated in 1948, which
had been built largely for that task. Dr. Hubble wrote of
measuring shadows and searching ""among ghostly errors of
measurement for landmarks that are scarcely more
substantial."" The Dark Side Invisible Matter 
Molds Galaxies 
It was not till the mid-70's, a
quarter-century after the Palomar giant began operating,
that groups of astronomers reached the tentative conclusion
that the universe they could see - stars, gas, planets and
galaxies - did not have nearly enough gravitational oomph
to stop the cosmic expansion. ""So the universe will continue to expand forever and
galaxies will get farther and farther apart, and things
will just die,"" Dr. Sandage said at the time. But the Great Argument was just beginning. Apparently there
was a lot of the universe that astronomers could not see.
The stars and galaxies, were moving as if immersed in the
gravity of giant invisible clouds of so-called dark matter
- ""missing matter"" the Swiss astronomer Dr. Fritz Zwicky
labeled it in the 1930's. Many galaxies, for example, are rotating so fast that they
would fly apart unless they were being reined in by the
gravity of halos of dark matter, according to pioneering
observations by Dr. Vera Rubin of the Carnegie Institution
of Washington and her colleagues. Her measurements
indicated that these dark halos outweighed the visible
galaxies themselves from 5 to 10 times. But there could be
even more dark matter farther out in space, perhaps enough
to stop the expansion of the universe, eventually, some
theorists suggested. Luminous matter, the Darth Vaders of
the sky said, is like the snow on mountaintops. But what is the dark matter? While some of it is gas or
dark dim objects like stars and planets, cosmologists
speculate that most of it is subatomic particles left over
from the Big Bang. Many varieties of these particles are predicted by theories
of high-energy physics. But their existence has not been
confirmed or detected in particle accelerators. ""We theorists can invent all sorts of garbage to fill the
universe,"" Dr. Sheldon Glashow, a Harvard physicist and
Nobel laureate, told a gathering on dark matter in 1981. Collectively known as WIMP's, for weakly interacting
massive particles, such particles would not respond to
electromagnetism, the force responsible for light, and thus
would be unable to radiate or reflect light. They would
also be relatively slow-moving, or ""cold"" in physics
jargon, and thus also go by the name of cold dark matter. As Earth in its travels passed through the dark-matter
cloud that presumably envelops the Milky Way, the particles
would shoot through our bodies, rarely leaving a trace,
like moonlight through a window. But the collective gravity of such particles, cosmologists
say, would shape the cosmos and its contents. Gathering along the fault lines laid down by random
perturbations of density in the early universe, dark matter
would congeal into clouds with about the mass of 100,000
Suns. The ordinary matter that was mixed in with it would
cool and fall to the centers of the clouds and light up as
stars. The clouds would then attract other clouds. Through a
series of mergers over billions of years, smaller clouds
would assemble into galaxies, and the galaxies would then
assemble themselves into clusters of thousands of galaxies,
and so forth. Using the Hubble and other telescopes as time machines -
light travels at a finite speed, so the farther out
astronomers look the farther back in time they see -
cosmologists have begun to confirm that the universe did
assemble itself from the ""bottom up,"" as the dark matter
model predicts. Last year, two teams of astronomers reported seeing the
first stars burning their way out of the cloudy aftermath
of the Big Bang, when the universe was only 900 million
years old. The bulk of galaxy formation occurred when the
universe was a half to a quarter its present age,
cosmologists say. ""The big news in the last decade is that even half a
universe ago the universe looked pretty different,"" said
Dr. Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories in
Pasadena. Galaxies before then were small and irregular,
with no sign of the majestic spiral spider webs that
decorate the sky today. We would barely recognize our own Milky Way galaxy, if we
could see it five billion years ago when the Sun formed, he
said. ""By eight billion years back, it would be unrecognizable,""
said Dr. Dressler. Yet there are still many questions that the cold dark
matter model does not answer. Astronomers still do not
know, for example, how the first stars formed or why the
models of dark matter distribution don't quite fit in the
cores of some kinds of galaxies. Nor have the dark matter
particles themselves been unambiguously detected or
identified, despite continuing experiments. Some astronomers suggest that the discrepancies stem from
the inability of simple mathematical models to deal with
messy details of the real world. ""It's a huge mystery exactly how stars form,"" Dr. Richard
Bond of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics
said. ""We can't solve it now. So it's even harder to try to
solve them back then."" But others, notably Dr. Mordehai Milgrom, a theorist at the
Weizmann Institute in Israel, have suggested that modifying
the gravitational laws by which dark matter was deduced in
the first place would alleviate the need for dark matter
altogether. The Bang's Fuel Inflating One Ounce 
To a Whole Universe 
Clues to what had actually exploded
in the Big Bang emerged as an unexpected gift from another
great scientific quest: physicists' pursuit for a so-called
theory of everything that would unite all physical
phenomena in a single equation. Unable to build machines
powerful enough to test their most ambitious notions on
Earth, some theorists turned to the sky. ""The Big Bang is the poor man's particle accelerator,"" Dr.
Jakob Zeldovich, an influential Russian cosmologist, said. Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world
today - gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak
nuclear forces. But they suspect, based on data from
particle accelerators and high-powered theory, that those
are simply different manifestations of a single unified
force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest
moments. As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was
a fall from grace, and the laws of physics evolved, with
one force after another ""freezing out,"" or splitting away. In 1979, Dr. Alan Guth, now at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, realized that a hypothesized glitch in this
process would have had drastic consequences for the
universe. Under some circumstances, a glass of water can
stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees,
until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly
freeze, releasing latent heat in the process. Similarly,
the universe could ""supercool"" and stay in a unified state
too long. In that case, space itself would become
temporarily imbued with a mysterious kind of latent heat,
or energy. Inserted into Einstein's equations, the latent energy would
act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow
itself apart, Dr. Guth discovered in a calculation in 1979.
In far less than the blink of an eye, 10-37 second, a speck
much smaller than a proton would have swollen to the size
of a grapefruit and then resumed its more stately
expansion, with all of normal cosmic history before it,
resulting in today's observable universe - a patch of sky
and stars 14 billion light-years across. All, by the
magical-seeming logic of Einstein's equations, from about
an ounce of primordial stuff. ""The universe,"" Dr. Guth liked to say, ""might be the
ultimate free lunch."" Dr. Guth called his theory inflation. Inflation, as Dr.
Guth pointed out, explains why the universe is expanding.
Dr. Turner of the University of Chicago referred to it as
""the dynamite behind the Big Bang."" As modified and improved by Dr. Andrei Linde, now at
Stanford, and by Dr. Paul Steinhardt, now at Princeton and
Dr. Andreas Albrecht now at the University of California at
Davis, inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology ever
since. One of its great virtues, cosmologists say, is that
inflation explains the origin of galaxies, the main
citizens of the cosmos. The answer comes from the
paradoxical-sounding quantum rules that govern subatomic
affairs. On the smallest scales, according to quantum
theory, nature is lumpy, emitting even energy in little
bits and subject to an irreducible randomness. As a result,
so-called quantum fluctuations would leave faint lumps in
the early universe. These would serve as the gravitational
seeds for future galaxies and other cosmic structures. As a result of such successes, cosmologists have stuck with
the idea of inflation, even though, lacking the ability to
test their theories at the high energies of the Big Bang,
they have no precise theory about what might have actually
caused it. ""Inflation is actually a class of theories,""
said Dr. Guth. In the latest version, called ""chaotic inflation,"" Dr.
Linde has argued that quantum fluctuations in a myriad of
theorized force fields could have done the trick. Indeed, he and others now say they believe that inflation
can occur over and over, spawning an endless chain of
universes out of one another, like bubbles within bubbles. ""The universe inflates on top of itself,"" Dr. Linde told a
physics conference this spring in Princeton. ""It's
happening right now."" The Golden Age New Devices Detect 
Primordial Glow 
If the inflationary
theorists are right, the universe we see, the 14 billion
light-years, is just a tiny piece of a much vaster
universe, or even a whole ensemble of them, forever out of
our view. According to the theory, therefore, our own little patch of
the cosmos should appear geometrically ""flat,"" the way a
section of a balloon looks flat when viewed close up. This
was the universe long thought to be the most beautiful and
simple. But it required, by the logic of Einstein's general
relativity, that there be much more dark matter, or
something, to the universe, enough to ""flatten"" space-time,
than astronomers had found. In fact, this prescription was so hard to reconcile with
other observations, of galaxies and their evolutions, that
by 1991 some astronomers and press reports suggested that
the entire theoretical edifice of inflation to blow up the
universe and cold dark matter to fill it, not to say the
Big Bang itself, might have to be junked. So it was with a sigh of relief that cosmologists greeted
the announcement in April 1992 that NASA's Cosmic
Background Explorer, or COBE, satellite had succeeded in
discerning faint blotches in the primordial cosmic radio
glow. These were the seeds from which, inflation predicted, large
cosmic structures would eventually grow. ""If you're religious, it's like seeing God,"" said Dr.
George Smoot, a physicist from the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory who led the COBE team. Astronomers say COBE signaled a transition in which heroic
ideas about the universe began to be replaced by heroic
data, as long-planned new telescopes and other instruments
went into operation. A year later, skywalking astronauts corrected the Hubble
telescope's myopic vision. The cosmic background radiation
has come in for particular scrutiny from new radio
telescopes mounted in balloons and on mountaintops. The
news has been good, though not decisive, for inflation. For three years, a series of increasingly high-resolution
observations has confirmed that the pattern of blotches
stippling the remnant of the primordial fireball is
consistent with the predictions from inflation and cold
dark matter. The instruments have now mapped details small
enough to have been the seeds of modern clusters of
galaxies. ""I'm completely snowed by the cosmic background radiation,""
Dr. Guth said. ""The signal was so weak it wasn't even
detected until 1965, and now they're measuring fluctuations
of one part in 100,000."" Perhaps most important, the analysis of the fluctuations
indicates that the universe has a ""flat"" geometry, as
predicted by inflation. That was a triumph. Although
observations could not prove that inflation was right, a
nonflat universe would have been a blow to the theory, and
to cosmological orthodoxy. ""Inflation, our boldest and most promising theory of the
earliest moments of creation, passed its first very
important test,"" Dr. Turner said at the time. The most precise measurements of the cosmic background, at
least in the near future, are generally expected to come
late this year from NASA's Microwave Anisotropy Project, or
MAP, satellite, which was launched into space last year on
June 30. MAP will be followed by the European Space
Agency's Planck satellite, in 2006. It is highly unlikely that MAP or Planck will be able to
detect what Dr. Turner calls ""the smoking gun signature of
inflation."" The violent stretching of the universe should
roil space-time with so-called gravitational waves that
would leave a faint imprint on the cosmic fireball. Detecting those waves would not only confirm inflation, but
also might help scientists establish what caused the
inflation in the first place, giving science its first look
at the strange physics that prevailed when creation was
only about a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of
a second old. The Universe's Fate Bleak Implications 
Of `Dark Energy' In 1998, two competing teams of
astronomers startled the scientific world with the news
that the expansion of the universe seemed to be speeding up
under the influence of a mysterious antigravity that seems
embedded in space itself and that is hauntingly reminiscent
of Einstein's old, presumably discredited, cosmological
constant. ""Dark energy,"" the phenomenon was quickly named. If dark
energy is real and the acceleration continues, the galaxies
will eventually speed away from one another so quickly that
they couldn't see one another. The universe would become
cold and empty as the continued acceleration sucked away
the energy needed for life and thought. It would be ""the worst possible universe,"" for the quality
and quantity of life, said Dr. Lawrence Krauss, a physicist
at Case Western Reserve University. Dr. Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, called the discovery of dark energy ""the
strangest experimental finding since I've been in physics.""
The discovery was a surprise to the astronomers involved.
Neither team had expected to find the universe
accelerating. They had each set out to measure by how much
the expansion of the universe was slowing because of the
gravity of its contents and thus settle the question of its
fate. One team was led by Dr. Saul Perlmutter, a physicist at
Lawrence Berkeley. The other team was a band of astronomers
led by Dr. Brian Schmidt of Mount Stromlo and the Siding
Spring Observatory in Australia. Each group employed far-flung networks of telescopes,
including the Hubble, and the Internet to find and monitor
certain exploding stars, or supernovas, as cosmic beacons.
Such explosions, the death rattles of massive stars, are
powerful enough to be seen clear across the universe when
the universe was younger and, presumably, expanding faster.
Leapfrogging each other across the universe, the two teams,
propitiously for their credibility, arrived at the same
answer at the same time: the cosmos was not slowing at all;
it was speeding up. Dr. Perlmutter, who had once resented the competition,
conceded, ""With only one group, it would have been a lot
harder to get the community to buy into such a surprising
result."" ""This was a very strange result,"" said Dr. Adam Riess, a
member of Dr. Schmidt's team. ""It was the opposite of what
we thought we were doing."" The results have sent Einstein's old cosmological constant
to the forefront of cosmology. Despite his disavowal, the
constant had never really gone away and had in fact been
given new life by quantum physics. Einstein had famously
rejected quantum's randomness, saying God didn't play dice.
But it justified, in retrospect, his fudge factor. According to the uncertainty principle, a pillar of quantum
theory, empty space was not empty, but rather foaming with
the energy of so-called virtual particles as they flashed
in and out of existence on borrowed energy. This so-called
vacuum energy could repel, just like Einstein's old
cosmological constant, or attract. The case for dark energy got even stronger a year later,
when the cosmic background observations reported evidence
of a flat universe. Because astronomers had been able to
find only about a third as much matter, both dark and
luminous, as was needed by Einstein's laws to create a flat
geometry, something else had to be adding to it. The discovery of dark energy exemplified Dr. Zeldovich's
view of the universe as the poor man's particle
accelerator, and it caught the physicists flat-footed,
somewhat to the pride of the astronomers. ""A coming of age of astronomy,"" Dr. Dressler called it.
What is dark energy? The question now hangs over the
universe. Is it really Einstein's old fudge factor returned to haunt
his children? In that case, as the universe expands and the
volume of space increases, astronomers say, the push
because of dark energy will also increase, accelerating the
galaxies away from one another faster and faster, leading
to a dire dark future. Other physicists, however, have pointed out that the
theories of modern physics are replete with mysterious
force fields, collectively called ""quintessence,"" that
might or might not exist, but that could temporarily
produce negative gravity and mimic the action of a
cosmological constant. In that case, all bets on the future
are off. The universe could accelerate and then decelerate,
or vice versa as the dark energy fields rose or fell. A third possibility is that dark energy does not exist at
all, in which case not just the future, but the whole
carefully constructed jigsaw puzzle of cosmology, might be
in doubt. The effects of cosmic acceleration could be
mimicked, astronomers say, by unusual dust in the far
universe or by unsuspected changes in the characteristics
of supernovas over cosmic time. As a result, more groups
are joining the original two teams in the hunt for new
supernovas and other ways to measure the effects of dark
energy on the history of the universe. Dr. Perlmutter has proposed building a special satellite
telescope, the Supernova Astronomy Project, to investigate
exactly when and how abruptly the cosmic acceleration
kicked in. The Nagging QuestionsA Grand Synthesis, 
But Hardly Complete 
For all the new answers being
harvested, some old questions linger, and they have now
been joined by new ones. A flat universe is the most mathematically appealing
solution of Einstein's equations, cosmologists agree. But
they are puzzled by the specific recipe, large helpings of
dark matter and dark energy, that nature has chosen. Dr.
Turner called it ""a preposterous universe."" But Dr. Martin Rees, a Cambridge University cosmologist,
said that the discovery of a deeper principle governing the
universe and, perhaps, life, may alter our view of what is
fundamental. Some features of the universe that are now
considered fundamental - like the exact mixture of dark
matter, dark energy and regular stuff in the cosmos - may
turn out to be mere accidents of evolution in one out of
the many, many universes allowed by eternal inflation. ""If we had a theory, then we would know whether there were
many big bangs or one,"" Dr. Rees said. The answers to these
and other questions, many scientists suspect, have to await
the final unification of physics, a theory that reconciles
Einstein's relativity, which describes the shape of the
universe, to the quantum chaos that lives inside it. Such a theory, quantum gravity, is needed to describe the
first few moments of the universe, when it was so small
that even space and time should become fuzzy and
discontinuous. For two decades, many physicists have placed their bets for
quantum gravity on string theory, which posits that
elementary particles are tiny strings vibrating in a 10- or
11-dimensional space. Each kind of particle, in a sense,
corresponds to a different note on the string. In principle, string theory can explain all the forces of
nature. But even its adherents concede that their equations
are just approximations to an unknown theory that they call
M-theory, with ""M"" standing for matrix, magic, mystery or
even mother, as in ""mother of all theories."" Moreover, the
effects of ""stringy physics"" are only evident at energies
forever beyond the limits of particle accelerators. Some string theorists have ventured into cosmology, hoping,
to discover some effect that would show up in the poor
man's particle accelerator, the sky. In addition to strings, the theory also includes membranes,
or ""branes,"" of various dimensions. Our universe can be
envisioned as such a brane floating in higher-dimensional
space like a leaf in a fish tank, perhaps with other brane
universes nearby. These branes could interact
gravitationally or even collide, setting off the Big Bang. In one version suggested last year by four cosmologists
led by Dr. Steinhardt of Princeton, another brane would
repeatedly collide with our own. They pass back and forth
through each other, causing our universe to undergo an
eternal chain of big bangs. Such notions are probably the future for those who are paid
to wonder about the universe. And the fruits of this work could yet cause cosmologists to
reconsider their new consensus, warned Dr. Peebles of
Princeton, who has often acted as the conscience of the
cosmological community, trying to put the brakes on faddish
trends. He wonders whether the situation today can be compared to
another historical era, around 1900, when many people
thought that physics was essentially finished and when the
English physicist Lord Kelvin said that just a couple of
""clouds"" remained to be dealt with. ""A few annoying tidbits, which turned out to be relativity
and quantum theory,"" the twin revolutions of 20th-century
science, Dr. Peebles said. Likewise, there are a few clouds today like what he called
""the dark sector,"" which could have more complicated
physics than cosmologists think. ""I'm not convinced these clouds herald revolutions as deep
as relativity and quantum mechanics,"" Dr. Peebles said.
""I'm not arguing that they won't."" As for the fate of the universe, we will never have a firm
answer, said Dr. Sandage, who was Hubble's protï¿½gï¿½ and has
seen it all. ""It's like asking, `Does God exist?' "" he said.
Predicting the future, he pointed out, requires faith that
simple mathematical models really work to describe the
universe. ""I don't think we really know how things work,"" he said.
Although Dr. Sandage does not buy into all aspects of the
emerging orthodoxy, he said it was a fantastic time to be
alive. ""It's all working toward a much grander synthesis than we
could have imagined 100 years ago,"" he said. ""I think this
is the most exciting life I could have had.""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/23/science/space/23UNIV.html?ex=1028416223&ei=1&en=ff38ea5fac0c9158HOW TO ADVERTISE

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ========================================================== Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2 . Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4 ... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGUREOUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! ========================================================= REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ======================================================= Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and dd METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receivethe report. =========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address. PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : ==================================================== REPORT # 1: ""The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net"" Order Report #1 from: A. Christ 1208 Allendale Rd. Mechanicsburg, PA 17055___________________________________________________________ REPORT # 2: ""The Insider's Guide to Sending Bulk e-mail on the Net"" Order Report # 2 from: Michael P. 2508 Robin Altus, OK 73521 USA ____________________________________________________________ REPORT # 3: ""Secret to Multilevel Marketing on the Net"" Order Report # 3 from : D. J. 16 Northcrest Dr. London, ONTARIO, CANADA N5X 3V8 __________________________________________________________ REPORT # 4: ""How to Become a Millionaire Utilizing MLM & the Net"" Order Report # 4 from:E. Zurbrigg RR #1 St. Marys, ON, Canada N4X 1C4 ____________________________________________________________ REPORT #5: ""How to Send Out 0ne Million e-mails for Free"" Order Report # 5 from: A. Ebert R. R. #4 Thamesford, Ontario, Canada N0M 2M0____________________________________________________________ $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. === After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. === Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ====================================================== FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! ============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================ ""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jodyaboutreceiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spoutingmy knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''. Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ====================================================== ''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big."" Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ======================================================= ''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks."" Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. ======================================================= ''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet."".

original copy of the MBR must be in /boot directory for it to work. 
Which is exactly what I didn't have.  The installation of Linux
Mandrake didn't afford me that luxury.Also, I'm glad you cleared up the fdisk issue.  I know better now --
previously I was under the impression that fdisk had a hidden switch. 
This is obviously not the case.--

File-traders in the crosshairsWhen the recording industry last month let slip plans to sue individuals who trade copyrighted songs on file-swapping services, Web surfers everywhere pulled down their MP3 collections in a frenzy of fear.
OK, not really. Despite the music industry's hopes, such threats have so far been met with a collective yawn in the file-swapping community, which has yet to see much damage in spite of repeated legal wrangling with the Recording Industry Association of America.

 | Read Full Story Will IBM's new ""Shark"" sink or swim?IBM announced a new top-end ""Shark"" storage system Monday that could boost the company's prospects against entrenched competitors in the depressed storage market.
Three years ago, IBM introduced its first Enterprise Storage System product, code-named Shark, in an attempt to rebuild a market it had almost totally ceded to rivals EMC and Hitachi Data Systems.

The study by Mi2g also found that successful attacks on U.K. and U.S. government sites have decreased, which may be due to tougher laws and improved security.

Texas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to SpendAugust 25, 2002
By RIVA D. ATLAS and EDWARD WONG 
 It was one of the first calls David N. Siegel placed when
he became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airways
last March. Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner
and meaner business plan, keep his planes flying and
renegotiate costly contracts with the unions, he flipped
through his files and found the number for the Texas
Pacific Group, an investment firm headed by David
Bonderman, a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation
for fixing problem companies. Mr. Siegel, once a top executive at Continental Airlines,
had watched Texas Pacific's partners turn an investment of
$66 million in the airline, made three years after it filed
for bankruptcy in 1990, into a profit of more than $600
million. And they had made nearly as much on their stake in
America West, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992. That search for advice turned into an offer. Why not let
Texas Pacific have a role in US Airways' revival? asked
Richard Schifter, the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr.
Siegel reached. In June, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Schifter again. And days
before US Airways announced its plans to file for
bankruptcy two weeks ago - but after it had negotiated
about $550 million in concessions with its unions - Texas
Pacific, based in Fort Worth and San Francisco, agreed to
kick in $100 million as part of a $500 million loan to keep
the company operating during bankruptcy. It also agreed to
buy $200 million of stock, or 38 percent of the company,
and take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emerges
from bankruptcy - unless another investor surfaces with a
better offer. ""One of the reasons we were interested is few other folks
were,"" said James Coulter, a partner at Texas Pacific, in
an interview after the bankruptcy filing. ""There aren't
many people around with the stomach or the knowledge to
delve into the airline industry."" Texas Pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buying
businesses no one else wants. Mr. Coulter and Mr. Bonderman
made their names during the recession of the early 1990's
with investments in Continental and America West. The
firm's hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping
companies, sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its
extensive network of contacts for talented replacements. Now the partners are again looking for trouble. In the last
year alone, Texas Pacific has announced or completed six
acquisitions, most in unloved industries like
semiconductors, reinsurance and airlines. Just last month,
it announced plans to buy Burger King, which has been
losing market share, for $2.26 billion. It is also bidding
for Bankgesellschaft Berlin, a large and troubled bank. The most creative, and potentially lucrative, of these
deals could be Texas Pacific's acquisition last November of
MEMC Electronic Materials, a semiconductor company, for $6
- yes, just $6 - in cash. It will also guarantee a $150
million bank loan. In the last few years, most firms that specialize in
leveraged buyouts - the use of junk bonds, bank loans and
other borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies -
have been largely inactive. Falling stock prices have made
managements reluctant to sell cheaply. Companies that are
for sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze. Texas Pacific is different. ""This is a terrific environment
for them,"" said Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of the
Blackstone Group, which also specializes in buyouts. Mark Attanasio, a managing director at Trust Company of the
West, which has invested with Texas Pacific, said: ""Most
other buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing.
You don't see many guys wanting to take on operational
fixes."" Like most other buyout firms, Texas Pacific tries to keep
its inner workings private: its partners rarely grant
interviews and its Web site is perpetually under
construction. Mr. Bonderman, Mr. Coulter and William Price,
the third founding partner, declined to be interviewed for
this article. Mr. Bonderman, 59, is known for his rumpled shirts and
bright, patterned socks. ""He likes argyle socks, and they
tend to fall down around his ankles,"" said Henry Miller, an
investment banker who advises troubled companies. Early in
his career, when he was a Washington lawyer, Mr. Bonderman
argued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit. When a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated, he is known
for obsessively staying in touch, even when he is trekking
in places like Pakistan, Nepal and, most recently, Bhutan.
""Whenever I see a long, unfamiliar phone number pop up on
my caller I.D., I know it's David calling,"" said one
investment banker who often works with Mr. Bonderman. Mr. Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980's as the
chief investment officer for Robert Bass, the Texas oilman.
Mr. Bonderman enriched Mr. Bass a second time by making
early bets in industries like cable television and taking
stakes in troubled companies like American Savings & Loan,
which had been seized by the government. Over nearly a
decade, Mr. Bonderman's picks earned an average annual
return of 63 percent for Mr. Bass. In 1993, Mr. Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr.
Coulter, a former Lehman Brothers banker who had also
worked for Mr. Bass. They teamed up later that year with
Mr. Price, a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain &
Company, a consulting firm, to form Texas Pacific. The three men have complementary skills, investment bankers
and other deal makers said. Mr. Bonderman is the master
strategist and Mr. Coulter is good at structuring deals and
the detailed management of the firm's purchases. Mr. Price
often recruits managers and advises on operational issues. ""David is very much the optimist, very much the deal
maker,"" said Greg Brenneman, a former president of
Continental. ""Jim is very much a counterbalance to David.
He will sit back and ask the tough questions. He will
approach investments a little bit more skeptically than
David does."" By the end of the 1990's, Texas Pacific was well
established in deal making. It easily raised $4.5 billion
from pension funds and other investors in early 2000. To
celebrate their war chest, the firm's partners rented San
Francisco's City Hall and hired the B-52's to play at a
party. But as the stock market began to tumble, Texas Pacific
hesitated. For a 17-month stretch, the partners made no
deals. They checked out some of the biggest corporate
blowups, including Adelphia, Xerox and Global Crossing, but
stayed away, finding the prices and the quality of the
businesses untenable. Instead, Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existing
investments, taking more than $2 billion in profits during
that stretch. ""They started to cash out early in the cycle,"" said Mario
Giannini, chief executive of Hamilton Lane, a money
management firm, some of whose clients are Texas Pacific
investors. The good times of the late 1990's were not ideal for Texas
Pacific - it struggled to find downtrodden companies that
needed its help. But Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the
rough. It revived Oxford Health Plans, the health
maintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the
mid-1990's, almost doubling its money after bringing in new
managers and upgrading computer systems. In 1996, it made a
$280 million investment in Ducati Motor, the Italian
motorcycle maker, whose profits have since more than
quadrupled. But Texas Pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought at
the top of the market. Texas Pacific's $560 million
investment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, for
which it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997,
has been a disappointment. So has its 1999 purchase of
Bally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demand
for luxury goods. Texas Pacific also lost more than $100 million on Zilog, a
semiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker,
both of which filed for bankruptcy. Some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm's
performance. Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings in
two investment funds it raised over the last decade. The
first fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and
including investments made through March 1997, should
return more than 40 percent, according to one Texas Pacific
investor. But its second fund - $2.5 billion raised in 1997
- could return less than half that, this investor
estimated, since the firm had less time to take profits on
these investments before the stock market sank. But because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdings
in the second fund, profits on these investments could
rebound. It is hoping, for example, that with new
management in place, J. Crew will turn around as the
economy rebounds. In any case, one competitor said, ""their
returns look pretty good when you consider that some other
funds won't return any capital"" to investors. But with the weak economy throwing many companies into
trouble, Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier
success, the investor said. ""They should do exceptionally
well,"" he said. Texas Pacific has a distinct style - if not formula. It
relies on talented, self-sufficient managers to restructure
troubled companies, preferring to remain hands-off, except
for surveillance from the boardroom. When necessary, it
replaces managers. Less than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy,
for example, Mr. Bonderman watched with frustration as his
old friend Robert R. Ferguson, the chief executive, led it
to the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court. Continental's board, where Mr. Bonderman was chairman, then
brought in Gordon M. Bethune, an executive at Boeing, and
in October 1994 he replaced Mr. Ferguson as chief
executive. Mr. Bethune quickly did a top-to-bottom overhaul
of the company and is now considered a great turnaround
artist of the industry. ""The biggest conflict I've ever seen was with Bob
Ferguson,"" said Clark Onstad, a former general counsel for
the Federal Aviation Administration, in describing the
thinking of Mr. Bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982
Braniff bankruptcy. ""He chose Bethune over his longtime
friend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do a
better job."" At America West, Texas Pacific initiated an even more
extensive management overhaul. This time, the charge was
led by Mr. Coulter and Mr. Schifter, both directors. W. Douglas Parker, the current chief executive, flew to Mr.
Coulter's home in San Francisco to interview for the job of
chief financial officer. They talked for hours, and Mr.
Parker said the two men quickly realized they had ""somewhat
kindred spirits."" The board replaced most senior managers at America West,
except William Franke, the chief executive, who stepped
down last September. His restructuring plan had made the
airline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from
bankruptcy in August 1994. Texas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West, worth
about $33.7 million. But those are controlling shares, and
the group holds more than 50 percent of the votes. ""These are not passive investors, nor am I,"" said Donald L.
Sturm, a Denver businessman who serves on Continental's
board with Mr. Bonderman and Mr. Price. ""You're active.
Your money is at stake. Your reputation is at stake."" After overseeing managers who worked successfully with
unions at Continental and America West, Texas Pacific has a
good reputation with labor. That was one reason US Airways
was interested in a Texas Pacific investment, said Chris
Chiames, a spokesman for the airline. Mr. Siegel wanted an investor who would ""be as labor
friendly as possible,"" Mr. Chiames said. But US Airways can
still entertain other bids this fall, and Marvin Davis, the
billionaire investor from Los Angeles, has expressed
interest. Texas Pacific's investment in Burger King, made with
Goldman, Sachs and Bain Capital, was announced after two
years of discussions among Texas Pacific's partners and the
chain's franchisees - even before the company, which had
been owned by Diageo, the liquor company, was put up for
sale, said Julian Josephson, chairman of the National
Franchisee Association, which represents most Burger King
franchisees. ""We liked what they had to say about the human component of
the businesses they buy,"" Mr. Josephson said. Many other
owners, he added, ""are dismissive of labor."" At Burger King, Texas Pacific will also be working with an
executive it knows. Burger King's chief executive is John
Dasburg, the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines,
who met Mr. Bonderman and his partners when Northwest
bought out their stake in Continental in 1998. Unlike most buyout firms, Texas Pacific remains enamored
with the technology industry, despite the failure of so
many start-ups the last two years. It has focused on the
semiconductor industry, which like the airline industry is
highly cyclical. So far, though, results have been mixed. The firm's 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation,
which makes equipment for high-speed Internet connections,
has been a huge success. Texas Pacific split it in two and
took both parts public in the late 1990's, selling most of
its stakes for 23 times its investment. But a much larger
investment, its $400 million acquisition of Zilog, the chip
maker, in 1998, was made just before the economic crisis in
Asia caused chip prices to plummet. Zilog filed for
bankruptcy last year. Texas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third
company, ON Semiconductor, which it acquired for $1.6
billion three years ago. It invested $100 million more last
year. Its latest gamble on the industry, the $6 deal for MEMC,
may prove the most lucrative. The cost of mailing the
payment to E.On, based in Dï¿½sseldorf, Germany, was actually
more than the acquisition, one executive close to the deal
said. Texas Pacific, and its partners in the deal, Trust Company
of the West and Leonard Green & Partners, agreed to
guarantee a $150 million revolving line of credit. Texas
Pacific also assumed $900 million worth of debt, most of
which it swapped for more stock in the company. ""They did a good job of timing the acquisition,"" said
Nabeel Gareeb, the company's chief executive, who noted
that in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profit
since the fourth quarter of 2000. But Texas Pacific's interest in airlines is clearly
sizable. Besides its involvement in Continental, America
West and US Airways, the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet,
the catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group. Two years ago, Texas Pacific started a Web-based discount
ticket service called Hotwire. It put up most of the $75
million in seed money, then persuaded six airlines to
invest with it, said Karl Peterson, the chief executive.
Hotwire, instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets, as
Priceline does, shows the cheapest ticket on its Web site
but does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until
after the sale. The contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt
Hotwire, which is privately owned. Mr. Peterson said that
the company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacific
remains committed to it. Last spring, Mr. Peterson met Mr. Bonderman in Aspen to
talk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding. Mr. Bonderman
seemed perfectly willing to accompany Hotwire down the
steep Internet chute. But he does have his limits on risk,
Mr. Peterson discovered. Before going down the mountain,
Mr. Bonderman strapped on a helmet. ï¿½ http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/business/yourmoney/25TEXA.html?ex=1031278887&ei=1&en=05fca479b8bcee6bHOW TO ADVERTISE

"zellig harris last thursday night , may 21 , zellig harris died in his sleep after a pleasant working day . he was 88 years old . he was born in 1904 in byelorussia . i am told that he chose the name zellig sabbettai when his family immigrated to the united states when he was four . i like to think that the semantics of happiness and steadfastness were on his mind . certainly they were keynotes of his life . i would guess that his parents chose the name harris . when he died , he was just finishing a book on politics that he had been planning for most of his life . with the 1992 publication of his book _ a theory of language and information _ ( oxford ) , he had wrapped up his life 's work on language , at least for the time being . he seems to have felt at liberty to take up this other unfinished business . i understand from paul mattick , jr . , who was harris 's friend and neighbor for many years in new york , that this last book describes how to get from capitalism to socialism . this is surely not a conventional take on either capitalism or socialism , harris was an anarchist . oxford was interested in publishing it , and he had also talked with cambridge . there is no memorial planned , beyond something very private for his family . however , there is some discussion beginning of a public meeting with scientific content . i would hope that the festschrift that haj ross called for in the lsa meetings some years ago might at last come into being . harris described himself as a methodologist rather than a linguist . this could be misleading . he always said that his work was not part of linguistics as it is institutionally defined , and that linguists would not be interested in his work , though people interested in language would be . nonetheless , he was surely a linguist by most of the operational definitions one might come up with . he had done extensive fieldwork on a variety of language . when he was doing the final revision of the 1992 oxford book , he undertook to test the theory of language against every language of which he had some control , 44 languages . he spent months reading grammars from morning to night , and evaluating whether his theory had a reasonable account for what he found there . he was clear that no scientific conclusions were warranted , and so no particular notice of this check is given in the book , but he wanted to feel reasonably secure that his conclusions were not idiosyncratic to english , french , german , korean , and the few other languages that had been the primary bases for their development . he was pleased with the results . his contributions to the field were numerous and weighty . he founded the first linguistics department in the u . s . he introduced the algebraic representations and abstract mathematical treatment which have become so much norms of the field that it is difficult now to appreciate how much he did so over the kicking and screaming protests of his peers . he invented x - bar notation for immediate constituent analysis , though of course not by that name , to cope with the well known weakness of ic analysis with the head-of relation . he developed ways to accomodate discontinuous morphemes into grammatical analysis . he charted a way out of difficulties experienced by bloch and others in phonology , by saying that contrast rather than phonetic identity is the basis for setting up phonemes , a ghost that has risen to haunt generative phonology more than once . he invented string analysis as a complement ( not rival ) to immediate constituent analysis . their complementarity with respect to the head-of problem is the basis of joshi 's tree - adjoining grammars ( tags ) . he invented transformational analysis in context of developing discourse analysis to get at the information content of texts . other contributions await recognition and exploitation in the field of linguistics as institutionalized today , and in other fields . obvious examples include sublanguage analysis and sublanguage grammar , operator grammar based on word dependency , discourse analysis for information content , and his theory of information as an account of a central aspect of semantics . for example , string grammar and its natural extension into transformational grammar is the basis of the very successful work of naomi sager and others at nyu in information formatting of sublanguage texts , applied there mainly to medical informatics . stephen johnson has implemented a system for representing the information content of texts , based on operator grammar . successes of this sort are little noticed within linguistics . it is characteristic of harris that there was no vanity or self importance in him . he knew that his work was of lasting importance , and treated it as such , but he was no guru or empire builder seeking followers , and would not accept any such role being projected onto him . those students who sought entree to linguistics as a social institution in academia were bound to be disappointed . however , he could scarcely be blamed for their disappointment . he did not provide such entree , nor did he pretend to , and in my hearing actively discouraged students who imagined work with him would further their ambitions in the field . once , in my role as ta for john fought , i prepared a lecture on harris 's approach to syntax and semantics . as we were setting out for the lecture hall , we encountered harris , and i blurted out "" i ' m about to give a lecture on your theory to john 's class . "" ( john , with characteristic wry humor , asked if he wanted to take anything back . ) harris bemusedly questioned whether anyone would be interested in what he was doing . nonetheless , when he gave a public lecture on "" the two structures of language : report and paraphrase "" in 1969 or 1970 , the large auditorium ( i think it was in the furness building ) was filled to capacity , and the critique by john corcoran , published later in the volume _ transformationelle analyse _ edited by senta ploetz , was also well attended . broad attendance on and acclaim for his work could easily have been his , had he chosen it . that is simply not where his ambitions lay . a clue as to the basis of this choice against fame and influence may perhaps be found in his advice to a student starting out in his first teaching position , many years ago . do n't invite anybody over for dinner , he said , and do n't accept any invitations . if you get involved in the social life of an academic , you won't be able to get any work done . the work came first . harris was always an intensely loyal man to his friends and family . the consequences , when combined with his laissez-faire anarchism , were not always happy . his friend and close colleague of many years , henry hiz , was much more concerned with building a formal linguistics program as an institution . the disparity of character could be devastating to students . i studied with harris from 1966 through 1970 . i was an undergraduate much of that time , but that did not matter to him . he had a sink-or - swim approach like that attributed to sapir ( darnell 1990 ) , except that his seminars were of course focussed on theory rather than the data of , say , athabaskan . he would come in to his seminar and just start talking about what he was working on . when i started with him , this was the work that resulted in his 1968 book , _ mathematical structures of language _ ( wiley ) . the process was not a lecture or monologue , but a continuing conversation with his students , trying out alternatives , posing and working out problems for a mathematical characterization of language . after a while , with intensive reading outside , one began to catch on and to participate . i recall telling him at the end of one seminar meeting in my first year that i would try to disprove his theory . this troubled him not a bit . i worked up a problem in modern greek that i thought might be troublesome for his approach . ( i had lived in greece for a couple of years , and spoke the language , but i worked with an informant for this project . ) when my results turned out actually to corroborate the point i had intended to challenge , he merely thanked me for the data on greek . a year or two later , i had come up with a proposal to analyze definitions in a dictionary to extract semantic primitives by a form of componential analysis , much as martha evens and now others have done . although the notion of semantic features seems inimical in concept and method to his work , he said ( and this is an exact quote ) "" others have tried this and have failed , but you are welcome to try . "" i offer this in refutation of the sometimes heard view that harris was dictatorial . i ran into conflicts in such matters with hiz , never with harris . i have also heard it asked why he never retorted to attacks on his work . i think it did not matter to him . he did not expect his methods and results to be understood and taken up by everyone in the field of linguistics . maybe his attitude differed in the 1940s , when he wrote the structural restatements and the manuscript eventually published as _ methods in structural linguistics _ . ( btw , the title was to have said "" descriptive "" but the publisher substituted the buzzword "" structural . "" i recall him saying , amusedly , "" i do n't remember whether they asked me or not . "" ) maybe his expectations of the field changed after some of chomsky 's followers began making him out to be the bad guy . i do n't think so , based on his writings and on the testimony of some who were his students then . i never heard him comment on the commonplace attribution to chomsky of the discovery of transformational grammar and the "" transformational revolution . "" there is a passage in _ the state of the art _ ( 1968 ) in which hockett attributes to harris "" nothing , or a long silence , after 1957 , "" showing ignorance not only of things like string analysis , for which he might be excused , but even ignoring the 1965 paper transformational theory prominently published in _ language _ . i showed this passage to harris , and he shrugged . it did not matter . in particular , i never saw any evidence that harris opposed or blocked chomsky 's ambitions . in my experience it would have been entirely out of character for him . for example , it was harris who proposed chomsky to speak in his stead to the 1962 international congress . a similar canard regarding bernard bloch has recently been laid to rest in an editorial in language . one must i think be alert to the social psychology that leads some people to rewrite history so that their avatar is depicted as an embattled hero . now , an old indian friend once told me that one cannot point a finger without having three other fingers of the same hand pointing back , so i hasten to add that this is not the picture i intend to paint here of harris . he accomplished what he intended to quite well , thank you very much , and seems to have been quite happy in the process . the point is precisely that he seemed in no way embattled by attacks and uncomprehending misconstruals of his work . and uncomprehending misconstruals abound . frawley 's review of _ a grammar of english on mathematical principles _ ( gemp ) is a good example . he identifies harris 's operator grammar with predicate calculus , though harris is at pains to delineate critical differences between language ( a fortiori operator grammar ) and language-like mathematical systems , including predicate calculus . frawley can see in this comprehensive grammar only an attempt to do 1960s generative grammar in 1980 , because he is unable to step out of the generativist paradigm so as to understand harris 's work on its own terms . another review ( eric wheeler , 1984 in _ computers in the humanities _ ) asserted that harris 's grammar was unable to account for certain familiar semantic problems - - middle voice , the semantics of find vs . seek , and quantifier scope in examples like "" someone was opposed by everyone . "" in my review ( _ computational linguistics _ in 1984 ) i showed how harris did in fact account of each of these problems in the book . michael kac , in his review of harris 's selected writings , asked "" why bother ? "" and indeed , from within the generativist paradigm that must be the only plausible question . it is only in setting aside paradigmatic blinkers that one can see , having these writings in one place , how consistent and self coherent harris 's program has been over the years . transformational grammar was not a revolutionary break but part of a continuous evolution . i will mention only one other misconception about harris 's work , not because it is in any way fundamental but because it is so commonplace . i probably will be greeted with disbelief when i say that discovery procedures were not his aim . ( jim mccawley 's witticism about harris and discovery procedures in the collection traditionally circulated in may really reverses the roles of the teller and the butt of the joke . ) it is not hard to see how linguists have come to this mistaken belief . discovery procedures are an abiding fixture for linguistics as institutionally defined . when _ methods _ was published , linguists sought an aid to fieldwork and writing of linguistic descriptions . now , discovery procedures are institutionalized as a whipping boy . this has colored perceptions of harris 's intentions and results . for harris , it was certainly of interest and value when redundancy on one level of linguistic representation could be used in a practical way to determine boundaries of objects on the next , but this was a corroborative byproduct , not an aim . the "" constructional procedure "" described in the 1955 paper from phoneme to morpheme was implemented in fortran in the early 1960s and proven to work , and ralph grishman has had some preliminary success in implementing programs to discover word classes and rules of sublanguage grammar from sublanguage texts . but in general harris did not think that discovery procedures were feasible . in particular , he told me he thought that grammatical analysis could not be done solely with a corpus or by asking informants , one had to control the language oneself . and then one had to work over the data to tease out pattern and wrestle it into coherent form , a lengthy and demanding process , as probably most of us know from experience . so much for the popularized image of feeding in a corpus , turning a crank , and having a grammar reel out the other end . in the introduction to _ methods in structural linguistics _ , harris states clearly that these methods are not discovery procedures . he accepts that one uses many means to come up with proposals for describing what is going on in a language - - hunches , guesses , heuristic rules of thumb , typological generalizations , proposed universals , comparison with related languages or earlier stages of the language , and so on , more art than science ( or rather , more art than engineering ) . harris was acutely aware of the danger of swamping one 's control of the language by growing familiarity with marginal examples . language is after all a social institution , continuously in change as it is constantly recreated in the crucible of use . the aim of the methods was not to substitute for these informal ways of coming up with possible analyses , but to verify , for any given result , whether the result had a valid relation to the data of the language . of those who have actually read the book , how many have said ( and some have in fact said to me ) "" he did n't really mean that . "" but if nothing else , harris was always careful to say exactly what he meant . this concern for verification arises out of a deeper concern which becomes more explicit in harris 's later work . this is a critical point for linguistics . for any other science , there is a standpoint external to the science domain for its metascience . in particular , practitioners in physics , chemistry , even in mathematics , rely on the "" background vernacular "" of language to ensure communication about shared meanings and ultimately to validate the relation of conclusions , however reached , to the observations on which they are based . not so for a science of language . harris recognized and accepted that there is no vantage point outside of language from which to describe language . and , observably , each language contains its own metalanguage . i ' ll repeat that , because it is i think a key to understanding what harris was about , and because it is easy to overlook its importance . there is no vantage point outside of language from which to describe language . by contrast , generativist theory postulates a universal metalanguage , external to language , that is part of one 's biological endowment . ( i personally do not find this biologicist , neophrenologist doctrine of mental organs credible , but the issue rests not on opinion but on facts yet to be determined . ) this stance seems to me perfectly consonant with the argument made by stephen anderson in "" why phonology is n't natural . "" one cannot derive linguistic structure from the findings of some study bearing a metascience relation to linguistics . harris was interested in how language can carry or transmit information , and this is the thread that underlies the really remarkable consistency in his work over more than 50 years . intuitively , we know that differences in form correlate with differences in meaning , but the correlation is messy and inconsistent in the observed data of language ( say , in a body of writings or of phonemic transcriptions , including whatever utterances the investigator may come up with in the ad hoc search for examples ) . what harris found was how this messy , inconsistent stream of words can be the product of two concurrent systems : a system of word dependencies that correlates with perceptions in a subject-matter domain such as a science subfield , and a system of reductions that changes word shapes ( often to zero ) , motivated in part by issues of redundancy and efficiency and in part by historically contingent social convention . the reductions introduce degeneracies such as ambiguity and paraphrase , and otherwise obscure the correlation of form with meaning , but without destroying that correlation . given that structure ( differences of form ) correlates with meaning , it is of critical importance that the machinery of description not import any structure extraneous to that found in language . harris 's endeavor was always , then , to determine a "" least grammar , "" a description that required an absolute minimum of primitive objects and relations . any additional objects or relations in the description introduce extrinsic structure that obscures the informational structure in language . this could be the basis for a telling critique of various other theories of language . harris chose not to make such a critique . when i asked him once about certain aspects of generativist theory , he would only comment , with evidence of mild amusement , that it did seem to be over-structured . like his teacher , sapir , harris had an interest in problems of international communication and an international auxiliary language . ( a paper on this appeared in a 1962 volume on avoiding world war iii . remember wwiii , everyone ? ) and like sapir and bloomfield he had in particular a long standing interest in international cooperation and communication in science . this culminated in _ the form of information in science : analysis of an immunology sublanguage _ ( with michael gottfried , tom ryckman , and others , 1989 , john benjamins ) . this book describes the grammar of the sublanguage of immunology during a specific period in the development of that field , based on discourse analysis of sublanguage texts from that period and adequate for making explicit the information structures in arbitrary other texts in that sublanguage . the analysis shows how the structure of the sublanguage changed concurrently with a change in immunologists ' perceptions in the domain of their science . a difference in informational structure correlates with a difference in meaning . the informational structures that are clearly represented in the binary array resulting from discourse analysis are still present in the actual form of the source texts as written albeit obscured under reductions in word shape , some motivated by considerations of informational efficiency and avoidance of redundancy , some dictated by conventions of language use as a human social institution . harris arranged his life so as to enhance the autonomy of his work . i understand that his kibbutz in israel is a wealthy one , to which members give their assets and income , and which in turn supports them in their needs . i believe that the kibbutz purchased his apartment building on charles street . until his retirement , he held an endowed chair at penn , the benjamin franklin professorship in linguistics . he was principal investigator for a long series of grants from the nsf , nimh , and other agencies whose committees and referees found his work of continuing value . throughout his life he was involved with scientists and science . his wife was a physicist at the university of jerusalem , and had been albert einstein 's assistant at princeton . a brother was an immunologist ( he is an author of some of the work analyzed in the 1989 book ) . he felt that the rough and tumble of polemic attack and retort was inappropriate for science , and would not participate in it . that too would be a distraction from the work . after one of the bampton lectures at columbia in 1986 , a young member of the audience approached him and asked what he would take up if he had another lifetime before him . he mentioned poetry , especially the longer works of 19th century poets like browning . he mentioned music . and he mentioned sign language . he had a long and very productive life . he had brought his life 's work to a successful culmination . with the completion of his book on politics , i imagine death coming to him , as to the chess playing knight in the seventh seal , and him saying "" ok , i ' m ready now . "" it was a privilege to know him and to learn from him . he is an abiding inspiration . bruce nevin bn @ bbn . com",Safe Email

"Hello
 
You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!
 
With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!
 
I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling.
 
I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.
 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:
 
Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.
 
THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET! 
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!
 
Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.
 
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ""absolutely 
NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if 
people can 'follow the simple instructions' they are bound to 
make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".
 
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.
 
This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""
 
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!
 
INSTRUCTIONS:
 
=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====
 
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.
 
===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.
 
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.
 
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it.
 
Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!
 
This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.
 
1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement 
and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This 
person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting 
their fortune.
 
2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
 
3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
 
4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
 
5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2
 
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.
 
PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.
 
==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
 
Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:
 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
==================================================
 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.
 
Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.
 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.
 
Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.
 
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.
 
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).
 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00
 
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! 
==================================================
 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?
 
There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!
 
METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
==================================================
 
Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.
 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.
 
===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.
 
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$
 
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
 
=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.
 
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.
 
** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.
 
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!! 
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.
 
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them.
 
Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.
 
IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !
 
=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work.
 
Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""
 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.
 
The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""
 
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""
 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. 
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

Sometimes I find that if I don't try to write code in the least space
possible or for example become lazy and say--Bad style

	When I should say
If(q==true)
	
Or--Bad optimizationint a;
a=some_function();

of the coding.... it's considered 'bad' apparently.Or for example say you are writing a loop that saysFor(a=0;a>--

model(s) of copy and paste.  Not in those words... but that
was how I read it. ;)I have a lot of trouble copying and pasting from or to exmh 
across a VNC link (from things in the vncviewer to things not in 
it and vice versa).  As long as I stick to apps being ""normally"" 
displayed on my X server I don't have much of a problem.My recollection from my X programming days is that the X model,
like everything in X, is more complex than the human brain can
handle.  It also is very different from the MS-Windows model.
And I get the feeling that Tk tries to ""unify"" those two models
and fails.  Not sure what the exmh-specific contribution to the 
confusion is, frankly.--Hal

Date: Not suppliedDVD Capture is an AppleScript for OS X that captures screen-grabs from DVDs. OS 
X normally disables screen-capture while the DVD player is running (even if it 
isn't visible!). I have some home movies on DVD that I'd love to get stills 
from, but I can't -- the DVD licensing board has forced Apple to break my 
hardware in such a way as to prevent me from doing something completely lawful,

A successful friend of mine called to inform me 
thatÂ an
exclusive
recruiting software called The A-B-C Wealth Building
SystemÂ would revolutionize networking as we now 
know it.Â 
He
asked me to simply reply with the answers to the SIX simple 
questions and
they
would set up an Internet Business for me for 
FREE,Â it would
cost me
zero to do it AND they guaranteed me a check before I spent a 
dime!
I
am glad I trusted him because I would normally ignore a pitch 
like that
cause
its sounded to good to be true. I appeased him and replied with 
the answers
to
the SIX simple questions, then they set up my business for me 
fro
FREE!I
am grateful I did! I now have over 120 folks in my powerline in 
less than a
week
and growing like crazy. They were recruited and placed there by 
this new
software and the A-B-C Team. It blew my mind and I've already 
made money
without
doing anything. Replying withÂ my infoÂ was all it took; 
see for
yourself. Your PowerLine will grow like MAD! You can bet I will 
learn even
more
about The A-B-C Wealth Building SystemÂ . This incredible 
software has
only
been in use forÂ 6 weeks!This is by far the best 
system I
have
seen in 12 years in this business!Now even those who have 
never made
money
before ARE!Now that I've done my part by alerting 
you to this
awesome opportunity, the rest is up to you. You owe it to 
yourself to
reply with the answers to the SIX simple 
question, let them
set
up your Internet Business for FREE and see what happens 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT
PROGRAM YOU'RE PRESENTLY WORKING.NOTE: The first in gets the most spill in a 
Powerline.

this email and you are first, you will have 99 
people in
your
powerline, if your the 50th you will have 49,if your the 90th 
you will have

NEW PATENTED PRODUCT is designed to REPAIR SKIN DAMAGE & REJUVENATE TISSUE! Successfully addresses WRINKLES, DARK CIRCLES, AGE SPOTS, FINE LINES, LESIONS, SPIDER VEINS, SKIN TAGS, SCAR TISSUE, CELLULITE, STRETCH MARKS, and MORE for most people the Â“LookGoodDuoÂ” is Hypoallergenic !Research, which began many years ago, has concluded that ellagic acid, derived from a compound called ellagitannins, is a very powerful substance. The highest concentration of ellagitannins are found in raspberry seeds. The delivery of the ellagitannins, however, is the key to the effectiveness of the product. We use raspberry seed materials processed using a patented method, which is the ONLY method that guarantees the maximum delivery of available phytoestrogens, polyphenols, and antioxidants. Ellagic acid from raspberry seed ellagitannins is the most powerful and complete polyphenolic, phytoestrogen, antioxidant material yet discovered! These plant based compounds, or phytoestrogens, when absorbed, provide many beneficial effects including stimulation of collagen formation. It is now known that the powerful agents in the raspberry seed materials tone the tiny blood vessels under the eye and decrease the release of the brown chemical pigment. The results are a decrease the appearance of the dark circles under the eyes. These materials also help to decrease the appearance of ""AGE"" brown spots, while smoothing WRINKLES, strengthening HAIR and NAILS, and supporting many other significant health issues! CELLULITE is simply FAT that is tethered down because certain cells in our skin are stimulated by estrogens. The phytoestrogens, polyphenols, and antioxidants from both ORAL and TOPICAL sources of ellagic acid interfere with that tethering process resulting in a smoother skin surface. We offer this Patented material in both a tablet and a topical cream. Taken both internally and externally, it is easy to understand how they can achieve such obvious results so quickly, working from the inside-out AND from the outside-in.  Happy users report a healthy Â“GLOWÂ” which they have never achieved with any other product! 
PRODUCT TESTIMONIALS I've been using the product for a little over a month. I took the ""2 face challenge', and I could tell a difference in only 3 days! The lines on my face and the pores had changed!  I have had people compliment my fingernails. They have been growing like crazy!  C.C., OHThis is a unique, one of a kind product.   I have been using it 3 weeks and I can truly see a difference in the liver spots on my hands. The prescription from my dermatologist didn't do it, but this product did.  M.F., MSI have been watching myself very closely, and since using the product, the brown spots on my hand have just about disappeared. The smile lines and the eyelids have really tightened up. No more problems putting my eyeliner on! The skin under my chin has really tightened up.  This is not hard work, it is just sharing the product with family and friends. I have never been rewarded so quickly and so well.   E.P., CAK.D., TX I was queen of skeptical.  I did not want to try this.  I am a 54 yr old grandmother.  I have tried everything for years to get rid of cellulite - the creams, the wraps - nothing worked.  My husband kept telling me to try this.  Finally I did it just to get him off my back.  I had not worn shorts for 5 years.  After about 10 days, my husband started telling me my legs were looking better.  I thought he was just being nice since he got me into this.   Then I went shopping, and in the lights in the dressing room, for the first time in a long time I looked pretty good.  I went into the next dressing room, because I thought the lights were wrong, but I still looked good.  I ended up buying shorts, and have been wearing shorts for the 1st time in 5 years.  Yes, it works!! G.C., TXWe just had a booth at the womenÂ’s expo in Dallas.  Out of the 300 or 400 exhibitors there, the only other spot that had the people we did were the ones giving out free food.   V.C., TXI did the 1 side of the face test, and I did not tell my spouse that I was doing it.  We went to get some  fast food.  He was looking at me, and said Â“I can tell you which side you are using it on.  ItÂ’s your right side.Â”  I asked what made him think so, and he said the lines around my mouth and eyes have softened, and the fine lines around my neck.  We are tickled, because everyone we talk to wants it!  J.D., TX Â“After using your product for less than a week, I ran into a friend who asked me what I was doing to look so YOUNG!  I have a full- time job, but I have made $8,000 since starting this business part time!Â“   T.H.,Tx
---------------------------------------
Â”I have found a system that works.  I have 44 people in my group in less than a month! In one month I made over $6,000! Â“ B.M., NH
---------------------------------------------------------------
Â”I am receiving 6 checks a month, and I do not even know where they are coming from!Â”  W.T., TX
---------------------------------------------------------------
Â”I have been in the company 3 weeks, and already have over 20 people in my group.  This is the easiest thing I have ever done.  All I do is tell them my story and give them the hotline number.Â” ---------------------------------------------------------------
At a restaurant, I went to the restroom with a girlfriend and was telling her about what this product does.  We went back to the table, and in a few minutes 2 women walked up to me.  They said they were in the stalls and overheard us talking, and wanted some of the product.  I gave them a brochure, and noticed they went to 2 different tables.  They weren't even together!  J.M., TX

about and get yours at http://www.secureie.com/p/nnt1/
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>01. READERS WRITE.  A Wisconsin subscriber wrote to express his displeasure 
with the links contained in Neat Net Tricks.  It seems he is bothered by 
the frequent pop-up ads and he felt that only those sites without the ads 
should be featured in NNT, particularly in the Premium issue. We replied 
that pop-ups can be annoying but, while not defending them, we must realize 
that they are a form of marketing in which the site owner hopes to recover 
his costs and possibly make a profit.  We suggested using a pop-up stopper 
(there are lots of them on the Web) and ALT F4 will quickly close active 
pop-up windows.  Finally, we pointed out that no publication can guarantee 
only sites without pop-up ads.  As we've often said in the past, the 
Internet isn't free and never was.  Someone has to pay the freight and if 
those ads are unprofitable, they will cease to exist.02. EXTENSION SEARCH.  Next time a file extension has you puzzled, try the 
database at http://extsearch.com/ information.03. DUMB MESSAGES REVISITED.  Not long ago we mentioned a few dumb messages 
we see from our computer and invited others to share their favorite 
""dumbness.""  A reader frequently gets a banner ad that asks ""Do you click 
on banner ads.""  She asks, if you don't, how do you click ""No"" without 
clicking on the banner ad? Others galled at their computers crashing, then 
sitting through the Scandisk operation and being reminded ""To avoid seeing 
this screen again, always shut down Windows properly"" as if it was their 
fault. Another reader nominates the download site at 
http://www.microsoft.com/NTWorkstation/downloads/PowerToys/Networking/NTTweakUI.asp 
for having a really dumb comment.  After downloading a Windows update, it 
says:  ""How to Get Started -- You don't need to do anything after 
downloading"" and he asks, ""what's the point of downloading?""  Still another 
reader nominates the instruction manual for the Windows Internet 
Information Server (ILS) accessible only when ILS is operating.  Thus, the 
entire section on troubleshooting a nonfunctional installation is 
inaccessible at precisely the moment one needs to consult it.  But judging 
by the sheer quantity of email, the top dumb instruction has to be the 
message that ""Keyboard not detected, Press (whatever key) to 
Continue.""  Keep them coming and we'll do it again in a future issue!04. XP TWEAK.  A recent article reminded readers of the neat things that 
can be done with TweakUI, but the XP operating system was not supported by 
the Tweak at that link.  Never fear, XP folks, you'll find a whole array of 
power tools included Tweak - all for XP - at

/ui"" without quotes.  The information displayed is color-coded.  Error 
messages are in red, warnings are in blue.  Green denotes registry entries, 
Configuration Manager information is in brown and file attributes are shown 
in magenta.06. TRAINING WINDOWS.  One pet peeve is Windows' determination to identify 
a shortcut icon as ""Shortcut to (whatever)""  This is pure redundancy, since 
shortcuts are identified by an arrow.  And, with the added verbage of 
""Short cut to"" you can't jump from one icon to another by pressing the 
first letter (since they would all start with an ""s"".  If you keep removing 
""Shortcut to,"" Windows will eventually understand your intent and future 
shortcuts won't include ""Shortcut to"".07. HOLD THAT BUTTON.  The site at http://www.holdthebutton.com/ invites 
you to hold the mouse key down.  Now, before you hastily jump to 
conclusions that there's nothing more to this site, when you release the 
button, you are told how you rank in stamina with other button 
holders.  And when I took my turn at the controls, I found that the longest 
record was a little over six hours, proving once again that some folks need

"good to meet you ! dear friend , i am paul yorke , staff of international private banking at hsbc bank . i am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our banks management 3 years ago . i would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail . i contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication . i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you . in 2000 , the subject matter ; came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division . he informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8 . 35 million united states dollars , which he wished to have us turn over ( invest ) on his behalf . i was the officer assigned to his case , i was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de - facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector , especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank . we met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed . i encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings . the favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments . based on my advice , we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation , the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 10 million united states dollars , this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments . in mid 2001 , he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the united kingdom . he directed that i liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm in here london . i informed him that hsbc would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process , the bank would have to make a 9 . 5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges . he complained about the charges but later came around when i explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us . cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9 / 11 . i contacted my affiliate in here in london and made the funds available to the security firm . i undertook all the processes and made sure i followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the london based security consultancy firm , corporate securities co . corporate securities co is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash . this small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well - connected organizations . in line with instructions , the money was deposited with corporate securities co . the deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from norway later that week . this was the last communication we had , this transpired around 25 th february 2003 . in june last year , we got a call from corporate securities co informing us that the inactivity of that particular portfolio . this was an astounding position as far as i was concerned , given the fact that i managed the private banking sector i was the only one who knew about the deposit at corporate securities co , and i could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his deposit . i made futile efforts to locate the deceased . i immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of hsbc . four days later , information started to trickle in , apparently our client was dead . a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in canne , south of france . we were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed . the bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate . if you are familiar with private banking affairs , those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity , but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes . in his bio - data form , he listed no next of kin . in the field of private banking , opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence , accounts are rarely held under a name ; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous . this bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself , ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said , rarely do they nominate next of kin . private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care , in this case ; the deceased died without a testate . in line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away , we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate . this investigation has for the past months been unfruitful . we have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem . it is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased . my official capacity dictates that i am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation . you have unfortunately declared that you are in no way affiliated with this individual . what this means , you being the last batch of names we have considered , is that our dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable family member . this leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit . according to practice , corporate securities co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to hsbc , failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to hsbc . this will result in the money entering the hsbc accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division . this will not happen if i have my way . what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something . it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational . the world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios . you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what i propose . there is us $ 8 , 370 , 000 . 00 deposited here in the u . k , i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless i instruct them to do so . i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as hsbc is concerned , the transaction with our late customer concluded when i sent the funds to corporate securities , all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process . corporate securities co has no single idea of what  s the history or nature of the deposit . they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward . this is the situation . this bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man  s family ; they have investigated for months and have found no family . the investigation has come to an end . my proposal ; you share similar details to the late fellow ; i am prepared to place you in a position to instruct corporate securities co to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation . upon receipt of the deposit , i am prepared to share the money with you in half . that is : i will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you . we share the proceeds 50 / 50 . i would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me , but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit . but on the other hand , you with the same very name as the original depositor would easily pass as the beneficiary with right to claim . i assure you that i could have the deposit released to you within a few days . i will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased i will then officially communicate with corporate securities co and instruct them to release the deposit to you . with these two things : all is done . the alternative would be for us to have corporate securities co direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder . this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from corporate securities co . we can fine - tune this based on our interactions . i am aware of the consequences of this proposal . i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail . i ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive . if my offer is of no appeal to you , delete this message and forget i ever contacted you . do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal . you may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector . i am not a criminal and what i do , i do not find against good conscience , this may be hard for you to understand , but the dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move . such opportunities only come ones ' way once in a lifetime . i cannot let this chance pass me by , for once i find myself in total control of my destiny . these chances wont pass me by . i ask that you do not destroy my chance , if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me . i am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities . there is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking . i have evaluated the risks and the only risk i have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank . i am the only one who knows of this situation , good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life . lets share the blessing . if you find yourself able to work with me , contact me through this same email account . if you give me positive signals , i will initiate this process towards a conclusion . i wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels ; i will deny knowing you and about this project . i repeat , i do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do i want you contacting me through my official email account . contact me only through the numbers i will provide for you and also through this email address . i do not want any direct link between you and me . my official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our total quality management policy . please observe this instruction religiously . please , again , note i am a family man , i have a wife and children . i send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences , but i know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold . this is the one truth i have learned from my private banking clients . do not betray my confidence . if we can be of one accord , we should plan a meeting , soon . i await your response . paul yorke . mail sent from webmail service at php - nuke powered site - http : / / vader . conspiracy - theory . org",Phishing Email

sections (or raw message text if no MIME exists); spammers could put
megabytes of other crap before that and it wouldn't even be looked at
(except that the email package has to parse non-text/* parts well enough to
skip over them, and tokens for the most interesting parts of Content-{Type,
Disposition, Transfer-Encoding} decorations are generated for all MIME
sections).Schemes that remain ignorant of MIME are vulnerable to spammers putting
arbitrary amounts of ""nice text"" in the preamble area (after the headers and
before the first MIME section), which most mail readers don't display, but
which appear first in the file so are latched on to by Graham's scoring
scheme.But I don't worry about clever spammers -- I've seen no evidence that they
exist <0.5 wink>.  Even if they do, the Open Source zoo is such that no

spammers in trying to fool just one scheme.  Even if they did, for the kind
of scheme we're using here they can't *know* what ""nice text"" is, not unless
they pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their
messages to each different one.  At that point they'd be doing targeted
marketing, and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously.if-you're-out-to-make-a-quick-buck-you-don't-waste-a-second-on-hard-

can not remember if alsaplayer needs a --rebuild.As an aside, alsaplayer is really maturing into a versitile app, I've been packaging
for many releases now.I've scripted the alsa-xmms cvs build, so it's easy to spin another one if these

"re : 5 . 1433 comparative method i re-read newmeyer 's original posting ( date 30 nov 94 ) and noticed that it has an implicit attack on the notion of "" basic word order "" for comparative purposes . this flows from his earlier question on how basic word order is variously defined by various analysts , implying that it lacks precision . to the extent that i have understood the responses so far , no one has responded to this particular point , so here goes - - basically in agreement with newmeyer , but with some criticism of the assumed larger implications for comparative reconstruction of syntax . i ' ll stick to what i know about linguistic events in europe since i expect the events to be more familiar to most readers than events in other language families , so that my examples may speak to readers ' previous ideas about particular linguistic events referred to below , and , under the best circumstances , provoke further discussion . to anticipate , the notion of basic word order is too simple-minded ( simplistic ? ) for diachronic purposes . fn : "" could anything resembling latin syntax be reconstructed through comparison of the syntax of the modern romance languages ? "" bw : should it ? the immediate ancestor of the romance languages is not latin but proto - romance . svo ? what about the exceptions , e . g . , french j ' ai rien fait etc . are n't they hints to certain historical complications . also aux inversion in standard french , e . g . , sont-ils venus ? standard french aux inversion is probably of germanic origin , not found elsewhere in romance . as for reconstruction of case ( cf . latin / english ) , with possible implications for earlier word order possibilities , case inflections remain on ( third person ) object clitics in all romance languages . when we consider deviations from svo word order in romance languages , we may suspect that the notion of "" basic "" word order is a villain to the extent that it invites the analyst to disregard less frequent or syntactically restricted word orders . this is not safe in internal reconstruction of syntax , while the most revealing procedure may be to do internal reconstruction of syntax within a language before using the comparative method to reconstruct within groups of languages genetically related by other criteria . in fact , the last point above is what is usually done , and is probably the only proper way to proceed , given the intent of the comparative method . always reconstruct a basic vocabulary first , on the basis of sound correspondences - - to justify genetic relationship among the languages . then consider syntactic comparison . problems with this necessary procedure will emerge in following discussion , but it remains necessary unless you want to reconstruct the syntactic evolution of a geographical area rather than of a genetic family . the latter may be a useful complement to assumed genetic reconstruction , but i think it is too digressive an idea for me to pursue below . now , what about preverbal object clitics in romance ? another hint of complications to the svo concept of romance . preverbal object clitic means ov - - but i suppose "" basic "" means when o has a noun not a pronoun as the head . and what aout the fixing of multiple object clitic order in romance ? e . g . , case order versus person ( inherent topicality ) order . that can't be reconstructed for latin because the clitics did not arise as distinct entities until proto - romance at the earliest . can a single or preferred clitic order be reconstructed for proto - romance , e . g . , dat-acc ( invariant in spanish and , i think , rumanian , but acc-dat seems to be older in french , now remaining only for third persons , i . e . , no inherent topicality difference therefore earlier case ordering remains - - french acc-dat may reflect germanic influence as well ? ) ? or did fixed clitic orders originally arise independently in various areas of romance ? in any case , how can we avoid the comparative method in addressing the problem of the origin of object clitic order in romance ? in sum , i think that the origin / s and evolution of fixed multiple object clitic orders in romance is a legitimate issue , and that it cannot be solved without recourse to the comparative method ( among others , of course ) . therefore , the comparative method cannot be dismissed in syntactic reconstruction . fn : "" should we therefore reconstruct proto - germanic ( almost surely incorrectly ) as svo ? "" bw : newmeyer 's reference to proto - germanic reveals even more than romance that "" basic "" word order is a villainous concept for reconstruction in this case , as if "" basic "" word orders can be compared across related languages to reconstruct "" proto-basic "" word orders , such that "" minor "" word orders can be ignored or reconstructed as "" proto-minor "" word orders . one principle which emerges from our knowledge of the historical record is that word order change does n't work that way , i . e . , word orders cannot be compartmentalized as "" basic "" and "" minor "" for diachronic purposes . principle : if we want to develop tools and principles for syntactic reconstruction , we will really have to consider the functions served by the various word orders at different times , and detect changes in their functions diachronically . in other words , word order change in a language must be studied in the context of the totality of functions of all its word orders at any given time . the difference between such a study and the study of change in "" basic "" word order , if the latter means anything at all , is analogous to the study of phonetic change and phonemic change . if analysts argue about the notion of "" basic "" word order , this is analogous to arguing about different concepts of the phoneme , and not about agreed upon linguistic facts . the fallacy of reconstructing "" basic "" word order for proto - germanic on the basis of the "" basic "" word order in current germanic becomes obvious according to the above principle because of the sov word order in subordinate clauses in continental germanic . and even this is not as invariant a property of the oldest texts as it is of the later standardised languages , e . g . , before middle german and dutch . english also clues us in to inversion by its many remnants , even without historical texts which reveal more similarities to continental germanic , e . g . , v - first following a subordinate clause or adverb , still common in the av bible . including english but excluding gothic which mirrors to the extent possible the new testament greek syntax from which it was translated , the earliest texts in germanic show , as far as i know , a tendency relatively favorable to verb-final in subordinate clauses , but much variation , later eliminated in the continental standards . this leads to arguments about whether or not the sov tendency was the break-up of an earlier more general indo - european sov tendency ( or earlier fixation ? ) which died in english and scandinavian ( including the still highly inflected icelandic - - creating problems even for simplistic functional arguments for the evolution of svo in germanic , so that the argument would have to be : it started as a reaction to the increasing unreliability of case distinction but spread for social reasons to languages that did n't need it . such an argument does not strike me as at all unreasonable ! ) . [ although i excluded gothic above , because of its malleable accommodation to greek syntax , its deviations from nt greek are quite revealing . most salient is the absence of a definite article , despite its occurrence in nt greek as well as in all other germanic languages . if gothic translation was totally serious about imitating nt greek syntax in all cases it could have adopted an unstressed demonstrative to imitate the greek article , as later germanic did ( in a sense ) . the most important question about gothic syntax is : is the malleability of its syntax innovative from proto - germanic ? - - if so , we will probably never know in what ways the gothic translations of nt greek stretched the limits of that malleability , and distorted the colloquial functions of word order in spoken gothic or more generally in the germanic of the third century . if sov was invariant in some ancestor , then why did it deteriorate in germanic ? at least as puzzling , how / why / when did germanic get aux inversion , even in yes / no questions . all indo - european languages show wh fronting for wh questions , so is there any reason to believe the proto - language did not . would i be buying what newmeyer is questioning with the preceding argument , cf . fn : "" i have the impression that with increasing frequency , one comes across statements such as the following in the literature : "" most of the attested languages in language family x have some syntactic property . therefore we can assume that proto - x had this property . "" "" bw : [ why with "" increasing frequency "" ? is the implication that copy-cat historical linguists are becoming less responsible than they used to be ( cf . the discussion of the spread of rumors about the number of eskimo words for snow ) , or that syntax is driving historical linguistics to pot ? ] to be safe , i guess ancillary arguments come in , like : considering how areally widespread the ie languages are , is it likely that the unanimity of wh first questions across ie is not reflective of the proto-language ? ok , so maybe wh fronting is proto - ie ( got a better explanation for the facts ? or reason to ignore them ? ) , but why aux inversion in germanic questions . and does the application of inversion to yes / no questions mean that there was a question marker in initial position ( wh question position ) with yes / no questions , as in "" what / hullo , are you kidding me ? "" ( such a marker "" ibai "" is found in gothic whenever the new testament greek original has "" me : "" ) . do n't get me wrong . i ' m not suggesting that an initial yes / no question-marker was a necessary condition for the inversion innovation in germanic . i ' m only observing that there was the option of such a marker , and anticipating ( if indeed it has not already been suggested ) that some analysts who are overly formal in their approaches to syntax might suppose the necessity of such a marker to motivate a mechanical generalisation of inversion from wh to yes / no questions . again , because such in - version occurs in all germanic should we not reconstruct it for proto - germanic . . qualification on all : it 's variable in gothic where it 's variable in nt greek : pronoun subjects usually do not invert with the verb , noun subjects usually do . ] a practical point is that , as far as i know , there is an issue about the differentiation of germanic into anything like the modern descendents before the 4 - 5th century . thus , if aux inversion goes back that far , does it matter if it spread from one germanic area to another or if it was part of proto - ( west ? ) germanic ? all innovations must spread before we recognise them as innovations in the language ( or dialect ) . historical linguistics does not study the evolution of the idiolect ( if such a concept as "" evolution of the idiolect "" is even coherent ) . finally , about typological arguments . when morphology-as - fossilized syntax and universal-typology of word order congealed in the early 1970s , some suggested that even before ie was sov it was vso . why ? because subject marking inflection follows the verb : v - s , get it ? inevitably , then , some suggested that celtic maintains the most archaic "" basic "" word order among the ie languages . this is another excess in diachronic application of ( whatever ) the notion of basic word order . the principal objection raised was that it is not obvious ( and even unlikely ) that only basic word orders morphologise . ( in fact , they may be least likely to morphologise . ) considering that s represents an unstressed anaphor in v - s , s might be in a minor word order position . [ and note that if basic word order means when the arguments are nominal , not pronominal , then discourse frequency is not criterial of basic , since at least most subject arguments are pronominal , if not merely inflectional . furthermore , if "" basic "" only counts the relative frequency of subject nominals , it is based on something which is quite rare in discourse : subject nominals ] . in any case , subject inflection following the verb stem is a widespread eurasian areal feature , extending into africa in semitic and various other branches of afro - asiatic . to some this might be taken as a clue to the correctness of nostratic and other super-family notions , to others an indication of an extremely old innovation having spread ( over millenia ? ) across families regardless of genetic relationship ( cf . the famous balkan area ) . still others might opt for coincidence . various other languages also have this feature , e . g . , kanuri in west africa and various new world languages . ( welcome to nostratic ? ) questions about the functions of position after the verb in so-called sov languages are raised by v - s inflectional order . the typological implications of this go beyond my current knowledge , although i dimly remember that various eurasian sov languages are different according to whether or what function post-verb - al position has in such languages . this is obvious , for example , in the contrast between eurasian sov languages ( with differences amongst themselves ) and the so-called sovx west african languages , where x is an adpositional phrase ( with complications about the origin of adpositional phrases in such languages which i will refrain from discussing here ) . since so many eurasian sov languages are also v - s inflectional languages , i do not know if there are sov languages which have a "" minor "" postverbal position for an anaphoric subject ( such that it turns up in other positions in certain constructions , so that we can demonstrate that it is not an inflection ) . maybe typology of relevant amerind languages will help solve this problem . but maybe we may also anticipate the reappearance of the party-spoiling question about the representativeness of curent language types to possible ( and former ) language types . no doubt an unwelcome ( and unhelpful ? ) thought to many . in this context it seems worth mentioning that mathematical probability arguments for various word orders , as i have seen them practiced , are not impressive , because of faults in their initial assumptions . for example , as far as i know , they invariably assume the validity of counting number of languages , regardless of the genetic relationship or areal contiguity of the languages counted . this seems unsound to me , particularly ignoring areal contiguity . for example , we find ( i think ) that the eurasian area , consisting of umpteen and umpred languages , has s . . . o word order ( ignoring the position of the verb as an independent variable ) . then in the new world we find large areas of contiguous s . . . o order , and separate areas of o . . . s order . maybe we should be calculating mathematical probability on the basis of contiguous area rather than number of languages . the surprising result might be that o . . . s is more probable than s . . . o ( where area is an independent variable , not individual language , of course . ) i ' m not sure what the implications of this might be , but one might be that o . . . s might have once been a more likely ordering strategy than it is now , and that the predominance of s . . . o across languages counted individually is largely the result of areal spread . [ if the spread of s . . . o is old enough , its predominance might even be the result of an absolute increase in the number of "" languages "" in the world all together . however , this is n't really relevant to my criticim of the way probability arguments have been applied to syntactic typology , only to the historical implications of adequate assumptions about language typology . in fact , i ' ll leave this discussion with the already widely accepted suggestion that strategies for information distribution in the clause , esp . in terms of old / new , are more relevant to typology than such problematic notions for cross-linguistic comparison as subject and object . similarly , for example , i think that in eurasia , agent . . . patient / theme order largely cuts across ergative and accusative languages , even though ergative languages would have patient / theme , or whatever term you want , as subject . to this extent , s . . . o cannot be universal even in eurasia , without confusing "" accusative "" definitions of subject and object , where subject status is consistent with case-marking , and "" ergative "" definitions , where case-marking is more closely tied to transitivity role than to the mushy cross-linguistic concept of subject . ] fn : "" and furthermore , syntactic change can be fairly catyclysmic , restructuring grammars wholesale in one generation - - unlikely or impossible with phonological systems . "" bw : i think the thrust of fn 's suggestion here is largely right , though probably vastly overstated ( on the basis of older ideas about creoles ? ) . however , questions remain in my mind about conditions under which these things happen . within monolingual areas ( or among closely related , mutually intelligible languages , ( certain types of ? ) syntactic strategies seem to have the potential to spead quite quickly , perhaps almost as quickly as new words and expressions , while comparable speed is not generally observed for phonological change ( and is probably "" unlikely or impossible "" , as newmeyer puts it , for both internal linguistic and social reasons - - in fact , i think "" unlikely "" is more accurate than "" impossible "" depending on the nature of the particular type of phonological change , and i have an example of possible single-generation phonological change in the current english of the african americans in new york city area , but i do not have sufficient data to make this possibility or its implications worth discussing here - - until i get to the section in labov 's new book where he discusses recent innovations in the chicago vowel system i will not be sure if he has other examples ) . however , to the extent that language-contact propels "" cataclysmic "" syntactic change ( in the historical record ) fn 's suggestion is not so clear . for example , english in east la ( a mexican american community ) is more immediately strikingingly different from adjacent english dialects on the phonological than on the syntactic level . and that applies to monolingual speakers of east la english as well as spanish - english bilinguals , and to various phonological segments as well as intonational contours ] . in understanding historical syntactic evolution , it is most often difficult to distinguish internal evolution from language contact ( hence the sour regard for substratal theories during the late 19th - to-mid 20th c celebration of neogrammarian achievements ) - - and then there is also jakobson 's caution that language contact might not permit evoluton that is not internally possible anyway , rather that it can only promote one possible direction of change as opposed to other possible directions which might flourish under other external circumstances . this too i consider problematic as a blanket statement , but a major consideration to keep in mind as a possible constraint on change in most reconstructive expeditions into the unknown past . enough . these are my thoughts about the problems of using the comparative method alone to reconstruct syntax . but nobody would suggest something so foolish as not enlisting all possible tools of reconstruction , including internal and typological in addition to comparative . conversely , it would be equally foolish to shun the comparative method as a reconstructive tool . in any case , the notion of basic word order is not helpful to syntactic reconstruction , if not of doubtful value as an autonomous observation about the synchronic state of any language as well . i mean it 's ok to observe that english and french are both synchronically svo ( spoken french even more than english - - not least because of the former 's preferred question formation strategies ) , but without further discussion that does not mean that their syntaxes are "" basically "" the same , in any insightful or interesting ( to coin an adjective ) sense . i would like readers to react to any of the points i have made above , not least of all the accuracy of the facts i have suggested for various languages , since i am not an expert in the areas of most of the facts i have presented , e . g . , current typological theory , indo - european linguistics , eurasian and new world areal syntactic characteristics . benji",Safe Email
