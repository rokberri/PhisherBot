"http://www.irishnews.com/access/daily/current.asp?SID=421083Loo rolls of honour and the invisible manPaper Clips: A round-up of the weekly pressBy Steven McCafferyThe powers-that-be tell us that crime does not pay. And they found an 
ally in the Ulster Herald this week, which carries a cautionary tale 
for anyone thinking of embarking on a criminal career. The 
Omagh-based paper's 'As the Man Says' column brings a story which 
originated in the Middle East.""A gent recently attempted to rob a bank in Tehran,"" the columnist reports.""He was unarmed and began seizing bank notes from customers' hands.""It is then explained: ""He had paid Â£625 to a local sorcerer and 
believed that he was invisible.""In the Lurgan Mail there was also news of a dramatic robbery.""A Lurgan newsagent has told how thieves drilled their way through 
three walls to steal Â£10,000 worth of cigarettes recently in an 
attack which was well planned and professional,"" the paper reports.""The thieves broke through the back wall of a religious gifts shop 
next door to the newsagents and then drilled through the partition 
between the back hallway and the front shop.""Moving statues of religious icons out of the way, the gang then 
drilled into the back of the newsagent's cigarette stand removing the 
contents.""The owner of the Paper Chase shop is pictured next to the gaping hole 
left in his store and is quoted as saying: ""On Monday morning when my 
wife was opening, everything looked normal.""But when she opened the shutters she found herself looking into the 
shop next door.""The paper reports that the shop was the target of ""another well 
organised crime"" 12 weeks ago when thieves escaped with a safe.The shop's owner says: ""The closer it gets to Christmas the more 
people are going to be open to this.""The issues of crime and punishment are tackled by a columnist in the 
Down Democrat.Writing in the Downpatrick-based newspaper John Coulter calls on the 
authorities to ""birch the vandals"" plaguing the local community.He is shocked at reports of the ""wanton destruction by vandals"" and 
issues a call for action.""The time has come to fight fire with fire,"" he writes, ""before 
unemployed paramilitaries decide to impose vigilante rule and start 
using so-called kangaroo courts to dish out their own brand of 
sentences on those found 'guilty' of anti-social behaviour.""As an alternative to such reckless violence, he recommends, 
controlled violence.""It was a sorry day that the Manx authorities banned the use of the 
birch as a weapon in dealing with unruly elements of the Isle of Man.""Getting his defence in early, he immediately rounds on any woolly 
liberal who may oppose his plan.""In many Islamic countries, public flogging of convicted criminals is 
the order of the day.""You might laugh and say there is little chance of such measures 
being introduced in the United Kingdom or Ireland given that corporal 
punishment was abolished in the vast majority of northern schools in 
the late 1980s.""However, people seem to forget that Islam is the fastest growing 
faith on the British mainland and it's only a matter of time before 
it numerically passes Christianity.""

"> Bottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have 
> endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he 
> ever coined it.An interesting link courtesy of the Harrow Report: there's no written 
evidence so far that Senator Everett Dirksen is the source of the 
infamous quote attributed to him. It's kind of astounding that there is 
enough general social consensus (25% of all queries makes it a *very* 
FAQ) and ""eyewitness"" reporting without a single written source. What 
the essay below doesn't seem to answer, though, is what the earliest 
attributed quote in print by any other writer is. I'd naturally be much 
more skeptical if the ""quote"" emerged after his death... RK===============================================================
http://www.dirksencenter.org/featuresBillionHere.htm""A billion here, a billion there . . .""Did Dirksen ever say, "" A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon 
you're talking real money""? (or anything very close to that?)Perhaps not. Based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio 
records of The Dirksen Congressional Center, staffers there have found 
no evidence that Dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to 
him.Archivists undertook the search after studying research statistics 
showing that more than 25 percent of inquiries have to do with the quote 
or its variations.Here is what they examined: all of the existing audio tapes of the famed 
""Ev and Charlie"" and ""Ev and Jerry"" shows, all newspapers clippings in 
the Dirksen Papers, about 12,500 pages of Dirksen's own speech notes, 
transcripts of his speeches and media appearances, transcripts of 
Republican leadership press conferences, and Dirksen's statements on the 
Senate floor as documented in the Congressional Record.Although Dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech, preferring to 
rely on notes, he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular 
turn of phrase. For example, in referring to the public debt or 
excessive government spending, Dirksen would jot the word ""pothole"" to 
remind him to tell the following story, on this occasion in reference to 
the debt ceiling:
""As I think of this bill, and the fact that the more progress we make 
the deeper we go into the hole, I am reminded of a group of men who were 
working on a street. They had dug quite a number of holes. When they got 
through, they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to 
the hole, and they had a nice little mound, which was quite a traffic 
hazard.""Not knowing what to do with it, they sat down on the curb and had a 
conference. After a while, one of the fellows snapped his fingers and 
said, â€˜I have it. I know how we will get rid of that overriding earth 
and remove the hazard. We will just dig the hole deeper.'"" 
[Congressional Record, June 16, 1965, p. 13884].
On the same occasion, Dirksen relied on yet another ""spending"" story, 
one he labeled ""cat in the well"":
""One time in the House of Representatives [a colleague] told me a story 
about a proposition that a teacher put to a boy. He said, â€˜Johnny, a cat 
fell in a well 100 feet deep. Suppose that cat climbed up 1 foot and 
then fell back 2 feet. How long would it take the cat to get out of the 
well?'""Johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a 
while, and then when the teacher came down and said, â€˜How are you 
getting along?' Johnny said, â€˜Teacher, if you give me another slate and 
a couple of slate pencils, I am pretty sure that in the next 30 minutes 
I can land that cat in hell.'""If some people get any cheer our of a $328 billion debt ceiling, I do 
not find much to cheer about concerning it."" [Congressional Record, June 
16, 1965, p. 13884].
But there are no such reminders for the ""A billion here, a billion 
there . . . "" tag line as there surely should have been given Dirksen's 
note-making tendencies. He spoke often and passionately about the debt 
ceiling, federal spending, and the growth of government. Yet there is no 
authoritative reference to the ""billion"" phrase.The chief evidence in support of Dirksen making the statement comes from 
people who claim to have heard him. The Library of Congress, for 
example, cites someone's personal observation on the campaign trail as 
evidence. The Dirksen Center has received calls from people who heard 
Dirksen say those words, some even providing the date of the event. But 
cross-checking that information with the records has, so far, turned up 
nothing in the way of confirmation.The closest documented statement came at a joint Senate-House Republican 
leadership press conference on March 8, 1962, when Dirksen said, ""The 
favorite sum of money is $1 billion â€“ a billion a year for a fatter 
federal payroll, a billion here, a billion there."" [EMD Papers, 
Republican Congressional Leadership File, f. 25] But the ""and pretty 
soon you're talking real money"" is missing.In another close call, the New York Times, January 23, 1961, quoted 
Dirksen: ""Look at education â€“ two-and-one-half billion â€“ a billion for 
this, a billion for that, a billion for something else. Three to five 
billion for public works. You haven't got any budget balance left. 
You'll be deeply in the red."" [Cited in Byron Hulsey's ""Everett Dirksen 
and the Modern Presidents,"" Ph.D. dissertation (May 1998, University of 
Texas, p. 226]Of course, the Dirksen Papers do not document completely the late 
Senator's comments. For example, The Center that bears his name does not 
have his testimony before committees. Their collection of Congressional 
Records ends in 1965, omitting the last four years of Dirksen's life and 
career â€“ he might have employed the phrase only late, although witnesses 
claim he said it throughout his career. Dirksen's campaign speeches 
tended not to produce transcripts, only sketchy notes or abbreviated 
newspaper accounts. Dirksen also held center stage before the video age, 
meaning that many remarks, particularly those in campaigns, escaped 
capture.Bottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have 
endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he 
ever coined it.Â Â

Wed Sep 4, 9:14 AM ETMISSAGLIA, Italy (Reuters) - Husband's eyes wandering? Make yourself sexier.
At least that's the solution proposed by an Italian mayor -- and a woman
mayor at that.Wives in the northern town of Missaglia had complained to mayor Marta
Casiraghi about a young woman who sunbathed topless on her terrace.They complained that the men in the town of some 7,000 people were spending
too much time ogling, so they asked Casiraghi to order the woman to put her
clothes back on.But the mayor, far from sympathizing, told the wives to get sexy if they
wanted to keep their men. ""The girl was very pretty and was soaking up some
sun. Topless sunbathing is largely tolerated and widespread nowadays.
There's nothing we can do,"" Casiraghi told Il Nuovo, a web-based newspaper.""Instead, I'd advise the wives to play their rival at her own game -- make
themselves more beautiful.""

for deep infrasound (pressure waves) with a network of stations designed 
to enforced the nuke test ban treaty we've discovered that pretty big 
impacts are the norm. Current infrasound stations can detect 
bolides/meteoroids in ~10 T TNT scale, but some 10 kT events are 
relatively frequent. A number of people died in the Tunguska event (1908, 
10-15 MT), despite it hitting in the middle of nowhere.http://216.239.39.100/search?q=cache:637JrhGDB5gC:www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/5thMars99/pdf/6081.pdf+bolide+impact+kT+wave&hl=en&ie=UTF-8In the Earth atmosphere a large number of bright light flashes of energies
in light impulse of about 0.1- 1 kt TNT and higher have been registered by
USA DoD satellites equipped with photoelectric detectors [9-11]. Intense
light impulses are created by impacts of meteoroids disrupted in the
atmosphere (mainly at altitudes of about 30-45 km). Several techniques for
the assessment of meteor- oid's characteristics from the light curves and
heights of peak intensities have been developed [3,12]. Using these
techniques the preatmospheric kinetic energy for Fifth International
Conference on Mars INITIATION OF SANDSTORMS: I.V.Nemtchinov, O.P.Popova,
V.A.Rybakov, V.V.Shuvalov a number of events was determined. The biggest
event is the 1 February 1994 with ini- tial energy as high as 30-40 kt TNT
(or initial mass of about 400 t). The bright flash with light energy of
about 4.5 kt TNT was caused by this meteoroid which deeply penetrated into
the atmosphere (at an angle of 45 degrees and velocity of 24 km/s) and
disintegrated above at altitudes of about 34 km and 21 km [9,12]. Another
famous impact event, the Sikhote-Alin meteor shower (12 February 1947
event), may be compared with the 1 February 1994 event. Initial masses of
these meteoroids are probably the same, as well as the angle of trajectory
inclination, but the initial velocity of the Sikhote-Alin is almost twice
smaller. That caused fragmentation of 1 February 1994 meteoroid at higher
altitudes and probably large fragments constitute a smaller part of the
pre- breakdown mass in contrast to the Sikhote-Alin event. In a rarefied
atmosphere of Mars analogous im- pactors will penetrate into deeper layers
of the atmos- phere.They will disintegrate lower 15 km or even reach the
planet surface, partially in disrupted form. Only the first disruption
would occur if a meteoroid similar to that caused the 1 February 1994 will
enter into the Martian atmosphere. And this body would reach the Mars
surface as a tense swarm of fragments. The meteoroid similar to that
caused the Sikhote-Alin event would hit the surface in a form of large
frag- ments due to its low velocity. They will create crater with the size
similar to that of the undisrupted meteoroid.

"addendum to coston 's object affixes in his summary of object affixes ( linguist list : vol-6 - 235 . fri 17 feb 1995 ) , simon corston observes : languages with object affixes but which lack affixes indicating other grammatical relations do occur , but would appear to be uncommon . that , however , really depends on what we mean by object affixes ( and subject affixes for that matter ) . so - called subject and object affixes fall into three types : ( i ) nonreferential / nonanaphoric agreement markers ; ( ii ) ' functionally ambiguous ' agreement markers ( i . e . functioning as both nonreferential / nonanaphoric agreement markers and anaphoric / referential markers depending on the context ) ( bresnan and mchombo 1987 ) ; and ( iii ) anaphoric or referential markers . the nuclear micronesian group provides an interesting case for the foregoing distinction . for instance , in woleaian , the subject markers are independent words , whereas the object markers are suffixes . but they are both functionally ambiguous agreement markers . in kusaiean , the subject and object markers are also independent words and suffixes , respectively . but they are all referential pronouns . for more detailed discussion of the nuclear micronesian languages see my paper : ' the verb - object bonding principle : with special reference to nuclear micronesian languages ' ( see refs below ) . if the complexity in subject and object affixes ( viz . the three types mentioned above ) is disregarded , probably corston 's observation may hold . but if only anaphoric / referential subject and object markers are taken into account , it may be a different story . in fact , in the same paper i have used a small convenience sample of 40 languages to ascertain whether the verb - object bonding principle ( as proposed in tomlin 1986 : ' a transitive verb and its object form a more cohesive , unified syntactic and semantic whole than do a transitive verb and its subject ' ) is evident in the pronominal system as well : e . g . object pronouns are more tightly bonded to the verb than subject pronouns are . the upshot of this investigation is that object pronouns ( e . g . affixes ) are more tightly bonded to the verb than subject pronouns ( e . g . independent words ) . this suggests that insofar as referential / anaphoric markers are concerned , ' languages with object affixes but which lack affixes indicating other grammatical relations ' may be crosslinguistically common , rather than uncommon . refereneces bresnan j . and s . mchombo 1987 . topic , pronoun , and agreement in chichewa . language 63 : 741-782 . givon , t . 1976 . topic , pronoun , and grammatical agreement . in subject and topic , ed . by c . n . li , pp . 149-188 . new york : academic press . tomlin , r . s . 1986 . basic word order : functional principles . london : croom helm . song , j . j . 1994 . the verb - object bonding principle : with special reference to nuclear micronesian languages . oceanic linguistics 33 . 2 ( in press ) . jae jung song university of otago new zealand",Safe Email
"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----CERT Advisory CA-2002-21 Vulnerability in PHP   Original release date: July 22, 2002
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.Systems Affected     * Systems running PHP versions 4.2.0 or 4.2.1Overview   A  vulnerability  has been discovered in PHP. This vulnerability could
   be  used  by  a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash PHP
   and/or the web server.I. Description   PHP  is  a  popular  scripting  language  in  widespread use. For more
   information about PHP, see          http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.general.php   The  vulnerability  occurs  in the portion of PHP code responsible for
   handling  file uploads, specifically multipart/form-data. By sending a
   specially  crafted  POST  request  to  the web server, an attacker can
   corrupt  the  internal  data  structures used by PHP. Specifically, an
   intruder  can  cause  an improperly initialized memory structure to be
   freed.  In  most  cases, an intruder can use this flaw to crash PHP or
   the  web  server. Under some circumstances, an intruder may be able to
   take  advantage  of  this  flaw  to  execute  arbitrary  code with the
   privileges of the web server.   You  may  be  aware that freeing memory at inappropriate times in some
   implementations  of  malloc  and  free  does not usually result in the
   execution  of  arbitrary  code.  However, because PHP utilizes its own
   memory  management  system,  the  implementation of malloc and free is
   irrelevant to this problem.   Stefan  Esser  of  e-matters  GmbH has indicated that intruders cannot
   execute   code   on   x86   systems.   However,  we  encourage  system
   administrators  to  apply  patches  on  x86  systems  as well to guard
   against denial-of-service attacks and as-yet-unknown attack techniques
   that may permit the execution of code on x86 architectures.   This  vulnerability  was discovered by e-matters GmbH and is described
   in  detail  in  their  advisory.  The  PHP  Group  has  also issued an
   advisory.  A list of vendors contacted by the CERT/CC and their status
   regarding this vulnerability is available in VU#929115.   Although   this  vulnerability  only  affects  PHP  4.2.0  and  4.2.1,
   e-matters  GmbH  has  previously  identified  vulnerabilities in older
   versions  of  PHP.  If  you  are  running  older  versions  of PHP, we
   encourage you to review
   http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012002.htmlII. Impact   A  remote  attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
   An  attacker  may not be able to execute code on x86 architectures due
   to  the way the stack is structured. However, an attacker can leverage
   this  vulnerability  to  crash PHP and/or the web server running on an
   x86 architecture.III. SolutionApply a patch from your vendor   Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory.
   As  vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we will update this
   section  and note the changes in our revision history. If a particular
   vendor  is  not  listed  below,  we  have not received their comments.
   Please contact your vendor directly.Upgrade to the latest version of PHP   If  a  patch  is  not  available  from your vendor, upgrade to version
   4.2.2.Deny POST requests   Until  patches  or an update can be applied, you may wish to deny POST
   requests.  The  following  workaround  is  taken from the PHP Security
   Advisory:     If  the  PHP  applications on an affected web server do not rely on
     HTTP POST input from user agents, it is often possible to deny POST
     requests on the web server.     In  the  Apache  web server, for example, this is possible with the
     following  code  included  in  the  main  configuration  file  or a
     top-level .htaccess file:     
        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
          Note  that an existing configuration and/or .htaccess file may have
     parameters contradicting the example given above.Disable vulnerable service   Until  you  can upgrade or apply patches, you may wish to disable PHP.
   As a best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling all services that
   are not explicitly required. Before deciding to disable PHP, carefully
   consider your service requirements.Appendix A. - Vendor Information   This  appendix  contains  information  provided  by  vendors  for this
   advisory.  As  vendors  report new information to the CERT/CC, we will
   update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a
   particular  vendor  is  not  listed  below, we have not received their
   comments.Apple Computer Inc.          Mac  OS  X  and  Mac  OS X Server are shipping with PHP version
          4.1.2  which  does  not  contain the vulnerability described in
          this alert.Caldera          Caldera  OpenLinux  does  not provide either vulnerable version
          (4.2.0,  4.2.1)  of  PHP  in their products. Therefore, Caldera
          products are not vulnerable to this issue.Compaq Computer Corporation          SOURCE:  Compaq Computer Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary
          of  Hewlett-Packard  Company  and  Hewlett-Packard  Company  HP
          Services Software Security Response Team
          x-ref: SSRT2300 php post requests
          At  the  time  of  writing  this  document, Compaq is currently
          investigating   the   potential  impact  to  Compaq's  released
          Operating System software products.
          As  further  information  becomes available Compaq will provide
          notice  of  the  availability  of any necessary patches through
          standard  security bulletin announcements and be available from
          your normal HP Services supportchannel.Cray Inc.          Cray, Inc. does not supply PHP on any of its systems.Debian          Debian GNU/Linux stable aka 3.0 is not vulnerable.
          Debian GNU/Linux testing is not vulnerable.
          Debian GNU/Linux unstable is vulnerable.
          The  problem  effects PHP versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1. Woody ships
          an  older  version  of  PHP  (4.1.2),  that doesn't contain the
          vulnerable function.FreeBSD          FreeBSD  does not include any version of PHP by default, and so
          is  not  vulnerable; however, the FreeBSD Ports Collection does
          contain  the  PHP4  package. Updates to the PHP4 package are in
          progress  and a corrected package will be available in the near
          future.Guardian Digital          Guardian  Digital  has not shipped PHP 4.2.x in any versions of
          EnGarde, therefore we are not believed to be vulnerable at this
          time.Hewlett-Packard Company          SOURCE:  Hewlett-Packard Company Security Response Team
          At  the  time  of  writing  this  document,  Hewlett Packard is
          currently  investigating  the potential impact to HP's released
          Operating System software products.
          As further information becomes available HP will provide notice
          of  the  availability of any necessary patches through standard
          security  bulletin  announcements  and  be  available from your
          normal HP Services support channel.IBM          IBM  is  not vulnerable to the above vulnerabilities in PHP. We
          do  supply the PHP packages for AIX through the AIX Toolbox for
          Linux  Applications.  However,  these packages are at 4.0.6 and
          also incorporate the security patch from 2/27/2002.Mandrakesoft          Mandrake Linux does not ship with PHP version 4.2.x and as such
          is  not  vulnerable.  The  Mandrake Linux cooker does currently
          contain  PHP  4.2.1  and  will  be  updated shortly, but cooker
          should  not be used in a production environment and no advisory
          will be issued.Microsoft Corporation          Microsoft  products  are not affected by the issues detailed in
          this advisory.Network Appliance          No Netapp products are vulnerable to this.Red Hat Inc.          None  of  our commercial releases ship with vulnerable versions
          of PHP (4.2.0, 4.2.1).SuSE Inc.          SuSE Linux is not vulnerable to this problem, as we do not ship
          PHP 4.2.x.

"organizational changes we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes are intended to accomplish four key objectives : first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe . this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position . second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units has become increasingly difficult . third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding asset positions . and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities . enron wholesale services today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets . enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below . mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley , currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office of the chairman as president and chief operating officer . providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership positions : rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will report to the ews office of the chairman . sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business into enron global assets in the near future . diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to the ebs office of the chairman . jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the transition , jim will join ees . in addition to these changes in our international asset operations activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale businesses and the commercial support functions : enron net works louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg . enron americas concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading , marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron americas . enron europe the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer . enron global markets enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance , equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products . enron industrial markets enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon , president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged . commercial support for ews the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by , the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews . to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these newly defined roles are as follows : mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works , with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated services organization with it and e -

"I saw your email on a website I visited yesterday, and thought
you might be interested in this. A few months back I joined a program and then...promptly forgot
about it. You may have done this yourself sometime...you intend
to work the program but then get caught in your day-to-day
activities and it's soon forgotten.The program was free to join so maybe I just didn't take it very
seriously.Anyway, near the end of May I received a letter from my
sponsor (Vic Patalano) informing me that I had more than 2000
PAID members in my downline!As you can imagine, I was very skeptical. After all, how could I
have more than 2000 paid members under me in a program that I had
never promoted?I took the time to check out the site...then wrote to Vic asking
for confirmation that these were paid members and not just free
sign-ups...like me :)Well, it was true...I had 2365 paid members in my downline. This
in a program that I had never worked!All I had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end
of the month and I would have my position locked in and a
downline of 2365 people.You can bet I wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!I can tell you, if I had known what was happening with this
program, I would have become an active paid member months ago!With this program, you will get a HUGE downline of PAID MEMBERS.
My sponsor's check, which is a minimum of $5,000, arrives every
month...on time.How would you like to lock your position in FREE while you check
out this opportunity and watch your downline grow?To grab a FREE ID#, simply reply to:gitrman@excite.com
and write this phrase:
""Email me details about the club's business and consumer opportunities""
Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your Free Member Number.I'll get you entered and let you know how you can
keep track of your growing downline.That's all there's to it.I'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.Warm regards,Bruce StevensP.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This company is different--it offers value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE. All you need to do is get your free
membership.

"human and non - human languages bearing on the question of primate language skills is the observation that they appear not to imitate the * manner * of doing something - - controverting the "" monkey see , monkey do "" saw . a clue as to why people have cultures and languages and primates do not came up in a national geographic series on primate research that i saw a few weeks ago . they had shown some chimps using sticks to poke through holes in a "" beehive "" and suck off honey , introducing the topic of tool use . in the next segment , the researcher had some candy on a table surrounded by some sort of cage with vertical bars . he had a primitive kind of rake with three wide-spaced tines resting on the table , the handle through the bars . the chimp had the same , on an adjacent section of the table . if the tines were down , they could n't get the candy because the wide-spaced tines could n't retain it . the researcher demonstrated flipping the rake over . with the back of the rake on the table top , it was easy to pull the candy to one 's hand . no matter how often he saw it , the chimp did n't get it . the inference from this and other experiments was that the primate perceives use of the tool to accomplish the end , but does not attend to the manner of using the tool . in the next segment , there is a similar setup with a small child . the child fails with the tines down . then the adult demonstrates flipping his rake over . the child immediately , on the next turn , does the same , even moving the rake through a curving path very much like that executed by the adult 's rake , to capture the object ( a block ) and pull it back to the edge . in support of this hypothesis , i believe there are no observations of cultural differences between one community of primates and another comparable to differences of human "" body language "" style and linguistic dialect - - differences in the manner of doing the "" same "" things , functionally inconsequential differences such that "" we "" do these things this way and "" they "" do the same things that way . bruce nevin bn @ lightstream . com",Safe Email

openssl. What version of openssh do you have? Is it an official Red Hat
package? I suppose it isn't, and using Red Hat's rpms will solve your
problem.What you need to know for openssl is :
0.9.5b is libcrypto.so.0 and libssl.so.0
0.9.6  is libcrypto.so.1 and libssl.so.1
0.9.6b is libcrypto.so.2 and libssl.so.2Now in all Red Hat packages I've seen so far, the only dependency is on
those files and not on ""openssl = version"".Matthias--

"Hi,Four of the IE nameservers are publishing out of date DNS information.
The four listed below are publishing the IE zone from last Friday.
They are six days behind reality. 192.16.202.11    NS.EU.NET.
 192.93.0.4       NS2.NIC.FR.
 198.133.199.102  GNS1.DOMAINREGISTRY.IE.
 198.133.199.103  GNS2.DOMAINREGISTRY.IE.The upshot of this is that correct DNS resolution for IE DNS data that
has been added or updated since last Friday is going to be 
intermittant. If you're lucky your resolver will query one of the five
nameservers that are publishing an up-to-date zone. Unfortunately, five
out of nine aren't good odds.Don't forget, if you lose the gamble your resolver is going to cache
the bad data for up to two days.If you're a user of BIND 8 or BIND 9 you could add	blackhole {
		192.16.202.11;
		192.93.0.4;
		198.133.199.102;
		198.133.199.103;
	};to your named.conf and restart BIND to avoid query the bad nameservers.
This will prevent _any_ queries to those servers.Putting	16.1.0.18
	204.123.2.18
	16.1.0.19
	192.111.39.100
	212.17.32.2
	193.1.142.2in /service/dnscache/root/servers/ie and restarting dnscache will
have the same result for dnscache users.

"workshop annoncement and call for papers - clitics workshop announcement and call for papers c l i t i c s 24th - 26th february 1999 konstanz university , germany we are pleased to announce our workshop on ' clitics ' during the 21st annual meeting of the german society of linguistics in konstanz ( germany ) . in linguistic research , clitics play an increasingly prominent role . the status of clitics is under discussion in phonology , morphology , and syntax , as well as in the respective interfaces . in these fields , the discussion on clitics gives rise to controversial analyses . one open question is whether we need in fact a separate linguistic category ' clitic ' , or whether these elements can be subsumed under different linguistic categories , such as affixes . - with respect to phonology , it is undetermined how clitics are incorporated into phonological structure . should we distinguish a clitic group in the prosodic hierarchy , are clitics part of prosodic words , or are they left outside prosodic structure ? how is their phonological deficiency best accounted for ? - concerning the morphology of clitics , especially regarding the occurrence of opaque clitics in clitic clusters , analyses within the framework of distributed morphology compete with those which propose an optimality theoretic solution . - also , the morphosyntactic status of clitics is unclear . is it possible to capture the order of clitics in clitic clusters in a more explanatory way than in terms of templates ? the complex conditions on clitic doubling give rise to the question whether clitics should be analysed as agreement markers or as arguments . - syntactic aspects of clitics play a major role in recent analyses in different theoretical frameworks . for instance , there is no agreement on the explanation of clitic climbing and it is an unsettled issue whether clitic placement should be accounted for in a syntactic , prosodic , prosodic-syntactic , or optimality-theoretic approach . the workshop intends to bring together phonologists , morphologists , and syntacticians and provides an ideal opportunity to share insights and to discuss the issues mentioned above . in addition to the invited speaker presentations , there are 9 slots for 30 - minute presentations , and 3 slots for 1 hour presentations ( including discussion ) . invited speakers : geert booij ( free university amsterdam ) jane grimshaw ( rutgers university ) juan uriagereka ( university of maryland ) please send a one-page abstract before 15th august 1998 to : birgit gerlach & janet grijzenhout , seminar fuer allgemeine sprachwissenschaft , heinrich - heine - universitaet , universitaetsstr . 1 , 40225 duesseldorf , germany . we may be contacted by e-mail at gerlach @ phil-fak . uni-duesseldorf . de , or grijzenh @ phil-fak . uni-duesseldorf . de",Safe Email

kids are put in front of the television for hours each day, to be 
influenced by what the media and government thinks is important.  I 
learned a long time ago that what they think is important and what is are 
two different things.  I threw the TV out when Xi was 9.  She's got her 
own place now, and still doesn't have one.  YaY!  Another thing that's 
wrong is what goes on in public schools.  Some allow a bit of 
individuality, but only for a class or a short period of time, depending 
on the teachers, most of the time.  I dunno how many times I've seen Xi 
come home from school absolutely miserable or outraged about something 
that happened at school.  She made it to college, though, whew.  It's a 
big problem to tackle, and I don't know the answer.  I like the idea of 
the voucher system, because in a way it is a way parents can vote more 
efficiently for how their kids are taught.

( vnbl . ob ) is a holding company , which is identifying and acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services to provide long term growth for its shareholders . vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in the security sector is unprecedented . the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2 ool have changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in the banking , healthcare and government sectors . while the focus for vinoble is on north america , the opportunity for security services is worldwide . according to giga , a wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by 2005 . vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security market by delivering professional services , security products , security training , and managed security services . in pursuit of this objective , vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals offering a full range of security services . through vinoble ' s consulting services and integrated delivery solutions , vinoble will help organizations protect key assets including persons , property , information , brand , and reputation . homeland security , the national strategy for a secure cyberspace , the healthcare insurance portability and accountability act ( hipaa ) , sarbanes - oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued increase in security demands in the united states and abroad . vinoble intends to position itself as the ' most desired ' provider of , both , physical and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients , alliance partners , and peers . we will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are the most knowledgeable , agile , professional , and cost - conscious provider of ' tailored ' security solutions to meet the unique needs of each client . management has partnered with garcyco capital corp . ( gccc ) to assist in finding acquisition candidates for the company , structuring such acquisitions , and effecting a transition to corporate growth . at present , vinoble and gccc have targeted several companies as potential acquisition candidates . pending the outcome of due diligence and audits , the company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis required for listing on a national exchange . here is recent news on the company : malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - may 20 , 2 oo 5 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb : vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services , is pleased to announce that as it continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition of assets , businesses , and strategic partners in the rfid and gps tracking sector , vinoble has further engaged with several additional businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology , software , and patents . following the move to acquire rfid ( radio frequency identification ) technology , hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use applications , the company has concluded that the need for application support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the framework which operates such technology . the company has identified several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software , and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element . middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications , both internally and externally , to the enterprise . this typically involves routing data using different transport protocols , translating data into different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as web services and service - oriented architectures . since rfid is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and non - mobile assets , user - friendly and efficient management software enabling customers to manage rfid data both incoming and out - bound is important in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with customer service . management software will allow for real time visibility of assets or product inventory , whether in transit , in a warehouse , at the manufacturing plant , or on a store shelf . visibility and accuracy will enable customers to reduce handling costs , gain instant access to shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply chain . the ability to manage data collection from a number of different rfid and gps devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system . the company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology will be essential and will further position vinoble in the vastly growing rfid and gps tracking industry . the company ' s goal is to provide critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of their personnel and assets in this current state of constant threat . safe harbor statement : this press release contains forward - looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 ( the act ) . in particular , when used in the preceding discussion , the words plan , confident that , believe , scheduled , expect , or intend to , and similar conditional expressions are intended to identify forward - looking statements within the meaning of the act and are subject to the safe harbor created by the act . such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties , and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward - looking statement . such risks and uncertainties include , but are not limited to , the ability of vinoble to complete the proposed acquisition ( s ) , the results of vinoble ' s due diligence review of the candidate ( s ) , the success of the business of the acquisition candidate ( s ) , including the ability of vinoble to continue to sell the applicable products and the acceptance of those newly designed products by the market , market conditions , the general acceptance of the company ' s products and technologies , competitive factors , timing , and other risks described in the company ' s sec reports and filings . the closing of the transaction will be subject to complete due diligence , inspections , and completion of audited financial statements in accordance to gaap as required by the sec prior to consummation . we believe the speculative near term target price is - $ o . 50 we believe the speculative long term target price - $ 4 . 00 we feel this is our best pick since december of 2 oo 4 !

It seems that something changed during the last 3-4 weeks.1) In a folder, msgs 1-n is read, n=current, n upwards is unread.
2) change to another folder
3) change back to the original folder and you'll see msg n+1 being 
highlighted as current for a split second, that it changes back to 
n=current.Kind of annoying since it marks msg n+1 as read./Anders_______________________________________________

"200 summary on reduplication a month before christmas ( in linguist vol-5 - 1354 ) i sent out a query about * reduplication * and how this strategy is grammaticalized in languages to convey some facet of * intensification * . this is a summary based on the 45 replies i received from linguist netters . allow me to thank you all collectively now , since i will not be referring to single respondents in the following discussion . the topic of reduplication interests me because i am writing on my phd on repetition with respect to intensification and iconicity in swedish . the point of departure in the original query were the claims found in lakoff & johnson ( metaphors we live by ; 1980 ) according to which reduplication may indicate : - plural or collective - intensification or increase - continuation or completion - diminution thus , ' more ' of physical linguistic ' form ' corresponds to ' more ' in the ' content ' of the reduplicated expression as opposed to a non-reduplicated form - - as an instance of diagrammatic iconicity ( or as a realization of the * conduit * metaphor in the terms of lakoff & johnson ) . there are reflections of the outlined principles in colloquial english in expressions like ' an old old man ' , ' the music got louder and louder ' , 's he talks talks talks ' , ' the ball bounced and bounced ' , ' there 's forms forms forms forms ' , ' it was sinking down down ' , etc . i originally mentioned , however , that these structures were * marked * in a language like english . the choice of words was perhaps not so lucky . what i meant by "" marked "" is that even if we may think that such expressions are frequent in casual speech , they are rare in more constrained contexts . a less marked way of intensifying would probably be to use a specific intensifier or quantifier , e . g . ' a very old man ' , ' talks a lot ' . i hope no one will be offended by this simplistic analysis , it is only leading us a bit beside the point . ( for a comprehensive account on "" repetition in english "" , see persson 1974 , univ . of uppsala , sw . ) i was in my query more after pointers to and examples of languages where reduplication as a means of * intensification * is an integrated , so to speak , a standard characteristic of the grammar . this was also , more or less , what i got . i will summarize the outcome in the following ; i am aware of that in most instances the "" facts "" are probably subject to qualification , but for the sake of clarity & brevity i will lay the examples ahead in a rather list-like manner . furthermore , the examples certainly represent only a sample of the languages in the world that have incorporated reduplication in their system . note that i have left out - - in order to make it all more illustrative - - possible tone marks and diacritics of the transliteration . 1 . plural or collective * in malay / bahasa ( indonesia ) , full word reduplication turns singular to plural : anak ' child ' anak-anak ' children ' * in nahuatl ( or "" aztec "" ) , prefixed reduplication with nouns conveys a plural meaning : cih-tli ' hare ' ( where ' cih - ' is the stem ) ci : cih-tli pl . - - moreover , there are no structurally distinct adjectives in nahuatl but certain "" adjectival "" suffixes that can take on a plural notion via reduplication : - pi : l diminutive suffix - pipi : l plural * hausa is cited to have reduplication in the formation of plurals of a limited set of nouns . * in japanese , reduplication may turn a noun to a collective , but the scope of this strategy is said to be marginal : hito ' person ' hitobito ' people ' kami ' god ' kamigami ' gods ' * in mandarin ( chinese ) , reduplication turns singular to collective ( but this is said to be rare ) : ren ' person ' renren ' people ' - - moreover , both in mandarin and cantonese * classifier * items may be reduplicated to convey "" universal quantification "" in contrast to more unique reference . this fits readily in the notion of intensification ( or augmentation ) : ge ren ' a person ' ( mandarin ) ge ge ren ' every person ' douh ' place , there ' ( cantonese ) douh-douh ' everywhere ' * dakotan patterns plurals of stative intransitive verbs with reduplication . this is said only to apply to instances with inanimate subjects though . north american languages in general may be of interest when considering reduplication but i am short of examples at present . following languages were mentioned in the replies , though : klamath , nez perce , sahaptin . 2 . intensification or increase * mandarin chinese intensifies adjectives with reduplication : xiao 's mall ' xiaoxiao ' very small ' gaoxing ' happy ' gaogaoxingxing ' very happy ' as you notice , with disyllabic adjectives the reduplication pattern is aabb . - - cantonese also uses reduplication for augmentation or emphasis . * turkish is , apparently , a point in case . reduplication of adjectives indicates intensification or increase in the following way : temiz ' clean ' tertemiz ' very clean ' dolu ' full ' dopdolu ' very full ' bos ' empty ' bosbos ' completely empty ' here we have prefixed reduplication accompanied with a binding consonant . interestingly , there do not seem to be "" rules "" for which binding consonant should be inserted in a given case . * hausa is cited to use reduplication in the intensification of adjectives . * celtic languages have full word reduplication to indicate intensification . the method is reminiscent of the case of english , but it may be more "" integrated "" in the grammar of the celtic ( are there any opinions about this ? ) . could the celtic model have influenced germanic languages so that we still today have rather similar reduplication in the colloquial registers ( just my own modest idea . . . ) ? here are some examples provided by netters : - - welsh : ty bach bach ' a very small house ' oglau cryf cryf ' a very strong smell ' - - gaelic : fada fada ' very long ' trua trua ' very pity ' - - breton : braz-braz ' very tall ' this is said to be common especially in negative sentences . * in colloquial russian reduplication / repetition of adj 's / adv 's has likewise an intensifying function . the use is probably stylistically similar to repetition in colloquial english , but it is said to be limited to * predicate * adjectives : belyj-belyj ' very white ' tixo-tixo ' very quietly ' * it was also pointed that finnish has prefixed reduplication in some intensified adjectival forms . this is true , indeed , but - - what it seems - - wholly lexicalized and non-productive . in any case , here are some examples i and my colleague enjoyed coming up with : taysi ' full ' ( umlaut a ) tapo-taysi ' completely full ' ( uml . a 's & o ) tyhja ' empty ' ( uml . a ) typo-tyhja ' compl . empty ' ( uml . a 's & o ) puhdas ' clean ' puti-puhdas ' compl . clean ' uusi ' new ' upo-uusi ' brand new ' pinta 's urface ' piri-pinta ' right on the surface ' suomalainen ' finnish ' supi-suomalainen ' purely finnish ' yksin ' alone ' ypo-yksin ' compl . alone ' ( uml . o ) tiessaan ' lost ' ( uml . a 's ) tipo-tiessaan ' compl . lost ' ( uml . a 's & o ) the prefixed items ' tapo ' , ' typo ' , ' tipo ' , 's upi ' , ' puti ' , ' piri ' , ' upo ' , ' ypo ' do not seem to mean anything , at least for the speakers today . it seems that the first vowel or the pair first consonant & vowel of the stem are reduplicated with a binding syllable that most often has a ' p ' and a vowel , e . g . : ta-po - taysi , ty-po - tyhja , u-po - uusi , y-po - yksin could this have been productive in some earlier stage of the language ? * finally , in classical ( only ? ) greek a small number of * verbs * may have reduplication to communicate some sort of intensifying , expressive or affective notions : pam-phain - ei ' it shines brightly ' ( ( * phan-phan - j-ei ) 3 . continuation or completion reduplication is , evidently , often used in the formation of present , progressive or perfective . i take here the view that present or progressive forms combine with * continuation * , whereas perfective forms communicate * completion * . it was nice to discover that "" classical "" linguistic tradition can offer fitting data here . it feels appropriate to begin with these examples . - - - * in sanskrit , the perfect stem is formed by reduplication : budh - ' know ' bubodh - perf . jan - ' born ' jajan - perf . aorist ( ' true perfect ' ) roots may also be formed by a kind of reduplication : jan - ajijana - ( aor . ) in addition , present stems may be formed by reduplication : bhii - 'd rink ' bibhii - pres . * classical greek uses partial reduplication , i . e . prefixation of the initial consonant of a verb plus the vowel ' e ' , in stems for perfect tenses : le-lu - k-a ' i have freed ' pe-poie : - k-a ' i have made ' ge-grap - tai ' it has been written ' if the root begins with a vowel , the vowel is augmented . furthermore , some common verbs take reduplication in their * present * tense ; the initial consonant is reduplicated with the vowel ' i ' : di-do : - mi ' i give / am giving ' gi-gno - mai ' i am becoming ' ti-the : - mi ' i am placing ' ( ( * thi-the : - mi ) * in latin , perfect forms may involve reduplication : curro ' run ' cucurri perf . - - - let us then go over to more living languages . * in hausa , reduplication applied to verbs in two different ways expresses completion or continuity respectively . modified suffixed reduplication gives an idea of * completed * action : cika ' fill ' cikakke compl . jefa ' throw ' jefaffe compl . prefixed reduplication communicates "" something like continuity "" , as expressed by the respondent : buga ' beat ' bubbuga ' keep on beating ' kira ' call ' kikkira ' call various people ' * in tagalog ( philippines ) , reduplication distinguishes * imperfective * actions from perfective : bili root of ' buy ' bibili irrealis imperfective upo root of 's it ' uupo irr . imp . kuha root of ' get ' kukuha irr . imp . some scholars call irrealis perfective * completed * aspect and irrealis imperfective * contemplated * aspect . this makes sense , since irrealis imperfective ' bibili ' seems to translate to ' will buy ' . * in wailevu / fijian ( austronesia ) , reduplication is used in so called "" object defocusing "" that involves repetition of the action and a progressive marker : au xau-ta na agone ' i carry the child ' au xau-xau jixo ' i ' m carrying now ' au dola-va na xaatuba ' i open the window ' au dola-dola jixo ' i ' m opening now ' moreover , in this language adjectives may be derived from verbs through reduplication . even if noted to be "" not productive "" , the process is fascinating : sava-ta ' wash - tr ' sava-sava - a ' clean ' the adjective could be understood to represent * completed * action , the result , in a way very similar to how the perfect participle works in , say , germanic : she has washed the cloth . - - ) a washed cloth * in nahuatl ( "" aztec "" ) , reduplication may affect the meaning of a verb in several ways . - - an action carried out in a "" systematic "" ( progressive ? ) way : tequi base for ' to slice ' or ' to hack ' te : tequi 's lice / carve something ' cho : ca ' weep ' cho : cho : ca ' weep continuously ' - - of the same base verbs , an action carried out in a "" random "" ( involving repetition ? ) way : tehtequi ' hack something up ' chohcho : ca ' to sob ' - - furthermore , reduplication may be recursive ( e . g . of ' weep continuously ' & 's ob ' respectively ) : cho : cho : cho : ca chohchohcho : ca - - verbs with certain morphologic characteristic may take on reduplication to indicate * repeated action * : tzili : ni ' make a metallic sound ' tzttzilica ' jingle ' tzitzilitza ' make something jingle ' * in afrikaans , reduplication applied to some verbs seems give a progressive idea : hy loop eet-eet ' he eats continuously while walking ' 4 . diminution there are not many examples of * diminution * in the total of replies . in a sense , the process of "" making something smaller "" could possibly go under the more general strategy of * intensification or increase * ( although it is literally about "" decrease "" ) . nevertheless , there were a couple of possibly fitting cases : * cantonese may use reduplication to convey * diminution * or * moderation * . * it was pointed that english ( ! ) has some "" diminutive "" reduplication in formations like ' itsy-bitsy ' , ' eensie - weensie ' , ' teeny-tiny ' . these carry the content ' very small ' , but they belong merely to the child-speak register . in any case , the examples are diagnostic of the diminutive case . 5 . other there are uses of reduplication that go beyond the suggested four categories above . with some restraint , some of these could perhaps be seen as slight offsprings of the more general principle of marking * plurality * . i do not go into detailed examples but mention some most common semantic categories : - - distributive reduplication : presupposes two or more referents that are taken separately ( type : ' one by one ' ) - - reflexive notions go naturally hand in hand with distributive ( type : ' one another ' ) - - the so called * delimitative aspect * , i . e . 'd oing something for a while ' , in mandarin and cantonese does not at first seem to fit in * continuity * or * completion * . however , the semantics of the delimitative aspect is said to encompass "" implied repetition "" : tai-tai ' take a look at ' ( cant . ) chang-chang ' have a taste ' ( man . ) shi-shi ' have a go ' ( man . ) what would seem logical to me is that a casual , temporally short action like ' take a look ' reaches its termination quicker than standard ' looking ' . i do n't know if this kind of an implicit sense of "" rapid completion "" could be the motivation of this reduplication ? - - - then there are numerous instances of reduplication that communicate * contrastive emphasis * . these do not necessarily combine with the above functional categories at all . the motivation of such reduplication is merely to * make a point * clearer . the ( american ) english "" double "" is a seemingly nice example of this : shall we rent a car car , or would you rather have a jeep ? of course , emphasis is a sort of * intensification * and , thus , it touches the theme of our discussion . * * * * now i think it 's time to close this rather lengthy summary . thanks for reading it . if you would like to add something to the discussion - - like comment on my suggestions - - , feel free to e-mail ( or snailmail ) the "" stuff "" directly to me .

( i think ferc staff should be involved or it will get bogged down ) . parties should reconvene within 15 days after ferc ' s order adopting a model and the ferc order should direct the participants ( like us ) to submit a joint proposal within 45 days thereafter . she recommends to ferc that parties be allowed to file comments to ferc within 20 days ( however , she recommends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproductive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process . ) the commission will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations , may reject her recommendations , or change something . i would expect that the commission would adopt many of her recommendations , while allowing further mediated - type discussions on some issues ( hopefully , ferc will adopt many of our suggested changes ) . judge mccartney then basically describes both proposals of the grid group and the southern , etal . group , then provides the stakeholder participants ' comments ( almost verbatim from all submissions to her ) . while she states that the process should keep moving quickly , she does not adopt any timeframes ( we will comment that ferc should retain its dec 02 day 2 start date ( for lmp / financial rights congestion model to be implemented ) . the attachments below are her report , the southern , etal proposal and the grid pricing , congestion management , operating , and planning protocols ( without any changes ) . clearly , our response ferc will include our proposed changes to the documents . highlights from her report below : she recommends that spp pursue an rto coalition in the midwest she encourages ferc to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative process which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input , regardless of the rto platform ultimately adopted by ferc her opinion is that the "" grid ( entergy , gridsouth and gridflorida utility sponsored ) model "" ( transco in rto , lmp / financial rights congestion management ) is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements of order no . 2000 based on a "" best practices "" analysis of other rtos and commission precedent . this is good because enron generally favors the grid model . however , she does provide the commission information on southern , etal . ' s proposal ( independent system administrator - - like national grid - type ) in her report , even though she has concerns that the southern , etal model is not order no . 2000 compliant . the southern , etal . model has a hybrid physical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements and lmp in real time ( with penalties ) and significant control area responsibilities . the significant aspects of the grid model are discussed below : grid governance : rto is a for profit transco with an independent board and an enhancement : the independent market administrator ( ima ) . the ima was added to facilitate public power participation ( worried that transmission owner on top , even if divested from generation , would favor its transmission solutions over generation or other transmission solution ) . the ima would administer the markets ; exercise operational authority over the transmission system ; administer one oasis ( with one process for interconnection and transmission requests ) ; and assume the security coordinator function . she strongly encourages this split . good stakeholder advisory committee ( provides majority and minority views ) and an independent market monitor to monitor the rto and the markets allows for independent transmission companies ( entergy wants to be one ) , with rto oversight describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control areas for physical operation , such as switching transmission elements , pursuant to operating procedures approved by the rto / ima . recognizes that consolidation of control areas may occur as rto matures . ( protocols should be subject to further discussion ) rto / transco has primary responsibility for tariff administration , including rate changes and tariff filings all load under the rates , terms and conditions of oatt ( gridsouth group has appealed this part of earlier commission orders , and , thus , retains their rights should they win on appeal ) 4 transmission pricing zones initially : entergy , southern , gridsouth , and gridflorida . allows for participant funded , direct assigned , and merchant transmission . transmission rates to loads in rto will be zonal ( for existing facilities ) and regional charge ( for new facilities , other than those above ) . there will be one "" through and out rate "" , plus a grid management charge for rto operation . encourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to oatt financial rights / lmp ( includes "" real time spot market "" ) is clearly the preferred model and represents best practices model ( from pjm and spp ) - - many details need to be worked out in continued discussions . model allows parties to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges ( fch ) . stakeholder process needs to be continued for fch allocation , auction and non - discriminatory release . the grid model includes a "" balancing resource "" requirement that we will provide comments against will allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be supported - - control area operators required to provide before such market establishment rto runs single oasis and independently calculates atc and ttc rto / transco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder process numerous comments from marketers , ipps on reduction of control area functions ( all of our comments from last week ' s response are included ) judge mccartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners . ( 1 ) many are still concerned that ferc had not conducted a "" cost - benefit "" analysis and had concerns over the costs . she responds that extrapolation of costs to the entire se rto seems unwarranted because it ignores the "" economies of scale "" and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure . in any event , ferc could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process that would involve the state commissions . ( 2 ) concerned about cost shifting : mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the commission has allowed . ( 3 ) concern that se rto would preempt state ability to approve asset transfers to rto and want state retail customers to receive full value for assets . ( 4 ) concern that se rto may prematurely put southern states into retail open access ( concerns with cal . ) judge encourages the commission to utilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners . i think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant "" jump start "" it gave to the se rto process due to the significant role played by judge mccartney and her team on focusing the discussions . furthermore , the initial results after 45 days show the majority of participants favoring a "" best practices "" pjm / spp cornerstone type real time spot energy market with lmp pricing and financial congestion hedges and an rto with an independent board structure that accommodates a for - profit rto entity with a significant stakeholder advisory process . the commission should consider utilize the fundamentals resulting from this mediation for other regions , or , at a minimum , consider similar mediated "" jump starts .

"re : pricing credit on thousands of names we can continue the discussion in tuesday ' s conference call , but i discussed with ben about the issues below , and here are some thoughts . this is not a complete approach , but only a starting point for discussion . the main task is to build a pricing system for many names . this has two components - - - 1 ) how to price a single name ? 1 . 1 ) how to price a liquid single name ? 1 . 2 ) how to price an illiquid single name ? 2 ) how to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names ? the approach i would take for 1 . 1 is a ) define a small set of liquid names b ) apply each of the different models we have , say , the six models ben has mentioned below , to these names c ) include market prices , if any , for these names d ) sit with traders , get trader ' s intuition on where each liquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in ( b ) and ( c ) e ) try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models f ) quantify these attributes , if possible g ) try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process , and see if the decisions in the last round still make sense the approach for 1 . 2 may be a ) define a small set of illiquid names b ) apply each of the different models we have to these names c ) sit with traders , get trader ' s intuition on where each illiquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in ( b ) d ) try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models e ) check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names f ) define a master set of liquid names g ) look for relationships ( by analyzing cross - section of data ) between attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names and their attributes , then this mapping can be entered into a table , and the pricing can be automated for all names ( in theory ) ! the success will depend on the success of the round - table sessions for the approaches for 1 . 1 and 1 . 2 . building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task , but we can get going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any new models that we may build . new models can be added to the suite of existing models . i do not believe there will ever be a single model that will answer all questions for all names , but rather we can refine the mappings and relative choices among models over time , which would mean continuing round - table sessions with traders . limited data makes calibration very hard , so i would continually ask the question "" what do we calibrate ? "" throughout the discussions for 1 . 1 and 1 . 2 , and this may help guide us to new models . vasant benjamin parsons 06 / 19 / 2000 04 : 11 am to : ect london credit trading cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , amitava dhar / corp / enron @ enron , steven leppard / lon / ect @ ect , grant masson / hou / ect @ ect , dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , jitendra j patel / lon / ect @ ect , oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect subject : pricing credit on thousands of names all - our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] . most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information , making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective . currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under development : fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg ' s fair market ( par yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology . fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding differences . bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs , but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated using both spread and probability approaches . under testing . bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer , the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve , then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing . market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap prices . kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next . each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia , capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing system . our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific ' soft ' data from credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights . the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc . the key steps to implementing such a system will be : establishing what exactly we want to ' predict ' - is it a price , a rating , a probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to , which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping from rating / score to price . getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to calibrate the model . building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and software packages to use ? determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited information into the model . getting the "" true "" market price , in order to feed back an error . at present such a price exists for very few credits . allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would take 6 - 10 man - months to develop . further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don ' t yet have the knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be especially required on this if we are to continue to move at ' internet speed ' . regards ben",Safe Email

"sum : a ( formerly ) productive morphological process ? about 3 weeks ago , i posted in linguist 6-954 a query regarding the status in current english of a compounding process , involving the use of a ` combining form ' ending in - o - , which had given us not only such ethnic / geograhical terms as ` anglo - saxon ' , ` afro - asiatic ' , and ` dano - norwegian ' but ` sociopolitical ' , ` socioeconomic ' , etc . i was prompted in this query by the recent replacement of the label ` afro - american ' by the fuller form ` african american ' and by the appearance in a new edition of a college textbook of the term ` european american ' to mean what i have long referred to as ` euro - american ' . the issue first came to my attention a few years ago through a column in the university of illinois newspaper , in which an undergraduate woman of african ancestry explicitly rejected the label ` black ' on the grounds that it is , technically , inaccurate ; the skins of the people in question are merely a darker shade of brown than those of europeans . having said this , she then went on to reject the label ` afro - american ' because she could n't find ` afro ' on a map . as a linguist , i naturally wondered if she was unaware of the general compounding process involved . then a few weeks ago at work i found that the authors of the above-mentioned textbook ( on sociology , if i remember correctly ) had meticulously replaced every instance of the label ` white ' in the previous edition with the expression ` european - american ' . i began wondering if i was seeing a trend . first of all , i would like to thank the following respondents : lynne cahill < lynneca @ cogs . susx . ac . uk > lee hartman < ga5123 @ siucvmb . siu . edu > larry horn < lhorn @ yalevm . cis . yale . edu > james kirchner < jpkirchner @ aol . com > kevin lemoine < lemoine @ mail . utexas . edu > the general consensus seems to be that the ascendency of the full expression ` african - american ' can be dated to a speech by the rev . jesse jackson in the late 80 's . to quote lee hartman : ` i think the entire "" phenomenon "" can be attributed to a single individual , and with alittle research we could even determine the precise date when he made his announcement . this is a textbook case of "" pristine "" etymology ( where the historical events giving rise to a word are still alive in the memories of living witnesses ) . ` i ' m referring to an announcement made by jackson to the effect that he felt the term "" black "" had too many negative connotations , and that he wanted to institute a more dignified term for americans descended from africans . ` i think jackson said explicitly that he briefly considered the term "" afro - american "" , but he rejected it on the grounds that "" afro "" was too closely equated with a particular hair-style , and he did n't want a term that would suggest merely "" americans who wear afro hair-do 's "" . ' a second motivating consideration mentioned by some of my respondents was that the reduction of ` african ' to ` afro - ' involved in the formation of the older ` afro - american ' might be interpreted as deemphasis and might thus be irritating , if not offensive , to people who regard their african heritage as a matter of pride . this is quite plausible , although it is n't consistent throughout the general speech community : it is not the case that every english speaker , in every circumstance , regards the formation of the - o - combining form from some word for the purpose of coining a compound involves the deemphasis of that word or its referent . for instance , in regarding myself as a ` euro - american ' i definitely emphasize the ` euro - ' part . and another of my respondents pointed out progovac ' recent rejection of the label ` serbo - croatian ' in favour of ` serbian / croatian ' on the grounds that the older / more traditional / conven - tional label places too * much * emphasis on the serbian component . on a somewhat parallel note , one of my respondents suggested that the form ` euro - ' might be rejected because , at least to an american , its most obvious association is with the expression ` eurotrash ' , which i have to admit is not part of my experience ; i am more accustomed to its usage in europe , in which it tends to connote ` cosmopolitan ' or at least ` pan - european ' as opposed to narrowly nationalistic . on the broader question addressed by my query , there appears to be no evidence that the morphological process of creating combining forms in - o - is itself on the way out in english ; only one or two instantiations of it are currently being rejected by some people for sociopolitical reasons . as to the past history of this process in english ( it 's presumably either borrowed from or heavily encouraged by greek ) , i have so far heard very little . best , steven - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *",Safe Email

"turbine disposition exposure - - mhi f ' s and w 501 d 5 a to all , i ' m very concerned , as i ' m sure you are , about the exposure of holding the mitsubishi units and the westinghouse 501 d . with the market for machines getting softer , the opportunity to sell these units looks increasingly slim . mhi units : i recommend that we seriously evaluate developing a project or projects around the mhi units . to do this , a project may have to underperform financially , but it may be significantly less of a hit than holding the machines for an indefinite time . when this has been suggested , the resonse is that the economics don ' t work for this project . the value of the units is around $ 160 mm and the cost of holding them will only increase . to avoid a major impact i feel it ' s important that we consider this issue on a global enron basis , rather than on a project basis . one potential opportunity would be to put these some of these units into the mid - west project which fred mitro has gotten permitted . other potential projects may also be good vehicles . w 501 d 5 a : we need to reach closure on this unit . as a single unit , this unit may be easier to dispose of . if we can get it out of the legal arena , perhaps we can get siemens - westinghouse to take it back for what we paid . otherwise , we should go ahead and get it equipped with a generator and either sell it or put it into a project . as it stands now , the cost of holding it will be going up monthly . ron tapscott is now the lead for addressing this issue . if the group thinks that the above suggestions have any merit , perhaps we should discuss what has to happen internally to pursue either of these to execution . thanks ! mike",Safe Email

I'm sure this is common knowledge already, but just in case ...http://security.tombom.co.uk/shatter.html   This paper presents a new generation of attacks against Microsoft
   Windows, and possibly other message-based windowing systems. The
   flaws presented in this paper are, at the time of writing,
   unfixable. The only reliable solution to these attacks requires
   functionality that is not present in Windows, as well as efforts on
   the part of every single Windows software vendor. Microsoft has
   known about these flaws for some time; when I alerted them to this
   attack, their response was that they do not class it as a flaw -
   the email can be found here. This research was sparked by comments
   made by Microsoft VP Jim Allchin who stated, under oath, that there
   were flaws in Windows so great that they would threaten national
   security if the Windows source code were to be disclosed. He
   mentioned Message Queueing, and immediately regretted it. However,
   given the quantity of research currently taking place around the
   world after Mr Allchin's comments, it is about time the white hat
   community saw what is actually possible.

additional complications for some of the other architectures.
(Essentially, they make most of the other architectures' ISO images
available gratis, because they aren't selling boxed sets and want the
public to have them anyway.  The ISOs include third-party proprietary
apps, but of necessity not the highly-restricted ones available in 
boxed set editions.)(1) You can get a single-disk ISO9660 image of SuSE ""evaluation""
edition, version 7.0, _lots_ of places, including here:ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/evaluation-7.0/evaluation-7.0.iso(2) You could ""wget -r"" (or equivalent) the entire 8.0 FTP Edition (for
lack of an official name for it) from here (or mirror sites):ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/8.0/Please note the restricted rights granted for use of the SuSE-originated
YaST program specifically, stated here:ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/8.0/COPYRIGHT.yastA grant of limited redistribution rights to the distribution as a whole 
(apparently covering the FTP Edition and the Evaluation Edition) is
stated here: ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/README.mirror-policy   Quoting:     please make sure that you meet the following conditions if
     you intend to mirror ftp.suse.com:   - SuSE Linux (YaST in particular) may not be reproduced on
     CDs or other media FOR VALUE. Reproduction for personal
     or educational use is explicitly allowed and encouraged.> I'm not sure on the details of it, but I think SuSE have
> probably done an OpenBSD of the cd they sell?OpenBSD Foundation assert a compilation copyright over the OpenBSD
official ISO9660 image.  A compilation copyright is the copyright
monopoly that, for example, the editor of a set of third-party short
stories receives.  Even though he didn't write any of the constituent
stories, he put creative work into selecting, arranging, and editing
those stories.  The law recognises such efforts as creative works
deserving copyright protection, if there is sufficient creative effort.
(A judge would decide, if someone made a court case of it.)  Courts have
held, on the other hand, that arrangement and publication of
alphabetical telephone listings in a ""yellow pages"" telephone directory
(the advertising section) don't have anywhere near enough creative
content to support an overreaching telco's claim of compilation
copyright.  (The court politely said ""Nice try"", in effect.)The OpenBSD Foundation's claim may be a bit of a legal bluff, too.
Theoretically, one could get around it by creating a slightly different
set of ISO9660 images, thereby finessing the claim of compilation
copyright.  But nobody bothers, because OpenBSD Foundation actually 
charges only a very reasonable price for jewel-case sets, and nobody
wants to endure the barrage of hatemail from Theo & co.I've never seen any claim from SuSE of compilation copyright on its ISOs
or distribution as a whole.> I could be wrong, I don't use SuSE so haven't investigated,
> but essentially the only 'free' version of SuSE will be it's
> ftp offering.Again, the ""FTP Edition"" and the Evaluation Edition may be redistributed
more-or-less freely, as long as it's not ""for value"".  (Ditto the
""live-eval"" edition, which is a demo only.)  The three boxed sets'
contents may not.--

- but how can we perceive those regularities ? - and how do we reason on the basis of that knowledge if there are no observable constraints on infererring ? - but if there are , where do they come from and how are they actually implemented mentally ? - and finally : how do we come to act rationally , that is , in accordance with what we have perceived , processed and inferred . we are interested in all ways of defining rules and in all aspects of rule following , from the definition of law , rule , regularity , similarity and analogy to logical consequence , argumentational and other inferences , statistical and linguistic rules , practical and strategic reasoning , pragmatic and praxeological activities . we expect contribution from the following research fields : game-theory , action theory , argumentation theory , cognitive science , linguistics , philosophy of language , epistemology , pragmatics , psychology and semiotics . we would be happy to include some contributions from natural sciences such as neuro-biology , physiology or brain sciences . the conference is organized in three major sections : philosophy , psychology and linguistics with six keynote lectures . then contributions of 30 minutes ( 20 for paper and 10 for discussion ) will follow . we also plan to organize a workshop at the end of each section abstracts : abstracts should be one-page ( maximum 23 lines ) specifying area of contribution and the particular aspect of rule-following to be addressed . abstracts should be sent by e-mail to : tarnay @ btk . jpte . hu or bocz @ btk . jpte . hu . hard copies of abstracts may be sent to : laszlo tarnay department of philosophy janus pannonius university , ifjusag utja 6 , h-7624 pecs , hungary important dates : deadline for submission : march 15 , 1998 notification of acceptance : march 25 , 1998 conference : april 30 - may 1 - 2 , 1998 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * for those concerned there is a follow-up philosophical colloquium : john mcdowell : mind and world - kant in analytic philosophy which discusses mcdowell 's recent book : mind and world . among would-be participants are barry allen , michael williams and robert brandon . if interested , contact prof . janos boros , dept . of philosophy , janus pannonius university . e-mail : boros @ btk . jpte . hu",Safe Email

You aren't the first person to ask this question, but over the last few
years there have been some good answers to this coming from the genetics
research folks.  As I understand it, there is a growing body of genetic
evidence that European immune systems are substantially tougher and more
resistant to a wider range of infectious diseases than those found in other
peoples around the world, including a surprisingly wide range of hereditary
immunities and partial immunities/resistance to common viruses and bacteria
found around the world.  As a result, when the first wholesale mixing of
people from different parts of the world started occurring on a regular
basis, the Europeans fared much better than most others.The standard theory for this is that Europe was the first major region of
the planet to become densely populated and urbanized (to the extent that
they ""urbanized"" a thousand years ago).  Because of this, Europe was a
festering cauldron of disease without the benefit of modern sanitation and
medicine for a thousand plus years, much more so than the rest of the world
and suffered from repeated large-scale epidemics and plagues that took
severe tolls on the population.  Modern ethnic Europeans have genetics that
survived a unique and brutal culling process by a rather extensive range of
diseases over dozens of generations.What the geneticists are discovering is that for a great many of the world's
most common infectious diseases, there is a percentage of the ethnically
European population that has hereditary immunity and an even larger segment
that has at least some hereditary resistance compared to people from other
parts of the world.  And for most ethnic Europeans it isn't just one
disease, they have varying levels of genetic resistance to a veritable
cornucopia of infectious diseases.  Because of similarities in the
mechanisms and characteristics of viruses and other pathogens around the
world to ones that Europeans were exposed to, the robust defenses their
genetics provided them against their native diseases frequently imparted
some resistance to diseases which they had never been exposed.Cheers,-James Rogers

ZDNet AnchorDesk NewsletterTHURSDAY, JULY 18, 2002
Why we're changing our publishing schedule
Dear Reader,As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every FridayWhy are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.  Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works. I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.Sincerely,
David Coursey
Executive Editor

Module:         nfs
Announced:      2002-08-05
Credits:        Mike Junk 
Affects:        All releases prior to 4.6.1-RELEASE-p7

FreeBSD only:   NOI.   BackgroundThe Network File System (NFS) allows a host to export some or all of
its filesystems, or parts of them, so that other hosts can access them
over the network and mount them as if they were on local disks.  NFS is
built on top of the Sun Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework.II.  Problem DescriptionA part of the NFS server code charged with handling incoming RPC
messages had an error which, when the server received a message with a
zero-length payload, would cause it to reference the payload from the
previous message, creating a loop in the message chain.  This would
later cause an infinite loop in a different part of the NFS server
code which tried to traverse the chain.III. ImpactCertain Linux implementations of NFS produce zero-length RPC messages
in some cases.  A FreeBSD system running an NFS server may lock up
when such clients connect.An attacker in a position to send RPC messages to an affected FreeBSD
system can construct a sequence of malicious RPC messages that cause
the target system to lock up.IV.  Workaround1) Disable the NFS server: set the nfs_server_enable variable to ""NO""
   in /etc/rc.conf, and reboot.   Alternatively, if there are no active NFS clients (as listed by the
   showmount(8) utility), just killing the mountd and nfsd processes
   should suffice.2) Add firewall rules to block RPC traffic to the NFS server from
   untrusted hosts.V.   SolutionThe following patch has been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.4, 4.5, and
4.6 systems.a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:36/nfs.patch
# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:36/nfs.patch.ascb) Apply the patch.# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patchc) Recompile your kernel and modules as described in
 and reboot the
system.VI.  Correction detailsThe following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.Path                                                             Revision

Are applied crypto people suffering higher rates of unemployment than general application programmers? (From my statistically too small sample of acquaintances it might appear so.)If this is so, why is it?- you might think the physical security push following the world political instability worries following Sep 11th would be accompanied by a corresponding information security push -- jittery companies improving their disaster recovery and to a lesser extent info sec plans.- governments are still harping on the info-war hype, national information infrastructure protection, and the US Information Security Czar Clarke making grandiose pronouncements about how industry ought to do various things (that the USG spent the last 10 years doing it's best to frustrate industry from doing with it's dumb export laws)- even Microsoft has decided to make a play of cleaning up it's security act (you'd wonder if this was in fact a cover for Palladium which I think is likely a big play for them in terms of future control points and (anti-)competitive strategy -- as well as obviously a play for the home entertainment system space with DRM)However these reasons are perhaps more than cancelled by:- dot-com bubble (though I saw some news reports earlier that though there is lots of churn in programmers in general, that long term unemployment rates were not that elevated in general)- perhaps security infrastructure and software upgrades are the first things to be canned when cash runs short? - software security related contract employees laid off ahead of full-timers? Certainly contracting seems to be flat in general, and especially in crypto software contracts look few and far between. At least in the UK some security people are employed in that way (not familiar with north america).- PKI seems to have fizzled compared to earlier exaggerated expectations, presumably lots of applied crypto jobs went at PKI companies downsizing. (If you ask me over use of ASN.1 and adoption of broken over complex and ill-defined ITU standards X.500, X.509 delayed deployment schedules by order of magnitude over what was strictly necessary and contributed to interoperability problems and I think significantly to the flop of PKI -- if it's that hard because of the broken tech, people will just do something else.)- custom crypto and security related software development is perhaps weighted towards dot-coms that just crashed.- big one probably: lack of measurability of security -- developers with no to limited crypto know-how are probably doing (and bodging) most of the crypto development that gets done in general, certainly contributing to the crappy state of crypto in software. So probably failure to realise this issue or perhaps just not caring, or lack of financial incentives to care on the part of software developers. Microsoft is really good at this one. The number of times they re-used RC4 keys in different protocols is amazing! Other explanations? Statistics? Sample-of-one stories?Adam -- yes, still employed in sofware security industry; and in addition have been doing crypto consulting since 97 (http://www.cypherspace.net/) if you have any interesting applied crypto projects; reference commissions paid.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",Safe Email

I can say I'll make any progress, but I may dabble.  Thanks again for
all your work in this area.  Generalized sequence support has been on
my to do list for about 8 years.--

"california update 1 / 22 / 01 executive summary discussions continue today over bill ablx , focus will be on price and term . new legislation introduced today whereby the state will try to save the utilities from bankruptcy by taking ownership of utilities ' hydro assets in exchange for rate increases . wednesday , state receives bids from auction , rate ranges are expected to be between 5 . 5 and 8 . 0 cents per kilowatt hour . mid week , audit findings will be released ; audit expected to show pg & e ' s utility subsidiary handed over $ 5 b to the holding company . the holding company used $ 4 . 4 b to pay shareholder dividends and buyback stock . state commissioned study to see who would benefit more in a possible bankruptcy scenario . bankruptcy still very possible for both companies . davis concerned about possible ballot issues and how those may effect futue solutions or "" bail out "" . legislation there will be continued discussion regarding bill ablx in the senate today . the discussion will focus on the rate cap of 5 . 5 cents per kilowatt hour as well as the term . assemblyman keeley , the author , indicated that he believed 5 . 5 cents was "" a fantasy "" and impossible to obtain . today , assembly speaker bob hertzberg , d - sherman oaks and assemblyman fred keeley , d - boulder creek will introduce legislation whereby the state would temporary or permanently take both pg & e and edision ' s hydroelectric facilities or transmission lines ( or both ) in exchange for keeping the utilities out of bankruptcy . the state would allow pg & e and edison to impose rate increases , however , the rates would not rise beyond the hikes approved earlier this month by the cpuc as an emergency surcharge . the money collected from consumers would go toward paying off their current debt and the state would then enter into long - term contracts with power generators . under the bill , the state of california would control 10 % of all california ' s electricity . as you can imagine , this legislation has not received unanimous praise . according to recent corporate filings , pg & e ' s hydroelectric plants alone would be valued between $ 3 and $ 5 billion . this amount just happens to be what davis estimates to be the final amount of money the state will have to guarantee once the audit of the utility companies is released and the political pressure is escalated on the parent companies to absorb some of the $ 12 billion in debt . davis is telling people that he thinks the audit will show the state should help with about $ 4 billion in debt , while the utilities , of course , say the full $ 12 billion should be covered . on wednesday , state officials will see the results of sealed bids from energy suppliers for long term contracts and see how close to reality their effort to keep utility rates unchanged for consumers will come . davis insists there are already several bids for his 5 . 5 cents per kilowatt hour ceiling , though few agree with his opinion . a handful of smaller , independent electricity providers with about a 30 % share of california power market , indicated sunday night they would come down to "" less than eight cents "" or less than half of what they currently charge , in return for the stability of long term contracts . because consumers pay about 6 . 5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity under current puc rules , any hope california has to "" work off "" the back debts for these utilities lies in hitting something very close to davis ' price cap , without falling back on higher prices for consumers . the level of bids will be particularly important since bond rating agencies moved to put the state of california on a credit watch on friday , worried that there was no obvious long - term repayment plan for the billions of dollars they are on the hook for spending to keep the lights on in the state . utility ' s audit by the middle of this week , california auditors will release their findings about how much money pg & e and socal edison actually owe to institutions outside their own holding company structure . this will define the limits of what the state will guarantee , if they guarantee any of the debt . the truly explosive part of the audit may be its findings that the two companies used billions of dollars from consumers to buy back their own stock in recent years . a source with knowledge of the audits said the audit is expected to show that in the last three years , pg & e ' s utility subsidiary handed over about $ 5 billion to the holding company . of that total , the holding company used $ 4 . 4 billion to pay shareholder dividends and buyback shares of its stock . another finding from the audit shows that state helped caused the current power crisis when regulators , at the time of deregulation ( under the direction of former r - gov . pete wilson ) , forced the two utilities to sell at least half of their power - generating plants . auditors are expected to say that if the utilities still owned all these plants , electricity would cost only 7 cents a kilowatt hour , compared with over 30 cents an hour on average in december and january . bankruptcy the threat of bankruptcy is still very real for both utilities . senior advisors said that these utilities were on the path often followed by utility companies that ended in bankruptcy . as all the parties involved hunker down for another intensely political week , they all remain determined to avoid bankruptcy , but to push this as close to the brink as possible in the hopes of squeezing out an advantage . under such conditions , the risks of one or more of the players fumbling and triggering the great unknowable outcome of bankruptcy , is still quite high . california ' s political leaders order a series of independent analyses to determine who would suffer most in a case of bankruptcy , the state or the two utilities . the short answer was that no one has any idea . below are the findings of the report and some of the possible scenarios that would face a bankruptcy judge : 1 ) would the companies be eligible for chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy ? some of the advisors thought that pg & e and edison ' s finances were so bad that chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy may not even be an option . advisors said that a bankruptcy judge might take a good look at the corporate debt load and decide that reorganization would do no good and order the companies into full liquidation . this would most certainly be guaranteed chaos . 2 ) could the bankruptcy court actually force the puc to raise the price of electricity to consumers ? the legal basis for passing on rate increases to consumers is a lot less solid than originally thought , particularly if there is widespread public outrage directed at the electricity companies . and there is still the question of the unilateral power of a bankruptcy judge . 3 ) if the bankruptcy judge takes his job of protecting corporate assets seriously and finds that pg & e and edison cannot afford to buy electricity , he could order them to stop buying it and thus lead to massive power outages . 4 ) if the utilities go into bankruptcy , the first creditors in line would be the lenders and bondholders with collateral pledges . the state could become almost the last creditor in line as it is just another electricity supplier ( one of the reasons why suppliers won ' t sell electricity on credit to these companies now ) . 5 ) if the two companies went bankrupt , it would be the largest bankruptcies in history , straining just about everyone involved in the process . 6 ) the corporate approval allowing the parent company to segregate assets from the utility by the ferc for pg & e and already in place for edison may be far less effective than the utilities or the ratings agencies currently think . this is particularly true if this week ' s audit shows the two corporations transferring billions of dollars in the last few years into stock buybacks and shareholder dividend payments . davis opinion polls show that governor gray davis is getting high marks for his job , and the utilities are increasingly viewed as the culprits . one of davis concern ' s is , according to a senior official in the governor ' s office , that a deal is carved out that triggers a popular ballot initiative which is so anti - utility and anti - business that it cripples future growth in the state . according to a senior official , "" no one thought howard jarvis and his property tax initiative would succeed in destroying our education system , but he did , with one just ballot line and a lot of popular revulsion . the threat of direct , popular action is at least as large now as then . "" consumer advocate harvey rosenfield is already threatening to draw up a ballot initiative at the first sign that individual electricity consumers are being asked to help the utility companies repay their debt through higher rate - payer bills . this official goes on to say , "" the anger at utility companies is so high here , that almost anything rosenfield could think of would pass and we couldn ' t do anything about it . "" this threat has begun to complicate the one escape route on the debt front that had always appeared wide open to political leaders - - floating a bond issue or a guarantee for the money owed to institutions outside the corporate holding structure , and then letting the companies work that off with profits over the next several years .",Safe Email

the uncontrollable forest fires were the result of the Forest Service's
long-standing ""10:00 A.M. policy"", in place until the decision in 1963 to
switch over to ""let-it-burn"".The 10:00 A.M. policy was based on theories about forest management from
Europe, and wasn't as applicable to the American wilds. So, we went from a
policy of containment for 100 years to one of letting things burn unless they
directly threatened property.40 years after the end of the containment policy there is still a lot of stuff
left to burn. I can't imagine that artificially planted replacement
forests, with dense stands of identical trees, help that much either. I would be comfortable laying the fault for these contributing factors
squarely with the Forest Service. I would put the blame for many burned homes
upon the people who chose to build their dwelling with an unwise combination of
materials, location, and landscaping.--

"new book : van de vijver : the iambic issue . ruben van de vijver , the iambic issue . iambs as a result of constraint interaction in iambic languages stress on both the first and on the last syllable is avoided ; iambs are not assigned from right to left ; the prototypical iambic foot does not play a role in prosodic morphology . building on optimality theory , van de vijver argues that iambic feet are the result of constraint interaction rather than being building blocks of metrical theory . van de vijver presents detailed analyses of the stress patterns of several carib and yupik languages and shows that the rightheaded feet found on the surface in these languages are the result of the interaction between a constraint which favors leftheaded feet and a constraint which bars both the initial and the final syllable from being stressed . he argues further that iambs can only arise at the left edge of the word and analyzes the stress patterns of several lan - guages which are claimed to have iambs arising at the right edge of the word . one of the conclusions is that the prototypical iamb is never used as a building block in prosodic morphology . contents : 1 . introduction 2 . stress in cariban languages 3 . yupik prosody 4 . only the trochee : stress from right to left 5 . feet in prosodic morphology 6 . summary and conclusions 1998 . 271pp . isbn 90-5569 - 040 - 6 . paperback .

"comparative method these are notes after the recent discussions of karl teeter , amramer , sally thomason , after the aaa meetings sessions on distant language reconstructions , and also in response to part of mr . poser 's message of 14 december . first , most of the discussion of karl teeter i can agree with wholeheartedly except in the use of any of his criteria as absolutes . even grammatical things can be borrowed ( as sally pointed out ) . people do in practice * * * correctly * * * accept a language family such as uto - aztecan as essentially proven , even when no grammar has been written for the proto-language , or when only parts of a grammar are written . on the one hand , nobody would be disturbed much if it turned out that one of the assumed uto - aztecan languages was originally from another family , with truly massive borrowing from uto - aztecan . the overall hypothesis of a uto - aztecan family would not be shaken . on the other hand , asking the question how much of the grammar of the proto-language has to be written reveals the non-absoluteness of the criterion . only a tiny bit ? that might be subject to one of the special cases in which some morphology and other grammar were borrowed ( sally 's general type of example ) . so , again , karl is right in general , but wrong if any single criterion is taken as an absolute ( unless circularly many criteria are combined by feats of legalese into a single criterion ) . i would like to modify amramer 's statement in exactly the same spirit : ) we cannot demand a detailed morphological reconstruction ) until the languages are accepted as related . this is too strong . it is not quite the same as ramer 's ) but surely he does not mean that a comparative grammar is a ) prerequisite to a reconstruction ; it is part of a reconstruction . in practice , an extensive comparative grammar is indeed written as part of a reconstruction ( ramer 's second wording above , not his first above ) , but it is not likely to be written unless * * * both * * * of the following two conditions are fulfilled : 1 ) the languages are in fact related ( makes the grammar easier to write ) 2 ) enough scholars believe that the languages might be related and so put effort into establishing their links . it is some unwarranted discouragement of the second which needs to be dealt with in our field . ramer is right that some linguists do discourage attempts to prove what has not already been proven . no risk-taking , in other words . good researchers , attempting to write a grammar of altaic for example , will report all of their results , both for genetic relatedness , for borrowing , and for a host of other questions they will not even have thought of when they started their research . some researchers evaluate only the hypothesis they started with . very often the differences of viewpoint amount to nothing more than an elevation of what one does oneself into the "" true "" or "" real "" work of the field , instead of recognizing that it takes a number of different contributions . i will illustrate from karl teeter 's recent messages , with no malice intended , because i am absolutely sure he intends none himself . in modifying his wording to take account of amramer 's point that of course people do properly classify languages on the basis of phonological correspondences , teeter writes on 10 december : "" since it is clear that everybody 's first approximation to linguistic history begins with such classification . what i say is just that you cannot reconstruct languages on this basis . "" ( please note the words "" first approximation "" in this . that you cannot reconstruct languages on the bases of classification alone seems to me a tautology . ) later in the same message , teeter reverts to the more absolute statement : "" on the contrary , my contention ( not my invention ) , is that the only way to establish that languages are related is to write a grammar of the proto - langauge and show how it developed into different later grammars . "" ( please note the words "" the only way "" and "" establish "" . using these words does not change the fact that uto - aztecan is * * * correctly * * * accepted as a proven family without teeter 's criteria being satisfied . ) on 8 december , teeter wrote : ) "" systematic correspondences of sounds in the vocabularies "" may prove ) a connection between languages , which is certainly an interesting ) first step , but there the real work of comparative grammar starts : [ then teeter mentions four possible explanations , only one genetic ] ) until one can exclude the first three factors , one has proven ) nothing at all regarding genetic relationship . teeter discounts the enormous work of discovering likely language families in the first place , trivializes that as not the "" real work "" and establishment of systematic sound correspondences as proving "" nothing at all "" regarding genetic relationship . on the contrary , that does prove a grouping as a legitimate candidate for genetic relationship , and often the nature of the sound correspondences found will also have made one or more of the alternatives less probable . the work of comparative-historical grammarians is "" real work "" . so is the work of those who spend enormous hard-working hours sifting potential cognates to discover potential sound correspondences . do teeter and others really have no knowledge of how much work that takes ? at no stage is something ever completely proven in an absolute sense ( not even after a comparative grammar is written , because of the potential for undiscovered problems of the kind noted by sally thomas ) . all stages of the process contribute to the end result . all stages are equally "" the real work "" . proof is always incremental , not nothing , not complete and absolute . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i turn next to mr . poser 's message , and to other information gleaned at the aaa meetings . perhaps mr . poser will be surprised that i am enthusiastically in favor of anyone correcting any errors in any claims of language relationship or language structure , including mr . poser 's mention of kimball correcting errors in muskogean , even or especially if that means that a greenberg claim about pronouns in amerind is weakened . it is actually claims about morphology where i expect greenberg is least likely to have succeeded in contributing something . i thank mr . poser for the bibliography i can check against my lists of corrections and for this note on muskogean pronouns . i also agree with mr . poser that the criticism of errors in data does not rely on the mere authority of the critic . ( that was not my point about appeals to authority , so one of mr . poser 's paragraphs was not directly relevant . my earlier point about appeals to authority remains . ) i did not indicate ( as mr . poser 's message suggests ) that critics complained of errors when they could not back them up . what i did say was that they claimed greenberg 's errors made the method worthless , without bothering to test whether correction of the errors would actually lead to a change in his conclusions , and without promptly providing the data so others could carry out such a test . ) from conversations , i would judge some are still reluctant to face this test , the one required by a part of their claims . ( even if their claims on this point prove wrong in some degree , because the conclusions of greenberg 's method mostly remain the same even after errors of those kinds are corrected , it still will not follow that greenberg 's methods produce valid results on a regular basis . please notice how careful it is important to be with notions of proof for or against anything . ) in conversation with bob rankin at the recent aaa meetings i indicated i was glad greenberg had made the attempt at morphology , with his 3rd - person alternation between / y / and / t / as a putative relic irregularity , but i was equally likely to end up believing that he had discovered a new typological fact , a preference for these unmarked segments and recurring conditions under which they might alternate in more or less the same way , which might indicate that the same phenomenon could arise by chance repeatedly . we are always dealing simultaneously with possibilities of genetic relationship or convergent evolution . as a general warning about the danger of throwing out hypotheses too early because they are "" obviously "" cases of chance lookalikes or convergent evolution , an article "" common pathways of illumination "" by stephen jay gould of harvard , in natural history magazine , december 1994 pp . 10-20 , discusses the origins of eyes in different phyla of the animal kingdom . he states that this had been a classic case in biology , used to show convergent evolution of originally unrelated organs to serve the same function . however , the dna specialists have gotten their hands on this one , and apparently it is * * * the same dna * * * which is regulating important parts of the production of eyes in these various phyla , barring of course a few changes in a few amino acid codes . this dna is therefore genetically inherited ( and we are talking as far back as the common node on the family tree of drosophila fruit flies , squids , and humans ! ) . if this line of argument holds up , we have quite a revolution in thinking on our hands . ( such thinking can of course go far overboard too . ) "" chance lookalikes "" certainly do exist massively . sound symbolism is a typological basis for their recurrence . the too-easy use of "" chance lookalikes "" to reject comparisons can however also be just like the too-easy use of "" substrate "" and many other ways of purporting to explain phenomena , but in reality merely naming them without doing the hard work of really explaining them . as another factual contribution to the discussion of greenberg 's errors , bob rankin clarified for me at the aaa meetings that he had looked at greenberg 's original notebooks , and that apparently what happened is that greenberg had a single flexible flap in his notebook bearing the language names , and sheets which he matched up against that to enter data for particular lexical items . this is a mechanism subject to errors of the two pieces of paper slipping vertically relative to each other , and in fact there were rather a large number of such errors . it was errors of rows rather than of columns ( as i loosely had assumed without ever bothering to ask if rows or columns ) . mr . poser originally asked on 9th november whether "" limitations [ of the comparative method ] had been and were being used to justify resistance to proposals of emote relationships . . . "" please take careful note of this wording , as mr . poser changed the wording in his message of 14 december , when he asserts no example has been given . i gave mr . poser an eyewitness account satisfying the wording he used . i stand by that eyewitness account . ( i do not like naming names ever in these matters , but mr . poser 's assertion could be answered only by an eyewitness account . ) none of mr . poser 's supposed rebuttal in his recent message is at all relevant to that claim , though it is relevant to another claim , an absurd one , that i did not make . ( as in his previous message , mr . poser mixes several different wordings of what are quite radically different hypotheses . any extended discussion of these variants would not be relevant to any of our central points , so i omit them . ) to be specific about that absurd claim i did * not * make , i quite agree with mr . poser that some of the same people also criticize greenberg 's hypotheses based on the factual data . i have never denied that , and in fact took pains to refer to other good work by the same people , and have always emphasized the importance of having corrections of data . mr . poser 's conclusion was : ) it thus appears , as i thought , that there are no real examples of perceived ) limitations of the comparative method being used as the basis for rejecting ) proposals of genetic affiliation . since i gave an eyewitness account of such an example of the perceived limitations being used as one basis for rejecting proposals of genetic affiliation , mr . poser can only maintain his original assertion by converting it into a different assertion as he has here , namely that there is no case of a person using those perceived limitations as "" the "" ( read "" the only "" ) basis for rejecting such proposals . i will simply repeat that in the case to which i was eyewitness , the tone of the presentation was quite clear that the absurdity of the time depth was sufficient * * * in and of itself * * * to rule out the legitimacy of attempting such distant comparison . ( a critique of errors in greenberg 's data is not directly relevant to this point , even if engaged in by the same person . ) apparently mr . poser wants his allies to be persons who not only do good work , but also do nothing wrong . but we cannot posit such a division between the "" holy "" and the "" unclean "" , like the caste distinctions of traditional india . no one has the right to take such a position vis a vis other good-faith researchers , however much they may disagree with data , results , or methods . i gather from some conversations at the aaa that some of the people involved have become more moderate since the earlier years in these matters , at least in their public statements . that is certainly all to the good . there are also small beginnings of developments of method which may turn out to be relevant to our current limitations . i am perplexed by mr . poser 's discussion of the supposed rule of using only three-consonant matches never merely two-consonant matches . although i used siouxan - yuchi , because some amerindianists are considering this , the point does not depend in the slightest on whether one believes these two particular nodes are related or not . perhaps someone can propose another alternative ( i would suggest looking for one in tibeto - burman , where perhaps only one consonant , one vowel , and tone would be available , and yet the genetic relations are in some cases secure . ) i agree with mr . poser that it is better to have three consonants than two , and precisely because it helps to avoid chance resemblances . as i stated in the previous message . that means that the only difference between us is that mr . poser will consider treating the preferred method ( 3 consonants ) as the only permitted one : ) if ( probably contrary to fact ) , matches of three consonants are ) necessary to exclude chance , . . . i do not see why we should be ) unwilling , in that case , to conclude either that they are not ) related or that , if they are , the relationship is not demonstrable . the problem here is the notion that such a particular rule * could even conceivably * be "" necessary to exclude chance "" . no rule is necessary to exclude chance . a large number of procedures and methods can * * * help * * * to exclude chance . except in the most difficult cases of all , probably most single rules can be violated , and there will still be enough other ways of excluding chance that a good result can be achieved . it is this fossilization in the response to expansions of the methods available as part of "" the comparative method "" which is damaging to increasing the rigor as well as the power of our field . it is encouraging to see sessions on distant language relationships . i firmly believe some of these sessions would not be occurring nor would there be so much work on studying methods , if greenberg had not published that book . some of the growth of interdisciplinary cooperation and communication was also in the process of happening anyway , and greenberg just accidentally published at this time . ( i am not trying to credit him with causing all of this interest . ) i particularly liked john colarusso 's contribution to the eurasian session , because he outlined his views on why distant language comparisons are very difficult because of the progressive loss of data , yet he is not in the business of criticizing people who attempt these . he is in the business of himself contributing to a deepening of both linguistic and mythological comparisons as much as he can in areas which are still to a great extent uncharted . johanna nichols also provoked much thought with her methods , and ways of integrating more information on peripheries vs . centers of innovation and residue of repeated waves of innovation visible even at the peripheries , as a pattern to look for in projecting a homeland backwards in time . i am somewhat skeptical about very distant language comparisons which involve only identities of sound correspondence , precisely because it is so easy for this approach to select a very old but still relatively more recent layer of borrowings ( more recent than the node on the family tree we may be struggling to find a way to reach ) . as greenberg pointed out , an increase in the number of conditioning contexts over time , once it approaches the number of lexical items available for comparison , leads to the result that there are virtually no recurrences of exactly the same sound correspondences . please see a separate message on how we can sharpen our tools to deal with this , titled "" typology of historical change "" . this means that i start out somewhat skeptical about alan bomhard 's nostratic and similar comparisons , precisely because he uses only or preferentially sound correspondences of identity . but that may be my personal bias , and i may end up granting that such a strictness of sound correspondences can actually work over great time depths . i cannot presume to know . there was one session i did not attend but report here from the abstract , in which researchers reported results of mitochondrial dna studies of the various native american populations . as expected , eskimo and athabaskan were separable ( one variety each ? ) . the remainder of native american populations shared four varieties of mitochondrial dna , either without subgrouping , or perhaps in two major subgroups . bob rankin did attend and says that the authors in their presentation had come down on the side of two major subgroups . population genetics need not match language directly , but the data is still at least interesting and obliquely relevant . . . lloyd anderson",Safe Email

"gnbt fact sheet generex biotechnology corporation . investor fact sheet at a glance : symbol nasdaqsc : gnbt price ( 3 / 4 / 05 ) : $ 0 . 61 52 - week high / low : $ 0 . 58 / $ 1 . 86 av . volume ( 3 - mo ) : 303 , 681 shares outstanding : 34 . 76 million float : 29 . 6 million % held by insiders : 14 . 83 % market capitalization : $ 21 . 20 million cash : * $ 1 . 76 million long - tem debt : * $ 935 , 000 revenue * * $ 710 , 000 * as of 10 / 31 / 04 * * 12 months ended 10 / 31 / 04 insulin without pain , ready for market - - generex biotechnology ( nasdaqsc : gnbt ) has developed oral - lyn  , an oral insulin spray for the treatment of diabetes , thereby replacing insulin injections . - - after 10 years of development , oral - lyn  has been found to be as effective as injected insulin and is ready for commercialization . - - sales could start as early as the first half of 2005 in south america . canada and europe is the next target market , with u . s . and europe to follow . - - diabetes is growing at epidemic rates . hundreds of millions suffer from type 1 , type 2 or pre - diabetes . even modest penetration of the worldwide diabetes market would translate into revenues in the billion - dollar range . - - generex  s delivery system , rapidmist  , has the potential to replace injected drugs , including morphine , fentanyl , heparin and flu vaccine . why buy now generex biotechnology is a toronto - based , delaware corporation with a market - ready solution to a central challenge in diabetes treatment  ending the pain and hassle of insulin injections . ever since scientists early in the 20 th century learned that diabetes was caused by the body  s inability to produce a normal supply of insulin , patients have had to administer insulin by injection . alternatives that have been developed in recent years  pumps or needle - less  pens   are still invasive and / or expensive . pharmaceutical companies have tried to develop a truly non - invasive insulin product that is pain - free , easy to use and free from serious side effects . among today  s competing technologies , only oral - lyn  , an insulin spray to treatment diabetes , meets all those tests . after 10 years of development , oral - lyn  is ready for market and is set to produce enormous revenue growth for the company . generex is little known outside a small community of investors focused on drug delivery and diabetes treatment . in the next few months , however , the expected commercial entry of oral - lyn  in south america could raise generex  s profile sharply , with a commensurate rise in their share price . small companies in drug and medical - device development are , of course , inherently high - risk investments . but aggressive investors who take an early stake in these firms can profit several times over . generex has the profile of being one such potential winner . readers are advised that this investor fact sheet is intended for informational use only . anyone interested in obtaining more detailed information about the company should contact generex biotechnology ( generex ) or investor relations international ( iri ) . this investment profile was developed as part of an overall investor relations program with iri . iri has been retained by generex to provide investor relations advisory services , for which iri receives compensation in the form of cash . this investment fact sheet is intended solely for informational purposes and is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the company ' s stock . this investment fact sheet is based upon information available to the public , as well as other information from sources deemed reliable , but is not guaranteed as being accurate nor does it purport to be complete . this investment fact sheet may contain forward -

"Use the GUI and don't delete files, use the other option, whats it called
again, the dustbin or something ;-)Conor who only knows about symbolic links ;-))I'm pretty sure that I have a softlink from
/mnt/public/mnt/public/downloads/Linux/wasteCPU/setiathome to
/home/cwynne/setiThe /mnt/pub....../seti.. directory resides on an external raidvolume and
/home/../seti is on the internal IDE2 drive. 
So I dont have to cd around the gaf. I suppose that would count as across
different devices. If you're wondering [probably not] why /mnt/public is there twice, its
because I restored from tapebackup and I didn't know that it keeps the
directory structure. I know now ;-)Actually, how can I fix that quickly and easily? I thought about firstly
mv'ing the structure to /tmp. Then copying it back again but I'm sure some
wee genius knows a quickie solution. Mind you I never even bothered trying a
its not a priority now that its all linked anyway. CW--------------------------------
 hum.  interesting variation on the classic technique of
 redefining `rm' to `mv' the files into `./.trash/' (or
 with a prefix of `#' or a suffix of `~'; the variations
 are endless).  these classic techniques only provide a
 means to roll back accidental `rm's, so there is still
 considerable scope for data lost as there are other ways
 of deleting files --- which is not a problem for this
 hard link idea. but, like the classic techniques, there is no rolling
 back of accidental overwrites. ( rolling back overwrites reminds me of the ""snapshot""
  facility on NetWork Appliance fileservers.  and of the
  various ""versioning"" filesystems which appeared --- and
  then vanished? --- over the years.... ) one severe(?) gotcha is some files shouldn't have any
 hard links.  both RCS *,v (and hence CVS) and SCCS s.*
 files are like this --- the RCS(/CVS?)/SCCS toolsets
 complain if there are hard links.cheers,

"update on lodi and wheeler ridge storage projects western undeterred by grueling regulatory process expressing frustration but continuing its resolve , texas - based western hub properties is ironing out some "" technical issues "" of financing with california regulators and now expects to start construction in february on its delayed lodi gas storage field in northern california . the merchant storage project will be operating by this time next year , said western hub ' s california - based manager , jim fossum , who added that with faster approvals , the project could have been in service during this summer ' s electricity generating crunch and the current gas and power shortages . despite the regulatory struggle , he said the company still plans to go through with its other california storage project near bakersfield and the natural gas hub called wheeler ridge . western has acquired leases on the property it needs and will start more detailed engineering of the proposed site over the first three to six months of next year . the company intends to make a filing with state regulators in summer of 2001 . in both the approved lodi project ( see daily gpi , may 19 ) and the proposed wheeler ridge storage field , western is not concerned about lining up customers , said fossum . the projects are not contingent on contracts , he said . "" now that we are a bona fide ( certified plant ) utility under the california public utilities commission , we are getting some technical things worked out with the commission staff and nailing down the last small pieces of property , fossum said . "" everything is basically ready to go at lodi "" "" we have to file with them documents that verify certain aspects of the project ' s financing . we can ' t move ahead with the financing until the cpuc approves it . "" if we had not encountered all of the roadblocks that we have had , we could have helped with the problems this last summer , and we could be helping with problems right now . "" he added that the project would not be operational in time to have any impact on the upcoming summer electricity demand and corresponding heavy natural gas demand to fuel power plants . lodi and the wheeler ridge storage project are being designed as high - deliverability storage facilities . lodi will have about 9 bcf of working capacity , building to 12 bcf . initially , fossum said , lodi should have about 400 mmcf / d injection capability and 500 mmcf / d withdrawal . in the southern half of the state , western for some time has been doing reservoir studies near wheeler ridge and now has a "" couple of reservoirs that we think might work , "" fossum said . "" we ' re in the preliminary planning phase . "" the wheeler ridge project would have an ultimate working capacity of 12 to 16 bcf and similar 500 mmcf / d deliverability at its peak . he said western hopes to have something operational in the wheeler ridge area by the end of 2002 .",Safe Email

"eia ' s latest forecast of pricing and supply for the winter eia predicts supply shortfall will linger through winter the energy information administration said yesterday in its september short - term energy outlook it is projecting natural gas prices at the wellhead will increase by about 87 % this winter ( october - march ) compared to last winter . residential prices for gas are expected to rise on average by 27 % compared to last year . for the entire year , the average wellhead price for natural gas is projected to be $ 3 . 40 / mcf , the highest annual wellhead price on record ( in inflation - adjusted terms , it would be the highest annual average price since 1985 ) . the short - term supply constraints that are currently hindering the industry ' s ability to meet storage and power generation demand at the same time are likely to continue into the heating season , eia said . storage levels could end up being about 8 % below the five - year average of about 3 , 000 bcf by the start of winter if net injections continue at 10 % below historically average rates through the remainder of the refill season . the effects of increased drilling for gas are not expected to appear in the form of significantly increased production until after the next heating season , according to the agency ' s report . "" for now , we are continuing to maintain a conservative view of possible increases in domestic gas production for 2000 and 2001 , with assumed increases of 0 . 5 % and 1 % , respectively , for this year and next . . . , "" the eia report stated . "" on the other hand , the u . s . natural gas rig count on aug . 25 was at a recent high of 794 rigs . exploration and production budgets for many natural gas producers are expected to increase sharply in 2000 and 2001 , spurred by higher prices and greatly improved current and expected revenues from producing assets . also on the positive side , data from the texas railroad commission suggest that , through may , year 2000 gas production increased , if only slightly ( 0 . 4 % ) . this signifies a turnaround ( however modest ) in a key producing region . very high gas drilling rates , including a record - setting pace in deep offshore gulf of mexico , confirm that increasingly positive results for domestic gas production are under way . "" imports are projected to rise by about 12 % next year primarily because of the 1 . 35 bcf / d alliance pipeline coming on line next month . meanwhile the demand outlook remains bullish at 4 . 2 % annual growth . in 2001 , however , the forecast has been revised downward to 2 . 5 % growth because of higher than expected natural gas prices . the industrial sector is the leading sector for demand increases in 2000 at 9 . 3 % , while electric utility demand is expected to decline by 4 . 0 % primarily because of power plant sales . for the power generation sector as a whole , gas demand is expected to grow 6 . 5 % this year and 1 . 5 % in 2001 . eia said the reduced growth rate next year is largely due to the reversal in relative prices of fuel oil and natural gas , which began in august , with fuel oil gaining the price advantage as gas prices continued to rise . gas demand this winter is expected to be up by 5 . 7 % compared to last winter if weather is normal . normal weather implies a 12 % rise in heating degree - days compared with last winter .",Safe Email

Tuesday October 8, 2002
The GuardianEvangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust
Rowan Williams, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, before he even takes
up his post, by threatening to take ""direct action"" against him.
The council of the Church Society, the Church of England's oldest
evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform,
which is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant his
supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down.
Following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met
the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his
appointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him.
The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to
destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded
with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement.
Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams's acknowledgement that he has
ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who
have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The new
archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the
church.
Nevertheless, the society said: ""It is clear that he prefers his private
judgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the
common mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.
""The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan
Williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand
down,"" it said.
The society claimed to have drawn up an ""action plan,"" including calling on
bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of
which archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from
Dr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be
""taking steps towards appropriate direct action"".
It added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal
called Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles
allegedly commending homosexual behaviour.
Despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the
church. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown
appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his
appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.
He is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be
formally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.
Asked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the
society's chairman, said: ""Watch this space."" Presumably it could involve a
small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking
alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams
is present.
Church of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down
during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the
evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the
absence of a robust rebuttal.
A letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the
evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical
teaching.
On the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of
Westcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption
and blackmail. ""It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is
attempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get
your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,"" she said.
Last week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. ""Matters of sexuality
should not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church
Society have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his
appointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take
the post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God.""

"like HP is using the DMCA to prevent full disclosure of security vulnerablities. This is not a good precedent... ----- Forwarded message from Vladimir Katalov -----From: Vladimir Katalov Reply-To: Vladimir Katalov Organization: ElcomSoft Co.Ltd. Subject: [DMCA_Discuss] Security warning draws DMCA threat Date: Wed, 31 Jul 2002 15:04:26 +0400 http://news.com.com/2100-1023-947325.html?tag=fd_topBy Declan McCullagh Staff Writer, CNET News.com July 30, 2002, 4:48 PM PTWASHINGTON--Hewlett Packard has found a new club to use to pound researchers who unearth flaws in the company's software: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.Invoking both the controversial 1998 DMCA and computer crime laws, HP has threatened to sue a team of researchers who publicized a vulnerability in the company's Tru64 Unix operating system.In a letter sent on Monday, an HP vice president warned SnoSoft, a loosely organized research collective, that it ""could be fined up to $500,000 and imprisoned for up to five years"" for its role in publishing information on a bug that lets an intruder take over a Tru64 Unix system.HP's dramatic warning appears to be the first time the DMCA has been invoked to stifle research related to computer security. Until now, it's been used by copyright holders to pursue people who distribute computer programs that unlock copyrighted content such as DVDs or encrypted e-books.If HP files suit or persuades the federal government to prosecute, the company could set a precedent that stifles research into computer security flaws, a practice that frequently involves publishing code that demonstrates vulnerabilities. The DMCA restricts code that ""is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing protection"" of copyrighted works.On July 19, a researcher at SnoSoft posted a note to SecurityFocus.com's popular Bugtraq mailing list with a hyperlink to a computer program letting a Tru64 user gain full administrator privileges. The researcher, who goes by the alias ""Phased,"" said in the message: ""Here is the warez, nothing special, but it does the job.""That public disclosure drew the ire of Kent Ferson, a vice president in HP's Unix systems unit, who alleged in his letter on Monday that the post violated the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.[...]_______________________________________________ ------------------------ http://www.anti-dmca.org ------------------------DMCA_Discuss mailing list DMCA_Discuss@lists.microshaft.org http://lists.microshaft.org/mailman/listinfo/dmca_discuss----- End forwarded message ----- http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",Safe Email

"update : ffvols ted , an update on the implementation for ffvols : ( 1 ) in comparing 6 days of historical var calculations ( with that of the implied ) for agg - gas , we have found that the historical var calculations are consistently lower over this period , by roughly 17 mm . the implied volatilities are much higher at this period , anticipating strong winter prices . ( 2 ) at this time , the consensus is not to relase the historical implementation into production , and the official line to traders will be that the method is still in testing . the historical var is 19 . 2 mm and the implied is 37 mm for effective date of 09 / 25 . ( 3 ) further testing is in progress on a hybrid methodology ( which i mentioned last week , whereby historical vols are scaled by the ratio of prompt to historical - prompt volatilities ) , to atleast capture some implied / forward effects . tanya ' s analysis on a fictitious portfolio indicates higher var numbers , but poorer backtesting in comparison to the historical approach . this approach serves as an intermediate , and seems appropriate in periods such as the current one , wherein the historical numbers might be considerably lower than those of the implied . ( 4 ) winston will start testing using these hybrid vols , and if the results are deemed satisfactory , that will be the production methodology . of course , we will obtain all var numbers concurrently to serve as different indicators and beacons of risk . the production number will hopefully be a sensible compromise of the different methods . regards naveen",Safe Email

steve cooper february 14 , 2002 hi everybody , this is steve cooper . it is february 14 , so happy valentine ' s day to everybody . i just wanted to bring everybody up to speed on a number of items - i want to make sure that i keep you all in the loop so everyone has a pretty good sense of what ' s going on . first of all , i want to thank a number of you for some very nice voice mails or emails . they ' ve been very supportive and i thank you for that . i do intend to get back to everybody personally -

organizable platform here , so that the company can move forward . there was some bad news with respect to enron stock . as far as i can tell , the claims base here - that is bank debt , bond holder debt and other unsecured creditors debt - is going to overwhelm the reorganized value of whatever platform that we move forward . as a result , it ' s not probable that there will any residual value for existing shareholders . that ' s not good news . it ' s an unfortunate result of this problem , and i wish it was different . but i don ' t want you to be misled and i don ' t want any of you to believe that there is value there , because i don ' t think there will be . in particular i don ' t want you to continue to invest your earnings in enron stock without being aware of , at least in my view , shareholder value at the end of the day . the media sometimes interprets the elimination of existing shareholder value as a sign that this is going to be a liquidation . i don ' t believe that will be the case here . i think we have a tough road to hoe . i think that it is going to require us to rebuild credibility in this company and its management team . none the less , i do believe that we are going to have a reorganization here , and i ' m absolutely committed and dedicated to making that happen . a couple of other things that i want you to be aware of : as soon as the dust settles around the reformation of the management team , we will get out a memo as to who the new management team will be and what their roles , responsibilities are . we are continuing to shape and push forward with the creditors committee a retention and severance program , which i know is important to all of you . as that gets cemented , i will provide you with additional updates . and another thing , i ' ve asked a number of our colleagues to plan in early to mid - march , an employee meeting at one of these local hotels . it will , more likely than not , be in the evening and it can go as late as you want it to go . what i thought we would do is give everybody , in a plain vanilla way , a short presentation as to where we are going and how we intend to get there . then we will have a giant question and answer session , so that if any of you have concerns , issues , problems , or upsets , we can get it all out on the table and figure out collectively the best way to deal with these things . that ' s where we stand as of valentine ' s day . once again , i would like to thank all of those of you who have given me some real nice emails and voicemails for your support . again , i apologize that i haven ' t been able to get back to you as quickly as i would like , but i promise you i will and i hope everybody has a great day . if you have any questions or issues , send me an email , give me a buzz or drop by my office . i would be more than happy to have a chat with you . happy valentine ' s day . thanks again so much and i ' ll give you the next update as soon as practicably possible .",Safe Email

"n - ary vs . binary lloyd anderson asks how n-ary ( for n greater than 2 ) comparison could ever be worse than binary . consider the problem of heads and tails when we toss coins . what are the chances of two coins ( standing for two languages obviously ) both coming up the same ( i . e . , both heads or both tails ) when tossed once ? since there are four possible outcomes of the binary toss , namely , hh , ht , tt , and th , and only two where both come up the same , the chances are 50 % . but now consider what happens when we toss three coins ( standing for three languages ) . since a coin only has two sides , in each possible outcome at least two of the coins come up the same . so the chances of 2 out of 3 coming up the same ( which would correspond to saying let two out of three languages agree in something and then they are related ) are 100 % ( which means this is not a valid test for relatedness ) . of course , if we had wanted all 3 out 3 to come up the same , then the situation would be drastically different , but in linguistics n-ary comparison never to my knowledge involves such a requirement . however , the only reason that n-ary comparison does so poorly here is that ( a ) there are only two possible outcomes per language , i . e . , languages come in only two varieties , and ( b ) the number of languages being compared is small ( only three ) . the ( a ) part is the one where real linguistic applications are drastically different from our little coin-tossing game ( since when you look for language relationships , you are looking at hundreds or thousands or maybe even more possibilities , not two , because you are looking at phonological shapes of morphemes mostly , and these allow lots of possibilities , at least thousands ) . so in the real situations that alone insures that n-ary comparison is better than binary . but it is also true that if you increase the number of coins ( languages ) in ( b ) , that also has the same effect . but you still have to be careful : the main concern is that given n languages being compared you must worry about how many out of the n are required to agree and about not making that number too small ( if you do , then again chance tends to take over ) . which raises a question : is there any published work on comparing languages which explicitly calculates these numbers ( and does it right ) ? alexis mr",Safe Email

"re : pg & e texas meeting recap of pg & e texas meeting 4 / 12 / 00 . volume issues : ? sherlyn schumack will provide stacey neuweiler with volume variances by day and contract as soon as possible ( preferably the same day allocation is received ) . ? stacey will notify sherlyn of correct volume or status if further research is necessary as soon as possible . ? sherlyn will notify logistics , stacey , and lorraine of pg & e texas of interconnect variances by day . ? each group will respond promptly to ensure payment can be made through the system , eliminating manual line items on invoice . ? charlotte hawkins will see what was confirmed on the outstanding interconnect issue for 2 / 00 , and daren or charlotte will make the necessary correction . rate issues : ? heidi withers will pull daily rates from pg & e texas bulletin board . ? greg steagall will provide heidi with service verification ( s ) and the daily allocation summary received from pg & e texas during close , which shows rates from pg & e texas . ? no action will be taken on rate variances where pg & e was paid per their invoice . heidi has talked with brenda herod , and brenda is okay with this course of action . ? there are four invoices from 1999 production where pg & e was underpaid , so heidi and greg will work to correct those months to pay pg & e correctly . there are no open invoices in settlements . ? it was noted that manual line items are not to be used to pay pg & e per their invoice in the future . we expect to correct issues in the system prior to the due date of the invoice unless there is a valid disagreement between ena and pg & e . if ena has a valid disagreement , we will pay per ena  , s verification . daren has put in a request for legal to transfer the ena transport contracts to hpl . this would eliminate stacey having to schedule the transport on ena as well as the desk to desk deal . it would also prevent sherlyn from having to allocate the transport expense contract and the brokered desk to desk deal . he has not had a response from legal yet .",Safe Email
"global entelligence status just want to give you a couple of updates . the prototype of the market penetration window was shown to jennifer fraser and chris gaskill yesterday . the overall response was very positive . based on this , it will provide a firmer estimate for delivery of phase i by the end of the week . the cost for the d & b data has been reduced by $ 100 k after additional negotiations . pursuant to that , the agreement was signed last week . the requested data was received yesterday . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by mary solmonson / hou / ect on 03 / 21 / 2000 09 : 55 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mary solmonson 03 / 07 / 2000 05 : 50 pm to : greg whalley / hou / ect @ ect cc : sally beck / hou / ect @ ect subject : global entelligence status just wanted to let you know a few updates : 1 ) we have a full it team now ready to go . we are going to prototype the first window , market penetration . the prototype will give us something with sample data to show various traders to get additional feedback on functionality . hopefully , we will have something in 2 weeks . 2 ) the previous cost estimates still stand until we have more feedback from the prototype . the estimates are $ 1 . 6 m for phase i and $ 1 . 6 m for remaining phases . 3 ) included in the cost estimate is a figure of $ 389 k for the purchase of customer prospect data from dun & bradstreet . the $ 389 k is an o & m expense amount that was not included in the 2000 budget . this amount combined with other amounts ena did budget for or will spend with d & b results in an overall budget impact over the next 12 months of $ 278 k . i spoke with george wasaff in strategic sourcing this morning at the request of philippe bibi . george has some ideas for negotiating a better deal from d & b . either he will get more customer records for the price or negotiate better terms for a longer term on the recurring contract with d & b . this could take some time and push us late on getting the data scrubbed and ready to go for implementation . i believe i can give george some time to try something , but when it comes down to it , $ 389 k isn ' t that much money . therefore , i suggest that if we don ' t have anything negotiated in the next three weeks , we sign the current proposal from d & b and move forward . d & b is currently threatening ( a negotiation tactic , i think ) to pull their development resources off of this project until they receive a signed agreement . in the event this comes to pass and adversely impacts our delivery of global entelligence , we can provide a letter of intent to keep them moving or sign the proposal at that time . give me a call at 3 - 6079 if you have any comments on any of the above items .",Safe Email

"" that motivated me to prepare the appended item . please feel free to pass it around . tony woodbury * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * counting eskimo words for snow : a citizen 's guide lexemes referring to snow and snow-related notions in steven a . jacobson 's ( 1984 ) yup ' ik eskimo dictionary [ 1 ] anthony c . woodbury university of texas at austin july 1991 this is a list of lexemes referring to snow and related notions in one eskimo language , central alaskan yupik ( or just yup ' ik eskimo ) . it is spoken by about 13 , 000 people in the coast and river areas of southwestern alaska from norton sound to bristol bay . it is one of five eskimo languages . ( of these five , probably the best-known is inuit , spoken in a series of well-differentiated dialects ranging from northern alaska , all across the canadian far north , and up to the coast of greenland . while the term inuit is preferred to eskimo by many in canada , the term is retained here because ( a ) it properly refers to any eskimo group , not only the inuit ; and ( b ) its use is widespread in native communities in alaska . ) this is a list of lexemes rather than of words . roughly , a lexeme can be thought of as an independent vocabulary item or dictionary entry . it 's different from a word since a lexeme can give rise to more than one distinctly inflected word . thus english has a single lexeme _ speak _ which gives rise to inflected forms like _ speaks _ , _ spoke _ , and _ spoken _ . it 's especially important to count lexemes rather than words when talking about eskimo languages . that 's because they are inflectionally so complicated that each single noun lexeme may have about 280 distinct inflected forms , while each verb lexeme may have over 1000 ! obviously , that would put the number of snow words through the roof very quickly . the list is organized according to lexeme * meanings * . perhaps somewhat arbitrarily i have counted fifteen of them , placing within each of them noun and / or verb lexemes having the same basic sense . and perhaps even more arbitrarily , i ' ve grouped these fifteen meanings into four larger sets . but the most arbitrary decision of all is left to the discretion of the reader-the decision of how to count the lexemes themselves . here are some of the problems you face : ( a ) are all fifteen lexeme meanings really 's now ' - meanings ? that is , do words with these meanings really count for you as words for snow ? [ 2 ] ( b ) there are some synonyms present - - alternative lexemes with the same meaning , like garbage vs . trash in english . are you going to count them separately , or together ? ( c ) if you decided to count synonyms together , will you also count together both of the members of noun-verb pairs having basically the same meaning ? ( the members are , technically speaking , separate lexemes since partly idiosyncratic morphological changes mark the verbal forms , and must therefore be listed separately in any truly informative dictionary , as indeed jacobson 's dictionary does . ) ( d ) following jacobson , i ' ve specially labelled those lexemes that only occur in a small subpart of the central alaskan yupik - speaking region . are you going to try to make counts for each separate dialect ? if yes , you will wonder if you really have enough information to do so . ( you ' re not alone in this-such information is difficult to compile , whether or not you are a linguist , and also whether or not you are a native speaker of a language . ) [ 3 ] a . snow particles ( 1 ) snowflake qanuk 's nowflake ' qanir - ' to snow ' qanunge - ' to snow ' [ nun ] qanugglir - ' to snow ' [ nun ] ( 2 ) frost kaneq ' frost ' kaner - ' be frosty / frost sth .

> > Of course, it would require a minimum of EUR300,000 in funding

> It would?Well, yes, if I were to add all the frilly pink bits and the crunchy
chocolate flavoured pieces... :)Seriously, I can only see two reasons to start another distro: you have
something fundamentally different to offer, or you are customising an
existing distro for an unusual and specific situation. Between
Mandrake/YellowDog, RedHat/SuSe and Debian you have enough options to cover
most day-to-day requirements. And a lot of the specific situations are
already covered (smoothwall, familiar, etc.)Therefore, if I were to create a new Linux distribution, I would have to
spend time crafting it so that it offers a lot more than existing
alternatives. My requirements normally involve better support/easier
maintenance, and if one follows the logic through, this would require a
company to be behind such an initiative.I imagine it would be possible to create a new distribution in about one
week[1]. For example: take Debian as your base, slap a specific set of
packages on CD, change a few config files, mention that it has been untested
on most hardware variations, and voila, a ""new"" distie. :)- Matthew[1] That is, IT weeks. 1 IT week ~= two months. :)

But no.
Previously (v1.0.6 of GnuPG) there would be a slight pause at this point while
it went out to get the public key from a keyserver.
Now, whether I have the key or NOT, I get the failure message.Its as if it cant find gpg to execute it (but I fixed that path), so there
must be something else that I am missing...

"http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/printer.jsp?CID=1051-080802A>Mail Me the Money!
>By David Friedman 08/08/2002David is a very bright fellow. But this time he's
several years behind. The idea of using epostage
to stop spam has been discussed quite a bit. The
problem is how to get over the adoption hump.
Until most people are taking one form of epostage,
most people don't have enough incentive to download
and install something that allows them to pay it.
Until most people are set up to pay it, any form of
epostage I require closes my mailbox to unknown
senders from whom I want to receive mail. And even
from known senders. Giving someone my email address
doesn't automatically put them in my white list.Hashcash tries to lower the adoption barrier by
removing the need to pay money for epostage.
Instead, the sender burns processing time on his
computer, answering a cryptographically hard
challenge. But even this requires set-up. There is
inadequate incentive to do so until there is a
standard mechanism, but no standard mechanism is
born until a significant fraction of the market
has taken that first step. It may take government
action, to institute an effective epostage
standard!I think the better idea is to require that people
off your white list ""hand sign"" email to you. A
couple of companies are now trying to implement
this. An email sender, if not on your white list,
must respond to a verification email or go to a
website, by a process that is very simply for a
human sender, but difficult for a spammer to
automate. Where epostage requires a standard
mechanism, a variety of mechanisms for ""hand
signing"" would frustrate spammers while making it
no more difficult for legitimate senders. I'm
hoping Eudora and some of the other big mail
clients incorporate this kind of feature. The
advantage to putting this in the mail client is
that the required ""hand sign"" can be personalized:  ""Your attempt to email David Friedman is
  blocked until you fill in the blank: The
  Incredible ______ Machine.""It will be a long time before spammers have a
process that defeats millions of personal
challenges. On the other hand, I have a hack in
mind that would work a large percentage of the
time. But I'm not telling. If spammers did figure
out such hacks, people would then improve their
challenges. Yeah, this would lead to another
arms race, and spam would leak through to the
unwitting. But this arms race is one that helps
spammers identify and target the part of the
population whose challenges are sub-par, which
is their natural prey. People like David aren't
in the market for herbal Viagra or back alley
debt consolidation.Since David is an anarchist, I'm surprised he
didn't point out that spam is the result of
government. The government is ineffective at
preventing spam, but it DOES prevent individuals
and ISPs from taking retribution against spammers.

"Evening Standard - 28 August 2002[Deft use of Fortean Unit of Measurement in 2nd para - MA] 'Lost' penguins found alive
 
 by Charles Miranda A colony of emperor penguins which was thought to have starved to death in
 Antarctica has been found alive in a ""big huddle"".  The birds were spotted by the crew of a USAF jet returning to base in New
 Zealand. Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica
 had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. 
 
 Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made
 it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in
 October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: ""The
 penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a
 successful breeding season over the winter."" 
 
 Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall
 and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research
 station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the
 cape, may have lost up to third of its population.

I haven't been by their website in quite some time, so when 
Hal Goldstein informed me of a new electronic delivery 
method that they've employed, I felt obligated to give it a 
spin. You can check out the September 2002 Issue of the Digital

format better than the print variety. A Software and 
Accessories Encyclopedia is also new to the site since my 
last belated visit.I've also been using my PocketPC quite a bit lately, but 
not for data. It's found a more frequent home on my belt as 
an MP3 player ever since Diana's dad gave us a bicycle. 
Going out for a morning ride has been quite pleasurable, and 
it's nice to bring along some tunes. I've tried both the 
Compaq iPaq 3870 and HP Jornada 565, and have been more 
pleased with the audio ability of the iPaq, due in part to 
the sound utility Compaq provides to adjust treble and bass 
levels. It's just a more full-sounding device, in my 
opinion. See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeNETWORK
LDAP Whodunit
Pondered by Warren Dugas""Randy, a little question for you: Do you know what LDAP is and how important it is to the world of technology? I'm sure you do - but where did it come from? Hmm, let's put our thinking caps on and try to figure it out. Did Microsoft create it? Hmm - No, how about Novell? Nope. Well, who then?""History of LDAP http://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/prodtechnol/winntas/evaluate/featfunc/ldapcmr.asp
X.500, the OSI directory standard, defines a 
comprehensive Directory Service, including an information 
model, namespace, functional model, and authentication 
framework. X.500 also defines the Directory Access Protocol 
(DAP) used by clients to access the directory. DAP is a full 
OSI protocol that contains extensive functionality, much of 
which is not used by most applications. DAP is significantly more complicated than the more 
prevalent TCP/IP stack implementations and requires more 
code and computing horsepower to run. The size and 
complexity of DAP makes it difficult to run on thin clients, 
such as the PC and Macintosh where TCP/IP functionality 
often comes with the machine. DAP stack implementations are 
cumbersome to administer, thus limiting the acceptance of 
X.500. Hence in 1993, the folks at University of Michigan, 
with help from the ISODE Consortium, designed and developed 
a protocol that would work over TCP/IP and was small enough 
when implemented to run on a thin client like PC's running 
the Windowsï¿½ operating system or the Macintosh. The LDAP version 1 Specification was published in March 
of 1994. The LDAP version 2 Specification was published as 
rfc 1777 by the Access Searching and Indexing of Directories 
(ASID) working group in the IETF in March of 1995. In April 
of 1996, 40 companies including Microsoft, Netscape, and 
Novell separately announced support for LDAP protocol in 
their Directory Services products in order that they may in 
turn operate with each other and integrate with the 
Internet. LDAP version 3.0 has gone through several drafts 
but at this time is not finished.

Looking for Sound
Suggested by Corey Holletthttp://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/santacruz/whatdoineed.asp
http://www.3dsoundsurge.com/reviews/earlyimpressions/ProMedia51.html
""I've just gone on an extensive hunt for the best 
sound card and speaker set combination for 5.1 sound. My 
criteria were that it be excellent for games, music, and dvd 
playback. A price under $500.00 was also a strong 
point.""
Corey came to the same conclusion that others have in two 
respects. Creative has long maintained a healthy share of 
the sound card market with a solid name and decent products. 
Audiophiles know of other brands as well, such as Turtle 
Beach and Philips, which also produce quality sound cards 
and at attractive price points. Corey decided on the Turtle 
Beach Santa Cruz card, a great choice. His choice of speaker systems reinforced my own feelings 
on the subject. I own two Klipsch speaker sets, the ProMedia 
2.400 and most recently the ProMedia 5.1. The 2.400 system 
was the subject of many positive reviews, and believe me 
when I say that the ProMedia 5.1 leaves the 2.400 in the 
dust. The above review that Corey pointed out hits the high 
points, and is actually quite in-depth for an ""initial"" 
review. I'm itching to see if they eventually do write up a 
more complete version, as mentioned in the article.

QuickTime 6 Released
http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/
With the debut of QuickTime 6, we can assume that the 
licensing haggles over MPEG-4 have been resolved, making way 
for the long-awaited release. MPEG-4 isn't the only 
addition, joining a new AAC audio codec that is a favorite 
among professionals. Streaming media skip protection, Flash 
5 support and better AppleScript functionality also tag 
along. As always, there is a standard free version available 
for download, but the Pro edition adds additional features, 
such as full screen video playback, the ability to create 
MPEG-4 content and editing features not present in the free 
player.

Microtel & WalMart Love Linux
http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26192.html
WalMart is selling Microtel PCs, but with a slight twist. 
They were one of the first manufacturers to preinstall 
LindowsOS and offer systems to the retail market through 
WalMart.com, and now Mandrake is being offered as a pre-
installed choice in operating systems. These options give 
potential Linux users an easier way to get started without 
having to build their own system from scratch or deal with 
driver issues, while still maintaining a low overall cost. A 
Pentium 4 2GHz system with a CD-RW drive goes for as little 
as $648 with Mandrake Linux, so not too shabby at all.

I thought I baked my Dell PowerEdge 1400SC server yesterday 
when it refused to boot completely. I borrowed a data vac 
from a friend and decided to clean all of the dust and cat 
hair from my systems, then after reconnecting everything, 
the server would boot to the initial splash screen, where 
there is a POST progress bar, but would not proceed past 
past about the first 1/5th of the bar. Uh-oh. What did I 
fry?As it turns out, it was another case of ""always check the 
small stuff"". Oh, I had all of the cables plugged back in to 
the server properly, I checked all of that, but it didn't 
dawn on me until about a half dozen boot attempts later that 
I should probably turn an eye toward the other end of the 
cables. That server is connected to an 8-port Compaq KVM 
switch and with all of the yanking, plucking and shuffling, 
the keyboard cable had been eeked out of the switch just a 
tad. Why the server didn't display a keyboard warning 
message like every other computer on the planet, I can only 
attribute to the BIOS developers. Server Satchel, running 
Red Hat Linux 7.2 is now operating as it was previously. The 
penguin is happy. The server case is even black. How 
appropriate...See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeNETWORK

ATI Still Makes Video Cards?
http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1656
Say it isn't so! Yes, apparently they do still have 
something to say about NVIDIA's dominance in the video card 
market. Seeing as how they've been all but dumped by the 
majority of top-tier system makers, it's hard to believe 
that they are capable of a serious comeback. Judging from 
what AnandTech has to say about the forthcoming R300-based 
cards, it appears that they haven't thrown in the towel just 
yet. I'm all for competition, so I welcome the effective re-
entrance into the high end market. Let's all hope that their 
driver development has improved as much as their hardware 
seems to have.

Technical Censorship

Odd. I liked that cup of Mocha (spelled M-O-C-H-A and I'll explain in a minute) I drank at Starbucks when Jake and I visited last week, but if I wanted to relay that to someone using a Yahoo email account, you might see an alternate word. Thus the additional hyphenated spelling just in case those of you using Yahoo to subscribe to Lockergnome actually received your issues and the word has been altered to suit their personal opinion of my choice in drinks. They've also had a terrible time interpretting our W3C standardized HTML lately, dropping in copious #message references throughout the text in their new Beta email client. So why the text replacement? It's another filtering technique to stop certain words that might relate to JavaScript functions. I guess I'll have to choose another beverage next time. Silly me.Â GnomeSTUFF
Yer Kidding... Really?
http://www.theregus.com/content/4/25629.html
I'm all sorts of sarcastic today, aren't I? Those of us 
that have had to manage budgets are used to dealing with 
math in terms of hardware, software, maintenance and 
personnel costs. It's not really that difficult. It's 
certainly not hard to see that dropping a free version of 
Linux on a server with less hardware requirements just to do 
some file sharing, printing and maybe an Intranet page or 
three is far cheaper than using Windows. At very long last, 
Microsoft has admitted as much. Of course, they're quick to 
point out that they have much more to offer than Linux, 
which may indeed be true. But at the end of the day, when 
you compare donuts to donuts and like functions against one 
another, Linux is cheaper. For a shop of Windows-trained 
staff, dealing with Linux will certainly be a challenge, 
requiring additional training, suffer the odd blunder here 
and there, and be less forgiving when it comes to detailed 
configuration. On the same token, make a Linux whiz use 
Windows and see how quickly you'll be searching for a 
replacement. Cheap is in the budget of the beholder.

"california update 5 / 4 / 01 if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 . bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is reportedly "" unwilling to fight "" for davis . many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would "" double dip "" into the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place . additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult . the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would "" eat "" the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8 billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they will support the bond issuance to go forward . currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab 31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen , currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) . according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature , republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued . other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally , lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan . key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b bear stearns $ 625 m tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 % tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 % current projected blended ir : 5 . 38 % maturity date : august 29 , 2001 for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis . socal edison and bankruptcy at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash . the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan ) stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers , then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments .",Safe Email

have very strange and obscure fantasies (say wanting to be a model)
that dont' require them to be locked up.Fantasies aren't nearly as much like plagues.   Not everyone in a
given population necessarily adheres to that given fantasy, whereas
everyone can get a given plague.   (BTW, gary, the whole concept of
monitoring a given 'racial populaiton' for fear of them getting a
plague is silly.  I don't think plagues discriminate)You're trying to argue for a lock'em all up mentality, when I don't

fantaesies were a psychological? explanation for a possible event.

were found to be stuffed with incontinence pads and bandages.Trading standards officers, working for Greenwich Council, were alerted to 
the situation after a Bryan punch bag, purchased in Argos, in Charlton Road, 
Charlton, was found to be full of bandages.Also stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a 
woman in Fife stating how she felt quite disgusted' about the bag and asking 
for the filling to be tested.The unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag, at Argos, in Lewisham High 
Street, but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was 
horrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads.So far, officers have purchased two of the punch bags, only to find they 
contain incontinence pads and strips of shredded duvet.Cabinet member for public services Councillor Angela Cornforth said: ""This 
is one of the strangest stories I have every heard.""Our officers are in the process of investigating and will no doubt discover 
why the bags contain such unusual contents.""12:18 Tuesday 8th October 2002

um.. http://wwws.sun.com/software/star/gnome/ integrated into solaris.Of course then there's http://wwws.sun.com/software/solaris/freeware/ for

Out of curiosity, does `normal fashion` mean that you still have to do the 
interactive customisations or is it like Solaris jumpstart where you can 
specify everything on the install server, do `boot net - install` go home, and 
come in to a fully installed and patched desktop the next morning?> There are minor problems: like the serial console drivers, but for workstation

I don't see why this should be a _major problem. The prom (ie the ""ok"" prompt) 
is almost at the hardware level and hence dosent depend on the os so you 
should be able to connect to that easily enough. Once the machine is installed 
cant you just log in over the network? The network is the computer after all

hmm... I'm not familiar with wyse stuff, but I only need to use the console 
when something breaks, then anything capable of something basic like vt100 at 
9600 8n1 seems to work  . Not sure why you'd need to worry about this much 
really, just set up jumpstart to install automatically then you don't need to 
look at the console at all.Cheers,

I can't stand to be around

"http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1054           Summary: Split up FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS
           Product: Spamassassin
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: Other
        OS/Version: other
            Status: NEW
          Severity: enhancement

         Component: Rules
        AssignedTo: spamassassin-devel@example.sourceforge.net
        ReportedBy: matt@nightrealms.com
The current FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS triggers on any from where the user name ends
in two or more digits.  I think this should be split up into different
numbers of trailing digits, so that rules with different S/O ratios can
get different scores.  So I've made test rules that look from From
names that end with two, three, four, or five digitis, and one for six or
more digitis; I also put in a test rule that looks for Froms that end in a
single digit, just the sake of completeness.Here is what I got:OVERALL%   SPAM% NONSPAM%     S/O    RANK   SCORE  NAME

because so much of my corpus is made up of Yahoo! Groups traffic, which
seems to have a lot of users that like sticking numbers at the ends of their
names.  Here is the normal stats for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS:  7.024   28.480    2.834    0.91    0.50    0.88  FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMSand my stats: 19.228   34.793   11.991    0.74    0.35    0.88  FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS------- You are receiving this mail because: -------

"sum : ' because ' versus 's ince / as ' ( 6 . 1043 ) i would like to thank the following persons very much for their judgements , comments and various hints concerning my query : marie egan , duncan macgregor , richard ingham , james kirchner , kevin lemoine , david powers , karen ward , yael ziv and especially karen stanley , who took a poll about my claims among her colleagues ( a big thank-you to them too ) . > from the mail i have received by now , the following picture emerges : including the people interviewed by k . stanley , 7 do not agree with my distinction and 5 do agree more or less . some informants suggest other distinctions between the conjunctions : for one , 's ince ' and ' as ' are more formal than ' because ' ( a view which is also presented in some dictionaries and grammars ) , for another , ' as ' is more formal than ' because ' but 's ince ' is "" only suitable for informal conversation but nor for writing "" . the latter judgement seems to be in conformity with a prescriptivist view according to which 's ince ' as a causal conjunction is not to be used at all . ( i want to note that i have identified 209 ( = 13 % ) causal since-clauses among 1576 causal as - , because - , for - and since-clauses in the machine readable british - english lob - corpus ( written texts from 1961 ) . most of these since-clauses are to be found in the category called ' learned and scientific writing ' . ) another informant , for whom my example sentence ( 1 ) is essentially synonymous with either conjunction , has the impression that the speaker of ( 1 ) using ' because ' "" feels john 's admission more noteworthy , or more important to the narrative , than he or she would if 's ince ' or ' as ' were used . "" into the same direction , i assume , goes another judgement according to which ' because ' is "" stronger and more explicit and more exceptional . "" ( i have found a similar view in the literature and have interpreted it as a consequence of my differentiation : entailment on the basis of a rule or norm is intrinsically less noteworthy , less exceptional than ' real ' causation . ) some people have pointed out the relevance of the position of the causal clause . as a tendency , my rule / norm interpretation is considered to be more in accordance with the causal clause ( be it 's ince / as ' or ' because ' ) preceding its main / matrix clause . however , one informant feels "" more comfortable with since clauses preceding , and because clauses following , the main clause . "" ( this impression is somehow in conformity with the statistical situation in the above mentioned lob - corpus : only about 9 % of the because-clauses are preposed , whereas 41 % of the since-clauses and 43 % of the as-clauses are preposed there . ) one informant pointed out constraints which may affect the acceptability of 's ince ' as a causal conjunction : "" 's ince ' seems to have a much more limited application . for me there is a tense / aspect / ? ? ? constraint between the clauses ( consistent with the temporal meaning it also has ? ? ) , otherwise it sounds forced or stilted . i do n't really like your sentence ( 1 ) with 's ince ' . reversing the clauses makes it more acceptable to me , as does changing ' was ' to ' is ' ( strange ! ) . conversely , changing ' has been ' to ' was ' makes the 's ince ' version even less acceptable to me . "" ( probably , the last point in this quotation is caused by the fact that replacement of ' was ' by ' has been ' makes the sentence grammatically acceptable with a temporal interpretation of the since-clause . ) do i have to conclude from the ' empirical ' outcome of my query that my differentiation is not tenable ? for various reasons ( which i hope to develop convincingly in a doctoral dissertation to be submitted soon ) , i do not think so . are there , perhaps , some more people ' out there ' who agree with my claims , but who refrain from simply stating ' i agree ' ? of course , this would not make my query statistically more valid , but it would suggest that there is some plausibility to my non-empirical reasons . carsten breul e-mail : carsten . breul @ rz . ruhr-uni - bochum . de",Safe Email

( otcbb : leth ) current price : 2 . 45 near - term target : 7 . 00 projected high for ' 04 : 15 . 00 we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the most undervalued stock on the otcbb to our millions of subscribers for substantial profits immediately ! sales orders received by leth exceed $ 150 million over the past year while major news was just released that adds multi - millions to the bottom line . leth has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into electrical energy , an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market . ( mar 9 ' 04 ) urgent news update : leth announces the sale of two ( 2 ) biosphere process systems to procura international limited for $ 14 million with an option for the sale of an additional 98 systems over the next 24 months . solving a dual crisis - waste and energy : leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of used tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid . ( mar 3 ' 04 ) leth release major product delivery and net profit news leth delivered 12 biosphere process systems which resulted in a net profit of $ 3 . 5 million , the equivalent of . 12 cents per share . leth is scheduled to receive an additional $ 7 million translating into an additional . 24 cents per share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 months . the net profit per share from just this single contract would value the stock above $ 6 by calculating the . 36 cents per share total at an average industry pe of 18 - 22 . examining leth - by the numbers total assets : 36 . 8 million = 1 . 26 per share of assets cash : 23 . 4 million = . 80 cents per share of cash shares outstanding : 29 million ( down from 31 . 8 million ) after 2 . 8 million shares retired in feb .

( nasdaq : ttek , $ 20 ) a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental , mechanical , and electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government with annual sales of $ 800 million . tetra tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits , installation , and continuous worldwide monitoring of the biosphere process system for leth . tetra tech is now in the process of obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the biosphere process in the state of louisiana . this is a monumental event for leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near - term announcement . stock set to explode on earnings boom : leth has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to achieve record - setting stock price levels in support of the company ' s breakout year . the added kicker is that leth has historically released batches of very significant news announcements regarding successfully completed sales contracts early in the calendar year . we feel that pattern is repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some very big surprises still to come . there aren ' t any companies at any price level with the technology or exponential sales growth to match leth , while simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as global demand to solve two crisis areas , waste and electrical energy , reaches unprecedented levels . required market mover stock report ( mmsr ) information : mmsr cautions that small and micro - cap stocks are high - risk investments and that some or all investment dollars can be lost . we suggest you consult a professional investment advisor before purchasing any stock . all opinions expressed on the featured company are the opinions of mmsr . mmsr recommends you use the information found here as an initial starting point for conducting your own research and your own due diligence on the featured company in order to determine your own personal opinion of the company before investing . mmsr is not an investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accordance with such is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . mmsr is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . mmsr has received twelve thousand dollars from an unaffiliated third party for the preparation of this company profile . since we have received compensation there is an inherent conflict of interest in our statements and opinions . readers of this publication are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements , which are based on certain assumptions and expectations involving various risks and uncertainties , that could cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements . mb nlz",Phishing Email

"sampson : educating eve g . sampson , ( 1997 ) educating eve : the language instinct debate , cassell , london , 184pp . reviewed by feargal murphy , university college dublin . the rise of generative linguistics in 60s gave a new lease of life to the old nature vs . nurture debate . the behaviourist model of language was judged a failure at explaining the process of language acquisition and a new theory of language acquisition emerged . it was rooted in the philosophy of descartes in the 17th century as well as humboldt and , ultimately , plato . it came to be known as linguistic nativism or rationalist linguistics and is most associated with noam chomsky . the central tenet of this theory is that children are born with some kind of language acquisition device already in place in their brains which allows them to acquire the language of their environment . within linguistic nativism there has been some debate as to whether this device provides merely general rules that allow for the acquisition of language or whether it is a rich innate system that provides a complete basis for language acquisition so that a child can acquire the complexities of a language at a time when its general cognitive development could not possibly cope with such complexity . the rationalist tradition behind linguistic nativism has always been in contrast with empiricism which states that all ideas and knowledge ( including knowledge of language ) come from experience obtained through the senses and that there can be no innate knowledge . a view that goes back to the 17th century and the writings of locke , berkeley and hume and in the modern era has also been associated with the philosophers of the vienna circle and karl popper . _ educating eve _ will certainly not determine the outcome of the nature vs . nurture debate , nor will it , in my opinion , lead to any productive insight into the debate . the book fails to understand the scope and import of the nativist arguments and consequently falls short of presenting a genuine criticism of it . as it stands the book will be applauded by those who are already favourably disposed towards its conclusions and derided by those who are not . _ educating eve _ ( henceforth _ ee _ ) argues against the writings of chomsky , as well as pinker 's ' the language instinct ' , bickerton 's ' language and species ' and jackendoff 's ' patterns in the mind ' . these three books are essentially aimed at the general rather than the specialist reader . the result of targeting these three books is to make the arguments against nativism appear weak and superficial . the desire to rescue public opinion from the wrong path is a recurring theme in the author 's work . in his _ language and liberty _ , which also argued for a non-nativist view of language , the main aim was to discourage people from following left wing politics . the author 's politics , unfortunately , emerge as a strong force in this book . given the importance of the nativism debate i shall focus primarily on the more important linguistic issues , leaving aside politics except when they cloud the issues surrounding nativism the alternative to nativism that this book argues for is essentially a version of karl popper 's empiricism . according to this view the ability to learn may be innate but there are no domain specific innate mechanisms involved in learning . people learn the language of the community they belong to in the same way that they learn anything else , by trial and error . they ' make original though fallible conjectures and test them against objective reality ' ( p . 137 - all quotes are from _ ee _ unless otherwise indicated ) . eventually , using this method , each individual comes to learn a language . what they learn are ' wholly cultural constructs ' ( p . 137 ) , an e - language rather than an i - language , to use chomsky 's terminology . note that the conception of language in _ ee _ is totally different from those of chomsky , jackendoff , bickerton or pinker . for these nativists , language cannot belong to a society rather than to the individual . this issue is not actually addressed in the book . _ ee _ merely states that language is a cultural artifact and not biological , but does not furnish any evidence for this claim . the book also states popper 's belief that the mind is not amenable to scientific theorising ( p . 138 ) . i am unable to find any evidence in the book to support this claim . however , if one assumes that the mind is outside the domain of scientific inquiry then it simply becomes impossible to engage in a debate about the merits of the specifics of any nativist theory . the first task this book undertakes is to demolish chomsky 's arguments for nativism ( only sourcing material up to 1991 ) and then to demolish the 's econd wave ' nativists - with pinker foremost in the second wave . the book utilises many arguments , some more noteworthy than others , and it would be beyond the scope of this review to examine them all . i will look at a few of the arguments , more or less at random . the arguments against chomsky centre on what sampson perceives as the basis of nativism : 1 : speed of acquisition 2 : age - dependence 3 : poverty of data 4 : convergence among grammars 5 : language universals 6 : species - specificity _ ee _ claims the first argument ( speed of acquisition ) is hollow as there is no way of determining what exactly 's peed ' could be in this area . however , it seems uncontroversial enough that children acquire language faster than adults and that they do so without the problems that adults encounter . there is no attempt in the book to address the notion of whether different languages are acquired at different speeds or whether different children acquiring the same language do so in radically different sequences . this would seem to be a distinct possibility if we do not have an innate language specific faculty but rather rely on some generalised learning mechanism . a look at the evidence regarding language acquisition across languages would have helped make the case conclusive . the book should have dealt more with data available in order to show that only a non-nativist account of language acquisition could capture the facts . instead _ ee _ relies on the notion that the popperian account can cope just as well as a nativist account and is closer to the ' common sense ' view of language . but this does not prove that a popperian account is right . chomsky 's second argument ( age - dependence ) is dismissed because , the book states , humans can learn language at any age "" if they see the task as worthwhile "" ( p . 36 ) . however , the author does not describe any procedure for assessing the worthwhileness of the task . why a child would find it worthwhile to learn a language when its needs are being met by compliant adults responding to non-linguistic communication is not addressed . if the early vocalisations of children are evidence of the beginnings of language acquisition , then the child is deciding at a very early age that language is ' worthwhile ' , at a stage when it seems difficult to believe the child is weighing up any options to see what may or may not be worthwhile . following this logic we could extend the criterion of "" worthwhileness "" to other ' learning ' such as ' learning to walk ' and eliminate the innate component from that as well . the book states that there are "" plenty of cases on record of adults mastering a second language to native-speaker standard apart from accent "" ( p . 36 ) ; i am not quite sure what it might mean to achieve native-speaker standard apart from accent . what the book suggests - without providing any crucial evidence - - is that "" learning as a general process is for biological reasons far more rapid before puberty than after "" ( p . 37 ) . this is supposed to show that age dependence is not proof of a critical period for language acquisition using some innate language acquisition device - - a critical period being one of the features that is characteristic of innate behaviour . the age dependence , according to the book , falls out from the slowing down of the learning process in general after puberty . this , however , seems to contradict the other argument against age dependence ; that an adult can master a second language to native speaker standard . the author also states that "" susan curtiss herself regarded genie as refuting the strong version of lenneberg 's claim , that natural language acquisition cannot occur after puberty "" ( p . 37 ) . susan curtiss might want to respond to that one herself . my understanding of her work on genie is that genie did have language ( that is , rule-governed creative linguistic behaviour ) but was not able to achieve anything close to native speaker competence while under observation ( curtiss , p . 204 ) even though it would indeed have been ' worthwhile ' to do so . furthermore her linguistic development did not follow the same course as children acquiring language normally . this suggests that genie 's ability to learn language was diminished due to her age but the important point is that her cognitive development in other areas seemed not to be so affected . it would also have been worthwhile for chelsea to have learned language , yet chelsea did not achieve native speaker standard ( see jackendoff 's _ patterns in the mind _ ) . the third argument presented by chomsky for nativism , according to the book , is poverty of data during acquisition . the arguments against chomsky presented in the book do not bear close scrutiny . according to the book , motherese provides a "" graded series of language lessons "" ( p . 39 ) and is not at all degenerate , as the poverty of data argument states . this is not particularly new ( the references cited by the author are from the early 70s ) . the fact is , however , that we really do not yet know what role - if any - motherese plays in learning / acquiring a language . but one thing worth noting is that there is no language teaching theory that proposes that adults could be most effectively taught a second language through being taught in motherese . it is also true that there do not yet exist conclusive studies on the universality of motherese ( although the wide variety of language groups studied show a high degree of similarity ) . in some cultures motherese seems to play less of a role and is different to the motherese we see in the english speaking world . in fact motherese or child directed speech seems not to make the task of learning / acquiring language all that much easier but what it does is allow for a high degree of socialisation . this can be seen in the fact that the simplification of structure decreased greatly when the parent and child were no longer in the presence of the observer but merely being taped . the motherese wa s not for the benefit of the child only . of course , if language is not in any way innate we are left with the problem of explaining how child directed speech is so perfectly a "" graded series of language lessons "" for the infant , despite the fact that adults are not taught how to give language lessons , perhaps empiricist would have to say that the ability to give "" a graded series of lessons "" in language is innate . the author states that a popperian account of language learning would allow for a child to determine the general principles from the input ( as it would for an adult who wants to learn a language ) . this is important as the nativist account holds that the basic principles of language are innate and thus are available for use in determining what is going on in the language input . individuals learning a language via a popperian method would use their learning abilities to work out the general principles from the input without any of these principles being already available in the head . but what are we to make of cases of * specific language impairment * where the rate of learning / acquisition a language seems different from other areas of learning ? the whole basis of a popperian analysis is that language acquisition is not different from any other domain where learning occurs . consequently , it predicts that there could be no difference between the acquisition of language and learning in other cognitive domains . this prediction runs counter to reported facts as clearly presented in yamada 's 1990 book ' laura : a case study for the modularity of language ' . in arguing against chomsky , the author takes chomsky 's much used example of english speaking children determining how to ask yes / no questions . he is seeking to show that chomsky is being dishonest in his analysis by not verifying the data . a child working out how to make a yes / no question in english has to work out that if any verb is to be moved it has to be the verb in the main clause and not just the first verb encountered in the sentence . to work this out , a child has to distinguish between verbs and other words and also between main verbs and auxiliary verbs as well as knowing the structure of the phrases in the sentence . then the child has to work out that auxiliary verbs in the main clause can move to the beginning of the sentence but that main verbs appear in the infinitive while a tensed 'd o ' occurs at the beginning of the sentence . chomsky 's point is that children learn to make these distinctions and move the appropriate verb from the appropriate position to form a yes / no question with great ease . both the author and chomsky agree on the analysis of the rule involved in forming a yes / no question but where they differ is in their belief about the * exposure * of children to yes / no questions where the main clause is not the first clause in the sentence but rather a subordinate clause appears first , as in : is the man who is talking to bill wearing gloves ? chomsky 's claim is that a child may not encounter such a question in the language s / he hears before determining the rule of yes / no question formation . _ ee _ argues that such sentences are indeed present in the language that children hear . what the book actually has to prove is that all children hear this crucial form of yes / no question before they determine the yes / no question formation rule . this is not shown but instead it is argued that such structures are available to children who read ; but children who do n't read learn language as well . indeed it is quite possible that children form the rule about yes / no question formation before the ever learn to read . the author claims that he shows that chomsky is ' wildly mistaken ' ( p . 42 ) , he paraphrases the situation as follows : "" . . the man who is the world 's leading living intellectual , according the cambridge university a second plato is basing his radical reassessment of human nature largely on the claim that a certain thing never happens ; he tells us that it strains his credulity to think that it might happen , but he has never looked , and people who have looked find that it happens a lot . "" ( p . 42-43 ) the people who have looked are sampson himself and geoff pullum ( p . 42 ) but they have only checked sources of written language but as i have said this ignores the fact that illiterate children can also speak . in fact , so enamoured is the author with the written word that he argues that , historically , hypotaxis emerges as literacy develops . somehow the organisation involved in writing leads to great leaps forward in language . he does finally admit that there is no great research on this topic but blames linguistics departments for this ( "" this is not a popular topic of research in linguistics departments "" , p . 75 ) . there is nothing to prevent the taping of the speakers of modern pre-literate languages - if one can find any cultures that could be classed as pre-literate without any qualifications - in order to test for the occurrence of hypotaxis but the author does n't seem to have u ndertaken this task . the book does n't opt fully for the idea that there was little or no hypotaxis in the languages of ancient pre-literate cultures as the author states , hedging his bets : "" if there was little or no hypotaxis in these languages "" [ the hebrew of the old testament etc . ] "" that is a real difference between them and more recent languages "" . ( p . 75 ) for obvious reasons we can never answer the question of whether or not there was hypotaxis in hebrew before writing or indeed while writing was still a fairly recent innovation . it is true that serious investigation into parataxis and subordination in various languages has been carried out and goes back over one hundred years . the book claims that "" it was a cliche of late nineteenth century linguistics that the early stages of languages with a long recorded history showed a development from what was called parataxis to hypotaxis "" ( p . 74 ) . it cites great linguists like karl brugmann , hermann paul and eduard hermann as support for the notion that languages go from a paratactic stage to a hypotactic stage . but there are two problems with this . firstly , not all nineteenth century linguists would have been happy with the notion that hypotaxis emerged as writing developed . hermann jacobi 's 1897 work ' composition und nebensatz ' concluded that "" maori , like early stages of pie may not have had contained a relative particle "" in subordination ( lehmann , p . 60 ) . so jacobi is claiming that pie did have subordination which is the basis of hypotaxis for brugmann , paul and hermann . secondly , there is really no reason to believe that nineteenth century linguists got everything right in comparative and historical linguistics . the idea that hypotaxis emerged from a previous stage must be seen alongside other ideas in nineteenth century linguistics about the development of languages from primitive systems to more complex systems . the fourth argument the book looks at is convergence among grammars - the notion that people of varying levels of intelligence and exposure to different language inputs , converge on the same grammar . the book claims ( p . 46 ) that chomsky has admitted that educated people may know their mother tongue better . this does not fit in with an i - language approach and so is obviously not representative of chomsky 's theory of language . an i - language approach excludes the possibility of a mother tongue ( an e - language ) that people have mastered to varying degrees . for chomsky such things as english or hungarian or swahili do not exist in any meaningful way . this is controversial , but the point is that for chomsky there is no mother tongue divorced from an individual 's knowledge of it . the second line of argument identified by sampson is that people do not actually converge on the same grammar as they give different grammatical judgments in response to the same data . the book refers to labov 's work - presented in austerlitz ( 1974 ) - where respondents varied in their judgments about the grammaticality of presented sentences . the really interesting thing here is that the people taking the test understood the instructions - oral and written - which they were given concerning the test . it is hard to see how they could all have the same understanding of what was said to them unless they had pretty much the same grammars . the language that was used in their instructions would most likely have contained a variety of syntactic constructions , but there are no reports of the people completing the test remarking on the ungrammaticality of any of the instructions they were given . it is easy to find people varying in groups and even as individuals over time when you ask them to assess sentences such as : ' every one of the boys did n't go there ' . the fact that individuals will differ in their judgment over time shows that what is being tested is not the individual 's competence because an adult 's competence does not vary - although their performance might . a large number of factors determine whether an individual would judge a sentence like the one given above as perfectly grammatical or borderline or totally ungrammatical . but the fact that there is a variation in the reported judgments does not in fact constitute an argument against convergence among grammars it is not a test of grammars but rather a test of performance . intuitions about sentences involving scope relations of quantifiers and negation vary because of the many factors that bear on performance . the book also contends ( pp . 107 - 137 ) that the existence of language universals can be explained by the fact that a popperian learning system will automatically yield such universals . they are not the result of the nature of the language faculty but instead derive from the popperian system of learning . again , the author does not show that a popperian account is better than a nativist account at capturing the facts . if the case against nativism is to be proven , then those language universals that we can agree to exist must be explicable either within a popperian system * only * or at least they should be explained better by a popperian learning theory . the book does not do this . the book targets pinker 's ' the language instinct ' . why sampson decides to devote so much effort to the book is somewhat puzzling . pinker 's book is aimed at a fairly general audience and as such is not really a worthwhile target . among the arguments against pinker we find the assumption that surnames are actual words in individual languages . this means that the existence of a person in england with 's ri ' as the first three letters in his surname means that 's ri ' is a possible initial consonant cluster in english ( p . 83 ) . the author also can't resist taking a pot-shot at what he imagines pinker 's political views to be . the tone of his response to pinker is one of condescension which can be irritating and detracts from any points that the author may be trying to make as well as being irrelevant to the substantive issues . but the worst attack is saved for bickerton . the book seeks to portray him as an intellectual lightweight in a most unappealing way ( p . 76 ) : "" [ bickerton 's ] stuff must be a real hit with green students on hawaii "" . it is surely not too much to expect that personal abuse would be kept out of the realm of intellectual debate . the book also takes on jackendoff stating that jackendoff writes well : "" jackendoff is one of the best writers among the linguistic nativists "" ( p . 76 ) , but not forgiving him for being a nativist . "" if jackendoff reaches for the word ' instinct ' so hastily in these cases , how can we trust him to use the word judiciously where there are real questions to be resolved "" ( p . 79 ) . the main issue picked up on in jackendoff 's work relates to sign language . at one stage the author says ( arguing against jackendoff 's analysis of universal grammar ) : "" jackendoff has shortly beforehand pointed out that one aspect of american sign language grammar is not paralleled in any spoken language . the sign-language equivalent of the third person pronouns ( she , they , his ) consists of gesturing ( with hand shapes and movements that depend on whether the reference is singular , plural or possessive ) to locations in the signing space which have been assigned to successive topics of conversations . ' the effect is that there are as many different third-person pronouns available as there are discernible locations in the signing space ' . no spoken language has a pronoun system remotely like this , so how can it be part of our innate knowledge . "" ( p . 78 ) the author is missing the point here . sign language expresses person , number , gender and possession as spoken language does and not some other features not found in spoken language . so the system the same as spoken language . the use of pronouns in sign language is exactly the same as the use of pronouns in spoken language and is based on universal grammar , what is different is the modality . the availability of the signing space means that a signer can introduce a greater number of pronouns into the discourse as each pronoun can be allocated a location in the signing space without leading to any confusion . this is the same as the fact that i could use as many second person singular pronouns as i wanted as long as i looked at the individual that i was addressing with that pronoun . looking at the person that i was referring to with the pronoun is really the same as the signer using the sign space to tag pronouns . this is not just true of second person pronouns . i could be talking about , say , the members of a football team and refer to each individual using a third person pronoun . i could be quite clear in my own head who is being picked out each time , it would just be confusing to the person i was talking to . this is because there would be no way for them to distinguish the referents of each of the pronouns . in sign language i can exploit the possibility of the signing space by tagging each meaning of a pronoun with a location in space so that the whole thing does not get confusing . the potential in both oral and sign language is the same , but sign can exploit the signing space in a way that oral language cannot . the point is that the limitations are not imposed by language but by the modality . what jackendoff is saying is that the same universal grammar underlies language no matter what the modality . the last chapter in the book ( ' the creative mind ' ) presents sampson 's view of popper . it is not without problems and the author devotes much time to arguing that popper did n't always mean what he said and that sampson 's analysis of popper is the best . however , the crucial lines in the chapter for the purposes of nature vs . nurture are : "" minds are not a topic open to scientific theorising . "" ( p . 139 ) and "" the position adopted in this book is that conscious human minds are not physical entities . talking about minds is not a way of talking about high-level aspects of brain functioning . minds and bodies are different and separate things which act on one another . "" ( p . 138 ) for all those people who believe that minds are indeed a topic open to scientific theorising this will render anything else the book has to say suspect . modern nativists ( as well as most non-nativists ) view the mind as amenable to scientific theorising . for chomsky there is no other possible way to study the mind ( chomsky 1993 , 1995 ) . it is hard to see how a significant debate can take place between two such opposite points of view . the author is committed to the cause of a popperian analysis of language learning / acquisition but will never be able to convert a nativist to his way of thinking until he can gain an understanding of the motivations for adopting a nativist position or reconcile himself with the possibility that nativism may be a stance that an intelligent person can adopt . the author seems to imagine himself fighting a rear guard action against the hordes of misguided nativists who , as he sees it , are close to winning the hearts and minds of the masses . one important aspect of this book is that it can be read as a means of testing how one feels about linguistic nativism . unfortunately for sampson 's crusade , it had the effect of making me prefer the nativist analysis even more than before .

"urgent reply . from the desk of : barr arisman shonikon chambers & associates no 56 b . aba road , port - harcourt nigeria private email address ( @ shymail . com ) dear i sincerely apologize for intruding into your privacy especially by contacting you through this means for a business transaction of this magnitude , but due to its seriousness and urgency it therefore became necessary for me to seek your assistance . i am barr . arisman shonikon , the personal lawyer to late mr . frank ionescu , a foreigner , who worked with an oil servicing company in the oil rich niger delta area of bayelsa state . i am contacting you concerning my late client and an investment he made . i would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail . i contacted you independently and no one should be informed of this communication . i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you . this is a genuine transaction and is 100 % risk free . all i ' m demanding from you is your honest co - operation to enable us achieve our goal , and not a perfidious person . on the 6 th of may , 2002 it was reported to us that my client , his wife and their only daughter were involved in a local plane crash at kano state , enroot abuja ( the capital city ) all occupants in the plane lost their lives , unfortunately on this same flight were other dignitaries like the sports minister and a host of others meanwhile , until his death , my late client had a fixed deposit account of usd $ 15 . million deposited in a security company ( unic security company ) here . recently , i received an ultimatum from the security company asking me to provide my late client ' s relative so that the money would be given to them . but unfortunately it was discovered that my late client did not declare any identifiable family member in all the official documents he tendered to the security company while opening the account . therefore , this development leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit my late client made and who is entitled to be the bona fide beneficiary / next of kin or relative because he died intestate . therefore , if i fail to locate any of his relatives or his next of kin ( and have this money transferred to them ) the security company will at the expiration of the 6 weeks ultimatum given to me confiscate the account . according to the ultimatum issued to me by the security company , if i fail to present to them my late client ' s relative , with a legitimate statement of claim for the money before the given time they will confiscate the account and the money declared ' unclaimed balance ' . this will result in the money being taken over by the security company . this will not happen if i have my way . since i have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives of my late client all these while , my proposal , therefore , is to present you as the next of kin / relative of my client due to the fact that you are a foreigner and can easily pass as a possible relative of my client . i know you will be wondering how possible this could be but i assure you that this is simple . i therefore seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my client so that the money he deposited with the security company would be paid to you and there after you and i will share the money 40 % for you and i will be taking 60 % . i assure you that the deposit would be released to you within a few days because i have all the relevant information that would facilitate that will be required on documentation . first , i will like you to provide immediately the following information : your full names . contact address . telephone / fax numbers . with this information i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavit that will put you in place as the next of kin . after we have successfully satisfied the requirements of the bank the money totaling usd 15 . million would be paid into your account for you to take 40 % and i will be taking 60 % . all i require is your honest co - operation to enable us see this through . there is no risk at all because everything would be done legally and my position as a qualified attorney will facilitate everything . secondly , i will give you all the necessary documents that would serve as evidence proving that you are the next of kin / relative of my late client . these documents will legally conferm on you the status to act as the beneficiary of the estate of my late client . what i related to you might smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand that this is a once in life time opportunity capable of turning around our situation . the truth is that this money would not be taken by the government but by some greedy security company officials and i would not fold my arms and watch this happen hence my decision to contact you . if you are interested in doing this transaction with me kindly send your reply to this email address : ( arismanshonikon @ shymail . com ) thank you as i await your positive response . barr . arisman shonikon .",Phishing Email

August 30, 2002 1:01 pm PTMAX LEVCHIN'S FASCINATION with encryption started when he was a teenager 
in Kiev, Ukraine, and continued as he immigrated to the United States 
where he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 
late 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to 
co-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens 
of millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet 
transaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his 
company for a king's ransom.Not bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine.A programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to 
Chicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a 
mission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure 
passwords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded 
PayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the 
company.""This company was founded on the notion of security value,"" Levchin 
says. ""Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning.""Thiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains 
focused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good 
fortune.""I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction 
processor,"" Levchin says. ""We spend a lot of time designing security so 
it doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. 
The trade-off is fundamental.""Mountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with 
e-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, 
accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The 
service extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and 
more than 3 million business accounts.Most of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led 
PayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. 
Although they were once rivals, the relationship between the two 
companies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition 
of PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review.Levchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. ""There are 
areas of synergy and collaboration we can explore.""Although security is a dominant feature for PayPal, the company's 
ability to carry out open communications among the millions of 
participants fits the growing Web services model, Levchin says.""This is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to 
one another,"" he says. Levchin is a panelist at InfoWorld's 
Next-Generation Web Services II conference Sept. 20PayPal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. And 
Levchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on 
exploiting the system, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst 
covering financial services at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner.""If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was 
susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up,"" 
Litan says.To combat criminals, Levchin established ""Igor,"" an antifraud program 
that monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. Levchin 
says building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. ""The 
work I do is important to PayPal and to consumers in general because the 
work makes Internet shopping safe. It's the view that ecommerce has 
arrived.""

( informally this is being done ) i would have expected the business to utilise a crude ( and possibly necessarily overstated ) scaling factor based on the volatility of credit spread movements in the market and for rac to have signed off this scaling factor . bryan seyfield and david wall will propose this immediately . finally , i believe both commercial and commercial support for credit trading are reprioritising the work being completed for the model for var reporting - we should communicate the new delivery date as soon as possible . i look forward to discussing this and other rac / commercial support interface issues with you next week regards mike from : ted murphy 26 / 06 / 2000 14 : 50 to : sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , bryan seyfried cc : rick buy , richard causey / corp / enron @ enron subject : re : var for credit trading please see the attached comment at the bottom of this string of e - mails . the privilege of using enron ' s balance sheet comes with the responsibility to adequately report the risk in the form that has been agreed to . it is appalling to me that we are currently incapable of calculating var in a product that has been approved for trading for several months . it is equally appalling that the support staff continues to be so unaware of the importance of this that the comments below could even be considered reasonable . obviously , the individual who made the comment is hardly responsible . it lies with both commercial and commercial support management . i know that airing this out in such a broad way appears to be harsh . this is not the point . this is not an isolated problem . it is not just pertaining to europe . please do not feel singled out . but the scrutiny and pressure on var as a measure of risk continues to grow at fast pace . we can hardly make any progress if this is the pervasive attitude . let ' s knock this stuff out one at a time . ted oliver gaylard 06 / 26 / 2000 08 : 34 am to : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron cc : chris abel / hou / ect @ ect , michael e moscoso / hou / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : var for credit trading the var engine for credit trading is being built by research in london and it is intended that var be run daily as soon as they have produced / signed off on this . oliver from : david port @ enron 26 / 06 / 2000 14 : 24 to : chris abel / hou / ect @ ect cc : michael e moscoso / hou / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : var for credit trading my view : prove its insignificant by calculating it every day , that ' s why the board approved the limit . dp chris abel @ ect 06 / 23 / 2000 07 : 41 am to : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron cc : michael e moscoso / hou / ect @ ect subject : var for credit trading fyi - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by chris abel / hou / ect on 06 / 23 / 2000 07 : 38 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mary thambiah 06 / 23 / 2000 03 : 29 am to : chris abel / hou / ect @ ect cc : david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect subject : var for credit trading hi chris i talked with david yesterday and we don ' t think the risk is significant enough to start calculating a var number . however if you have any queries feel free to give him a call . rgds mary",Safe Email

If u choose Setup NT from the installation CD it will reboot your system

I did this the other night, with the check MBR option, but it didn't

Hi,I've installed Quake 3 onto my computer and it starts to run up ok but as
soon as the graphics start it bails out.  It complains that there is an
error in sis_drv.o,  the line before this says that it is starting Quake in
24 bit depth, now from http://www.winischhofer.net/linuxsis630.shtml I
understand that the sis630 won't do 24 bit depth.  So is there a way to make
Quake start up in 16 bit depth?  I've done some ""google""ing but drawn a
blank.....ThanksGreg

    Message-ID:  <1030028647.6462.TMDA@deepeddy.vircio.com>  | hmmm, I assume you're going to report this to the nmh folks?It turns out, when I did some investigation, that my memory of how MH
worked here was wrong (that's not unusual) - the -seq switch seems to
have always done -nolist (requiring a subsequent -list to turn it on
again).Given that, I have no idea how the pick code as it was ever worked.  In
fact, it quite possibly never did the way it was intended to (I have just
been browsing the 2.5 sources, and that seems to be attempting to do things
that I never saw happen).It may be that your new sequence method just exposed the bug that had been
there all along.Given this, I won't be sending any bug reports to the nmh people.  If nmh
ever seems to be showing any signs further progress, and if I remember this
then, I might send them a change request.   The code to make the change is
trivial.kre_______________________________________________

"It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** Anyone can do it.** It only takes a few hours to learn.When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.
*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.
*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 
*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.
*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 
*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 
*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.
*** Make money on the biggest news stories.
*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 
*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.
*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 
It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from

His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE

"FYI, members of this list might be interested in the 4th International
Workshop on Web Site Evolution (WSE 2002), being held October 2, 2002, in
Montreal, Canada.http://star.itc.it/wse2002/- Jim>>From the Web page: The potential of the Web as a vehicle for offering a variety of services is
becoming more apparent as Web sites evolve their contents from static
information to more dynamic and interactive forms. A number of new standards
and commercial products are emerging, offering a basis for developing
Web-based services from dynamic composible resources, extending both the
range and scope of services that can be made available through the Web.The goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together members of the Web
design, software engineering, and information technology communities to
discuss techniques for migrating to Web services. Architectural styles and
tool support for service-based Web sites are currently quite diverse.
Expertise in constructing service-based Web pages is quite limited, and
experience accounts are lacking. The explosion of non-traditional computing
platforms for browsing the Web, such as PDAs, WAP-enabled phones, and
Internet appliances, is forcing Web professionals to rethink the separation
of form from content and the range and scope of services offered via the
Web.WSE 2002 will provide an opportunity for the exchange of information related
to exciting new research and empirical results in areas including (but not
limited to):*   Migrating to Web services
*   Web quality determination and improvement through process and product
control
*   Enhancing Web sites to make them more accessible, reliable, and usable
*   Analyzing and reverse-engineering Web site content and structure
*   Making Web site content available in multiple formats for multiple
platforms
*   Applying traditional software engineering activities such as
architecture, metrics, and testing to Web sites
*   Case studies of large-scale Web site reuse, reengineering, and evolutionWSE 2002 is co-located with the IEEE International Conference on Software
Maintenance (ICSM 2002). ICSM is the IEEE Computer Society's flagship event
focused on the modernization of existing systems. ICSM 2002's theme of
""maintaining distributed heterogeneous systems"" nicely compliments WSE
2002's overall theme and goals.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

The way to debug something like this is to turn on the log (Preferences 
-> Hacking Support -> Debug log enabled) and track the gpg commands 
being issued and the responses.FWIW, using exmh 2.5 and gpg 1.0.7 I do not have problems sending 
encrypted messages to myself. When I select the message, an xterm 
window pops up asking for the passphrase. I don't recall exmh ever 
asking me for the passphrase from the tty that started exmh nor from a 
dialog box. (But then again, I'm not a heavy gpg user).KevinIn message <200209111917.PAA02912@blackcomb.panasas.com>, Brent Welch writes:

Next major release is scheduled to contain: - Core: hard coded root public key, for authenticating top level NameSpaces - Signing Services: Implementation of web based signing services End user hosted signing service - Example User Authentication Application - Example Payment System based on NeuDistI will be expanding the documentation over the next few weeks. This will cover not only more indepth technical documentation, but also higher level documentation about the business side of things.Read more about NeuDist or download our early version at http://neudist.org I would love to hear your questions and suggestions.

"Well, for one, it would free up the similar laptop I already got to
just run Amithlon (or if that wasn't so fun, bsd) to run just OpenBSD!This is a near-term thing I could look forward to!However, an 'official' laptop seems unexciting to me with only
the items mentioned.  Most important are the particulars distinguishing
the listed spec from a Dell 2650, preferably:
1- GeForce4 440 Go or newer, pleasingly modern GPU; the
   GeForce2Go (with 16MB video RAM; too little) I have is
   not so much too slow as inefficient; with factory settings it would
   actually crash from running too hot and too fast.
   (Accelerating the Ami* and possibly OpenUAE graphics
   is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments,
   but an energy-efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and
    portability (read: battery lifetime) enabler.)1.5- Great control over CPU state; by use of 'internet keys'
    wired to BIOS/bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll
    wheel.  Also, hibernate that works, please.1.7- Bootable to USB 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones)
    in BIOS, please.2- P4 Dells overheat.  They have a big heatsink and a little fan
   to pull air through it, and if you don't elevate thelaptop off
   the desk or table or bed it's on, the fan will -stay- on.  Not good
  for MTBS (mean time between service; unless you've got an
  angle on making money on service from Amigans.....)
     One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs
  behind the AMLCD, thus using the backside of the display
  half as a radiator.; though it interferes with the case notion
  below.  (yes, Aavid or such makes some as a standard part.)
      I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative
  mass in elevating the laptop (i.e. in the form of a catch-handle
  and second logo device behind the laptop, which generally
  provides stow and attachment for elevation legs (move them
  out farther to get to the next-higher ekevation, until the sides
  of the laptop are met.)  This also happens to provide a little
  protection for USB 2  and 1394 cables that I tend to keep
  plugged in all the time (a bit longer port life? Please.) 3- A case color other than brown or black, and preferably (if the
    display module NRE is entirely permissive) the capability to
    -run with the backlight off.-  Again, to save battery power, but
    also as a feature; maybe you remember the iBooks modified
   in this manner.  The user has the privilege to pull out the
   backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe/CF assembly, with
   its backreflector, and the whole warrantee.  This provides
   for excellent outdoor use, often with the diffuser reinserted
   to keep depth-of-field distractions minimised.
     What would I like?  A1200 putty color, any translucency,
   in or over a rosewood-colored (in KDE color browser, I see
   chocolate, firebrick and a couple of 'indian red' that are great
   candidates) base.  
      I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight
    without closing the lid, and to be -able- to fit an -external-
    light source such as a UV-filtered solar collector (and glare
    hood) to feed
    into the backlight.  Not only does this make an excellent 
    color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably.
      The logo should be a coloration of a
   minimal surface, as the MAA is trying to get me to renew
   with:  demos at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/geometry/
   at first blush.  We'll see what comes out of the contest and
   maybe you'll like the mapping MathCAD does of the
   logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the
   openness of AmigaOS, Ami* and Amiga community.
   MAA.org has more references, I'm sure.4- Obviously Elfin details., e,g, the backlight inlet.Other details:
USB2.x preferred; FireWire would be needed if that's unavailable.
Options like 802.11b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port
should round out the offering.  An option for just-released 
.13 micron P4 (with mobile power features) could make more
reviewers greenlight the series; much better power consumption,
and almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that.
CompactFlash, SmartMedia and MMC flash memory card
interfaces would be very pleasant.  I've mentioned booting to
USB, and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also.
To that end, a backup solution with compression using
USB 2 storage or the multimode drive is always a nice 
bundle item; that or a chance to back out a patch under 3 OS.....
Blue skies (and clear water and fresh air): 
Waterproof to 30 feet, 3 Ethernet ports plus onboard WiFi.
Svelte; 3-line frontpanel LCD and bright red pager LED,
builtin G4 cellphone functions, choice of side and 
frontpanel trim: Ivory-like stuff inscribed with M68k memory map
and various OS 3.9 structures or textured fur that
says 'This is Amiga Speaking' when stroked 'round. 
Decent keyboard, as in Toshiba or IBM laptops; perhaps 
an ergonomic fingerworks.com device (they work as 
keyboard and mouse) as the keyboard/trackpad.
2 Directional planar mics atop AMLCD; soundcard with multiple 
18 bit A-D and noise reduction DSP that work in our
(second-through-fourth, at least) favorite OS.
Actual 7"" bellows pulls out at nominal ventilation 
fan location for real void-comp (the test in Blade
Runner) style cooling and extended bass; active cooling
and airfiltering is available to adjust humidity at user
seat and provide mineral water.
HyperTransport ports.

I'm skeptical.  One of the many perversions of modern civilization is the fictitious
rendering of various peoples, frequently to the point where the fiction
is more ""real"" than the reality.  You see it over and over again in
history:  The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The Junior
Anthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only became
Junior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before you
know it the charade takes on a life of its own which the Primitive
People are compelled to perpetuate.  Worse, even when there is
substantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, the
facts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fiction
that is already firmly entrenched.  And many peoples (e.g. American
Indians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth
in popular culture.I'm far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter where
you are on the planet.  The only time you see any anomalies is when you
have a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal
population, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population.-James Rogers

Date: 2002-10-02T09:42:39-05:00I think I'm going to become one of _those_ people. You know, one of those 
people who has a â€œSemantic Webâ€ category on their weblog. This will 
be a Geek Purity Test question someday. Onward: - _Phil Ringnalda_: Fun with RDF[1]. â€œRDF can actually be fun, as long as 
you don't foolishly invest too much ego in trying to store RSS 1.0, or wander 
off into flame wars.â€ From which we find: 
- _Shelley Powers_: The RDF Query-O-Matic[2], and The RDF Query-O-Matic 
explained[3]. â€œThe Query-o-Matic accepts the name of an RDF file (any 
valid RDF file), and an RDFQL (RDF Query Language) query, and will print out a 
test value found as a result of that query.â€ 
- _Marcus Campbell_: â€œMy FOAF autocreation script is moving along nicely
[4]. It's now looping through my OPML blogroll file, checking the first load of 
bites in people's pages for head linked FOAF files, grabbing certain elements 
from these files (if they have one) and spitting them out into a brand new FOAF 
file for me.â€ 
- _Joe Gregorio_: The Well-Formed Web[5]. â€œAfter spending some time 
badgering poor Bill Kearney for a concrete benefit of having RDF in RSS 1.0 and 
not getting a really satisfactory answer I went back and read Paul Ford's essay 
again. I wanted to get that old religious feeling back again. It didn't work. 
The magic was gone.â€ [1] http://philringnalda.com/archives/002336.php

"cfp : workshop on spoken language generation and multimodal information systems 2nd ` speak ! ' workshop : speech generation in multimodal information systems and practical applications 2nd - 3rd november 1995 gmd / ipsi , darmstadt , germany * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * call for contributions * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * this workshop aims to bring together researchers , developers , and potential producers and marketers of multimodal information systems in order to consider the role of * spoken language synthesis * in such systems . not only do we need to be able to produce spoken language appropriately - - - including effective control of intonation - - - but also we need to know in which practical contexts spoken language is most beneficial . this requires a dialogue between those providing spoken natural language technology and those considering the practical use of multimodal information systems . the workshop will consist of paper presentations and practical demonstrations , as well as a roundtable discussion on the best strategies for pursuing the practical application of spoken language synthesis technology in information systems . suggested topic areas / themes include , but are not limited to : * functional control of intonation in synthesized speech * use of speech in intelligent interfaces for information systems * integration of speech into automatic query systems * cooperative integration of speech with text generation for information systems * evaluation strategies for information systems involving speech synthesis * applications for information systems with spoken language output capabilities * practical requirements for information systems with spoken language capabilities . potential participants are invited to submit short statements of interest indicating whether they would be interested in presenting a paper , offering a system demonstration , participating in the round table discussion , or simply attending . statements of interest and extended abstracts ( max . 7 pages ) should be sent by 1st . october by e-mail to : ` bateman @ gmd . de ' or by post to : john a . bateman , gmd / ipsi , dolivostr . 15 , d-64293 darmstadt , germany . extended abstracts will be made available at the workshop . during the workshop current results and demonstrations of the eu copernicus program project ` speak ! ' will also be given ( see attachment ) . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - project information : the speak ! project : speech generation in multimodal information systems "" speak ! "" is a european union funded project ( copernicus ' 93 project no . 10393 ) whose aim is to embed spoken natural language synthesis technology with sophisticated user interfaces in order to improve access to information systems . multimedia technology and knowledge-based text processing enhance the development of new types of information systems which not only offer references or full-text documents to the user but also provide access to images , graphics , audio and video documents . this diversification of the in formation offered has to be supported by easy-to - use multimodal user interfaces , which are capable of presenting each type of information item in a way that it can be perceived and processed effectively by the user . users can easily process simultaneously the graphical medium of information presentation and the linguistic medium . the separation of mode is also quite appropriate for the different functionalities of the main graphical interaction and the supportive meta-dialogue carried out linguistically . we believe , therefore , that a substantial improvement in both functionality and user acceptance is to be achieved by the integration of spoken languages capabilities . however , text-to - speech devices commercially available today produce speech that sounds unnatural and that is hard to listen to . high quality synthesized speech that sounds acceptable to humans demands appropriate intonation patterns . the effective control of intonation requires synthesizing from meanings , rather than word sequences , and requires understanding of the functions of intonation . in the domain of sophisticated human-machine interfaces , we can make use of the increasing tendency to design such interfaces as independent agents that themselves engage in an interactive dialogue ( both graphical and linguistic ) with their users . such agents need to maintain models of their discourses , their users , and their communicative goals . the speak ! project , which was launched recently as a cooperation between the speech research technology laboratory of the technical university of budapest and the technical university of darmstadt ( in cooperation with gmd-ipsi ) , aims at developing such an interface for a multimedia retrieval system . at ipsi , the departments komet ( natural language generation ) and mind ( information retrieval dialogues ) contribute to this project . the project is to construct a proof-of - concept prototype of a multimodal information system combining graphical and spoken language output in a variety of languages . the work involves four supporting goals : first , to advance the state of the art in the domains of speech synthesis , spoken text generation , and graphical interface design ; second , to provide enabling technology for higher functionality information systems that are more appropriate for general public use ; third , to significantly improve the public and industrial acceptance of speech synthesis in general and the hungarian text-to - speech technology elaborated within the project in particular ; and , fourth , to act as a focusing point for speech work in hungary . contact points : gmd / ipsi , darmstadt : john bateman e-mail : bateman @ gmd . de fax : + 49 / 6151-869 - 818 tel : + 49 / 6151-869 - 826 tu - budapest : g ' eza n ' emeth e-mail : nemeth @ ttt - 202 . ttt . bme . hu fax : + 36 / 1-463 - 3107 tel : + 36 / 1-463 2401",Safe Email

#first param is number of
#times to repeat second param

#e.g. quote=`repeat 3 '> '`
repeat() {
     seq -s , $1 | sed ""sÂ¬[0-9]\{1,\}[,]*Â¬$2Â¬g""

"partnership request request for urgent business relationship dear sir , firstly , i must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction . this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and  top secret .  though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried , but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day . we have decided to contact you first by your email due to the urgency of this transaction , as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you . so we decided it is best using the email . let me start by first introducing myself properly to you . i am dr . osaro ame , a director general in the ministry of mines and power and i head a three - man tender board appointed by the government of the federal republic of nigeria to award contracts to individuals and companies and to approve such contract payments in the ministry of mines and power . the duties of the committee also include evaluation , vetting and monitoring of work done by both foreign and local contractors in the ministry . i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence . in order to commence this business , we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds . the source of this funds is as follows : between 1996 and 1997 , this committee awarded contracts to various contractors for engineering , procurement , supply of electrical equipments such as transformers , and some rural electrification projects . however , these contracts were over - invoiced by the committee , thereby , leaving the sum of us $ 11 . 5 million dollars ( eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars ) in excess . this was done with the intention that the committee will share the excess when the payments are approved . the federal government have since approved the total contract sum which has been paid out to the companies and contractors concerned which executed the contracts , leaving the balance of $ 11 . 5 m dollars , which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe off - shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst ourselves . we need your assistance as the funds are presently secured in an escrow account of the federal government specifically set aside for the settlement of outstanding payments to foreign contractors . we are handicapped in this circumstances as the civil service code of conduct , does not allow us to operate off - shore accounts , hence your importance in the whole transaction is highly needed . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf , you or your company will retain 20 % of the total amount of us $ 11 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars ) , while 70 % will be for us ( members of this panel ) and the remaining 10 % will be used in offsetting all debts / expenses incurred ( both local and foreign ) in the cause of this transfer . needless to say , the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in return we demand your complete honesty and trust . it does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of this nature described here , the assumption is that your company won the major contract and sub - contracted it out to other companies . more often than not , big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution of such contracts . we are civil servants and we will not want to miss this once in a life time opportunity . you must however , note that this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below , as we have heard confirmed cases of business associates running away with funds kept in their custody when it finally arrive their accounts . we have decided that this transaction will be based completely on the following : ( a ) . our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence . ( b ) . that you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality . ( c ) . that upon receipt of the funds , you will promptly release our share ( 70 % ) on demand after you have removed your 20 % and all expenses have been settled . ( d ) . you must be ready to produce us with enough information about yourself to put our minds at rest . please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and risk free and we hope to conclude the business in ten bank working days from the date of receipt of the necessary information and requirement from you . endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my email fax number 1 - 443 - 658 - 2542 or my email address and i will bring you into the complete picture of this transaction when i have heard from you . your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we are already behind schedule for this financial quarter . thank you and god bless . yours faithfully , dr . osaro ame do you yahoo ! ? yahoo ! health - your guide to health and wellness http : / / health . yahoo . com",Phishing Email

This thread is starting to rapidly decay ...these are old bits which I cannot explain exactly why I thought they
were important now or why I went rummaging through back folders to
find them or even why I felt compelled by a deep sense of inner
purpose to post them here ...http://www.weeklyworldnews.com/stories/2238.html20 NEW SIGNS THAT YOU WERE ABDUCTED BY SPACE ALIENS!WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- You may have been abducted by space aliens --
and not even know it!Psychiatrists, psychologists and UFO experts say millions of people
all over the world have been kidnapped by extraterrestrials. But most
of them can't recall the experience because the memory is so painful
that they've buried it deep in their subconscious minds.But there are strong tip-offs that you may be one of the millions who
have encountered beings from another planet, if you know what to watch
for.Experts at Wake Forest University here, as well as other respected
institutions around the world, offer 20 startling new indicators that
you may have had a close encounter:1. You experience unexplained nausea or a strange sense of uneasiness
around the same time each day.2. You have an unusual new scar or strange mark on your body --
particularly on the roof of your mouth or behind an ear.3. You often find yourself hungry for oranges or lemons -- even after
you've had a large meal or eaten enough food to fill your
stomach. Researchers at Oslo University say this hunger for citrus is
common in alien abductees.4. You have a strong, ever-present feeling that there is some mission
or important thing you're supposed to do in life and you find yourself
constantly driven to achieve it or discover what it might be.5. You often find yourself going through your trash, or the trash of
others, without knowing exactly what you're looking for. Swiss UFO
researchers found that people who have been abducted often find
themselves unaccountably digging through refuse.6. You frequently dream of cattle. Psychologists at the University of
Paris say it's common for the subconscious mind to substitute a cow or
bull for an alien being.7. You feel you're ""special"" or ""chosen.""8. You are a vegetarian -- but can't exactly explain why.9. You have an overpowering feeling of dread when you see photos or
drawings of space aliens.10. You are prone to addictive or compulsive behavior. This in itself
is not necessarily indicative of alien abduction. But if there are
other indicators as well, you could be an abductee.11. You wet the bed. Studies in Peru show there's a connection.12. You have frequent insomnia.13. You are strangely intrigued by old western movies. Psychologists
say they can't yet explain abductees' fascination with cowboy movies,
but they say it exists in at least 75 percent of victims.14. Electronic devices often go haywire around you for no discernible
reason.15. You have seen -- or think you've seen -- a mysterious, hooded
figure in or near your home more than once.16. Your fingers are stiff, numb or unresponsive for more than an hour
after you wake up.17. You have had -- or currently have -- severe back or neck problems.18. You frequently experience a ringing in one ear.19. You often get sinusitis or other nasal pain.20. You are frequently haunted by the sense that you're being watched.--

"disc . sex / lang a few remarks in the discussion , and comments on / to newman , meunier the widespread "" constructivist "" concept of personality and sex roles / language is seriously injured by what jane goodall has to say below . is my interpretation wrong that the preoccupation in feminist studies with sex roles / language , and the diffusion of that preoccupation into other corridors of the university , began as an assault on "" normativity "" , i . e . , knee-jerk heteropartnershipping in the late 1960s ? we are attracted to the opposite sex only because society teaches this to us . thumbs up to tolerance , real diversity , and curing the real ills of society by needs of the individual not the group ; thumbs down to intuitive scholarship , academic shamanism , and prescriptive grammas jane goodall , through a window , houghton mifflin company , boston , 1990 . "" my thirty years with the chimpanzees of gombe . "" ( p 118 ) one of the most important milestones in the life of a young male is when he begins to travel away from his mother with other members of the community . the severing of apron strings is far more necessary for a young male than a young female . she can learn most of what she needs to know for a successful adult life whilst remaining in her family setting . not only can she watch her mother and her mother 's friends caring for their infants , but she can actually handle them herself , gaining much of the experience which she will need later when she has a baby of her own . and she can learn , during her mother 's ` pink days ' , a good deal about sex and the demands that will subsequently be made of her in that sphere . the young male has different things to learn . there are some aspects of community life that are primarily , though not entirely , male responsibilities = adsuch as patrolling , repelling intruders , searching out distant food sources , and some kinds of hunting . he cannot gain adequate experience in such matters if he remains with his mother . he must leave her and spend time with the males . = = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d michael newman provides some welcome references in the literature that provide data more specific for what we all know generally , that some terms are semantically marked for gender - - marine , lumberjack , nurse . regarding "" he "" - - it has biases for masculine interpretation - - no doubt about that for the current state of the language . in centuries before modern english , and into the modern english era , "" he "" was also a feminine pronoun . michael newman is "" skeptical of pernicious influences of grammar on ot her aspects of cognition "" , whereas lydie meunier says "" "" studies in psychology have shown that females reading texts written in a generic-he retain less information than when they read texts using a generic plural "" . newman goes on to express accord with moulton 's "" kleenex effect whereby the identity of a prestigious subset is assumed by the superordinated category , with the result that people tend to think of the subset as more prototypical "" . this sounds like individual-for - the-class synechdoche . i do not think that the "" prestigious subset "" sufficiently describes he / man phenomena , does not hit the mark head on , because it assumes man is to woman under "" man "" , as kleenex is to puffs under "" kleenex "" . i think my use of the term "" tautonym "" focuses a little sharper on the genus-species aspect . the difference between coke and pepsi is more like the difference between joe and john , and of a different order than that between boys and girls . i am suggesting another way to see the generic phenomenon - - in part supported by what i quoted in detail from jakobson a few posts back : a man is a living generic person , only made distinctive for sex in contrast / juxtapostion with woman . generic he / man in language describes generic he / man in-the - flesh - - as unmarked for sex . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - to lydie meunier : i am glad to know that someone on linguistic has expertise in sociolinguistic practices during biblical times . could you provide some chapters and verses about the more-or - less slavery of wives to their husbands ? it 's true there are all kinds of depravities in the bible , in f = act joshua was quite an ethnic cleanser himself . do you know if there is anything in the bible about how wives of slaves were treated , as they wou = ld be "" double-slaves "" ? finally , you use the word "" sexism "" , so popular in our = common cultural vocabulary , but , aside from it being a political slogan , = how could we most appropriately define it in its non-political slogan sense , = as you use it ? = jeff weber =",Safe Email

( "" gccc "" ) to assist in finding acquisition candidates for the company , structuring such acquisitions , and effecting a transition to corporate growth . at present , vinoble and gccc have targeted several companies as potential acquisition candidates . pending the outcome of due diligence and audits , the company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis required for listing on a national exchange . here is recent news on the company : malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - may 2 o , 20 o 5 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb : vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services , is pleased to announce that as it continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition of assets , businesses , and strategic partners in the rfid and gps tracking sector , vinoble has further engaged with several additional businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology , software , and patents . following the move to acquire rfid ( radio frequency identification ) technology , hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use applications , the company has concluded that the need for application support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the framework which operates such technology . the company has identified several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software , and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element . middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications , both internally and externally , to the enterprise . this typically involves routing data using different transport protocols , translating data into different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as web services and service - oriented architectures . since rfid is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and non - mobile assets , user - friendly and efficient management software enabling customers to manage rfid data both incoming and out - bound is important in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with customer service . management software will allow for real time visibility of assets or product inventory , whether in transit , in a warehouse , at the manufacturing plant , or on a store shelf . visibility and accuracy will enable customers to reduce handling costs , gain instant access to shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply chain . the ability to manage data collection from a number of different rfid and gps devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system . the company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology will be essential and will further position vinoble in the vastly growing rfid and gps tracking industry . the company ' s goal is to provide critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of their personnel and assets in this current state of constant threat . safe harbor statement : this press release contains forward - looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 ( the "" act "" ) . in particular , when used in the preceding discussion , the words "" plan , "" "" confident that , "" "" believe , "" "" scheduled , "" "" expect , "" or "" intend to , "" and similar conditional expressions are intended to identify forward - looking statements within the meaning of the act and are subject to the safe harbor created by the act . such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties , and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward - looking statement . such risks and uncertainties include , but are not limited to , the ability of vinoble to complete the proposed acquisition ( s ) , the results of vinoble ' s due diligence review of the candidate ( s ) , the success of the business of the acquisition candidate ( s ) , including the ability of vinoble to continue to sell the applicable products and the acceptance of those newly designed products by the market , market conditions , the general acceptance of the company ' s products and technologies , competitive factors , timing , and other risks described in the company ' s sec reports and filings . the closing of the transaction will be subject to complete due diligence , inspections , and completion of audited financial statements in accordance to gaap as required by the sec prior to consummation . we believe the speculative near term target price is - $ o . 50 we believe the speculative long term target price - $ 4 . 00 we feel this is our best pick since december of 2004 ! ! please watch this one trade tuesday ! disclaimer : information within this email contains "" forward looking statements "" within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 . any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions , expectations , beliefs , plans , projections , objectives , goals , assumptions or future events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be "" forward looking statements .

( otc - bb : dcpi ) dcpi has developed a revolutionary digital printing technology recognized to be the solution to variable graphical / color printing processes by industry leaders such as ibm ( nyse : ibm ) ; xerox ( nyse : xrx ) and siemens ( nyse : si ) whose products only print in black via laser products . dcpi ' s commercial printing application hardware / software and printing consumable products are expected to dominate the printing enhancement market ( $ 5 billion plus + + in 2002 ) over the next several years . dcpi ' s initial target market of more than 4 , 000 large scale commercial printing companies of the total of 46 , 000 establishments is expected to drive revenue growth to the tens of millions within its first few years , further providing an ongoing revenue stream from the sales of printing consumable products for years to come . special investment alert digital color print , inc . ( otc bulletin board : dcpi ) current price : $ 1 . 25 shares outstanding : 24 . 6 million market capitalization : $ 31 million short term target : $ 3 . 00 12 month target : $ 9 . 00 a few reasons to own dcpi : digital color print , inc . ( dcpi ) , through it ' s wholly owned subsidiary logical imaging solutions ( lis ) , is in the business of supplying high - speed digital printing systems and supplies to the commercial printing industry . the printing systems are unique in technical concept and application . the systems are totally digital , designed to mount on existing offset web presses and significantly improve the functionality of the press , not as a replacement - but as an enhancement . the printing process is called electron beam imaging ( ebi ) , and is significantly faster the convention laser printing - the only partially competing technology . printing is america ' s third largest manufacturing industry ; employing more than 1 . 2 million people in almost 46 , 000 establishments . the printing industry , during 2002 , produced over $ 165 billion of printed products and purchased $ 4 . 5 billion of hardware and $ 7 . 7 billion of consumable products . nyse - listed dover corporation , the largest manufacturer of offset web presses , estimates that there are more than 35 , 000 presses installed in the u . s . , with a press costing from $ 150 , 000 to several million and using as much as $ 10 , 000 of consumable products per month . offset presses print all types of documents ; forms , labels , tickets , tags , advertisements and direct mail pieces , at production rates of 500 pages - per - minute ( ppm ) to thousands of ppm . however , the printed materials produced are each identical , as each image printed is the offset inked image derived from the printing plates that are mounted on the offset press . the great limitations of the offset process are that each image ( page ) remains identical unless the printing plates are changed . also the inking of the plates requires the laborious tasks of mixing the inks for each plate , inking the plates and then cleaning the press for the next job . if the print job requires variable information , such as ; name , address , bar codes , dates , prices , this must be added in a distinctly separate print operation . typically this task is performed by expensive data processing laser printers , manufactured by either xerox , ibm or oce ' ( formerly , siemens printing systems ) . the laser printers print only in black . lis printing systems are designed to mount directly on most offset web presses and allow for the printing of any type of data or graphics , without limitation , and in line with the offset presses traditional production of a colorful end product . as a simple example : in the production of an event ticket such as a superbowl ticket , all fixed or non - variable information , such as the colorful photo - quality front cover and the stadium rules and disclaimers on the reverse side of the ticket are produced by plates on an offset press ; identical information on each ticket . a second printing process is then required to add the variable information , which includes the section , seat and row numbers , price and date of the event . this function can be accomplished , in line , by an lis provided system . lis printing systems are entirely digital and are dry toner based , which precludes the laborious press set - up and clean - up tasks , ink mixing and storage and the production of printing plates . the pressman simply runs the paper directly through lis ' s printer and it becomes an integral part of the press and the starting and stopping of the press and the placement of the digital object on the page are all under the control of lis proprietary software . nyse - listed dover corporation , the largest manufacturer of offset web presses , estimates that there are more than 35 , 000 presses installed in the u . s . , with a press costing from $ 150 , 000 to several million and using as much as $ 10 , 000 of consumable products per month . dcpi ' s digitalcolorpress was designed to be installed on the majority of these presses , extending their life and utility by providing the printing of computer generated variable data in - line with the offset printing function . further , the system eliminates the need for preparing and storing printing plates , and inks and the expensive tasks of setting up a press for a print run , followed by tearing down after each job , cleaning the press and setting up for the next print job . dcpi estimates that the majority of printers will upgrade to color during the first two years of the digitalcolorpress availability and thousands more commercial printers will purchase systems through dcpi ' s direct sales force and distribution channel during the next two years . dcpi ' s first growth step is to increase consumable inventory to support existing lis systems , each installation generates about $ 6 , 000 per month in consumable purchases . secondly , to make lis ' s unique color press available from inventory and expand the current number of installed sites . thirdly , make the product offering available to the commercial printing industry . large tasks , but currently without any perceived competition or technological limitation . this stock will see major upward movement in the next several weeks . right now , dcpi is one of the street ' s best kept secrets , but it will not remain that way for long . this is a unique opportunity to get in while trading levels are still low . as the company goes forward with its business plan and signs major new contracts , this stock will move quickly . this is your last chance to invest before dcpi begins major price appreciation . this stock could reach $ 3 . 50 in the next five trading days ! the writers , pr firm , mailers involved in the creation , and distribution of the information above are not a registered broker / dealer and may not sell , offer to sell or offer to buy any security . this profile is not a solicitation or recommendation to buy , sell securities . an offer to buy or sell can be made only with accompanying disclosure documents from the company offering or selling securities and only in the states and provinces for which they are approved . the material in this release is intended to be strictly informational and based on assumptions rather than fact . the companies that are discussed in this release have not approved the statements made in this release nor approved the timing of this release . all statements and expressions are the sole opinion of the creators and are subject to change without notice . information in this release is derived from a variety of sources including that company ' s publicly disseminated information , third parties and the writers research and optimistic speculation . the accuracy or completeness of the information is not warranted and is only as reliable as the sources from which it was obtained . all involved in the creation and distribution of this profile / release disclaims any and all liability as to the completeness or accuracy of the information contained and any omissions of material fact in this release . the release may contain technical and factual inaccuracies or typographical errors . it is strongly recommended that any purchase or sale decision be discussed with a financial adviser , or a broker -

"disc . sex / lang i have been proceeding with a "" disc he / she "" theme . it has been somewhat expanded , and i would like to have it posted under the "" disc : sex / lang "" subject head . thanks , jw ] in the continuing discussion of pronouns , i ' m making a summary and a shift . the shift is spurred by the necessity to widen the orbit from pronouns to "" sex and language "" , perhaps an inevitable transition . alexis manaster ramer ( see below ) has suggested that a discussion of universal male dominace in society / language should take place prior to one of pronouns . i willingly go along , but reject the misandrist characterization . first the pronoun summary . "" he "" summary in my "" he "" work , i have suggested that to understand the generic and proverbial uses of modern english "" he "" , one would have to integrate into their data the facts that 1 ) "" he "" as a feminine pronoun survived much later in historical english than is generally acknowledged , and that 2 ) the late-archaic english "" he "" , on the one hand , as feminine , had an association with the all-genders plural , and on the other , as a masculine , had an association with the singular and neuter . "" him "" and "" his "" were during middle english , and later , also neuter ( "" not one or the other "" ) pronouns , and the ontogeny of the modern paradigm must account for these facts . there are more than a few examples of "" he "" in a generic / proverbial context in which , if there is any sex distinction at all , it must be considered feminine , not masculine , as in the following ( _ piers plowman _ , walter kane - - passus vii , manuscript h3 , lines 235-36 ) : he that etyn here fode throw trauail god 3eueth they / she that eat / eats their / her food through work god gives hem his blissing that here liflode so wynneth them his blessing that their / her livelihood so earns . _ _ _ when the 18th century grammarians put the "" he "" rule on paper , the feminine morphology was not unknown , not yet forgotten . if gender feminists today put a gendrist interpretation on the grammarians ' motives and on the evolution of the "" he "" rule , it is through historical oversight , to put it kindly , and not for , as some maintain , misogynist motives , conscious or unconscious . finally , i have challenged the interpretation of the "" worthiness "" doctrine . according to it , the grammarians of yore said "" he "" was more "" worthy "" . the word "" worthy "" has , i believe , been too quickly accepted in its old english root-meaning of "" deserving "" , whereas i have yet to see any contexts that contradict its other meaning , based on its other old english root , "" appropriate "" . are there any clarifying contexts ? please show i ' m wrong . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - sex and language alexis manaster ramer sent me a personal response to my ideas ; when i asked , he said i could post for general reading . ( btw , what are some of the etymologies given for "" girl "" , "" boy "" , "" marry "" ? ) alexis says : thank you for responding . since we obviously agree about the final resolution of this issue , i guess i would say that there are simply two aspects to the way one must respond to the people who are claiming that the generic he was invented by male chauvinist grammarians . one is yours ( that it has a continuous history within english ) [ did i say that ? - jw ] . the other is mine ( that if we knew nothing about the history of english , the universal picture would authorize us to suppose that this was indeed a natural phenomenon , not an invention of the grammarians ) . but i would then say that the presumed reason why this phenomenon is universal is presumably that all known cultures ( or maybe there is one exception , according to what i read somewhere ) have been male-dominated at all known time periods , and the fact that masculine / male is ' unmarked ' must surely be a reflection of this . so , the locus of the blame [ ! ] shifts from the conscious work of english grammarians to the subconscious workings of the language faculties of countless generations of human beings all over the planet who have lived in societies where there was no concept of sex equality . what do you think ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - jeff responds thanks for the elaboration . what do i think ? first , to get it straight . . . you are saying that comparable structures to "" generic he "" are found in all languages ( with perhaps a few exceptions ) , and on that basis a person might be led to conclude it is a natural phenomenon , but they would be wrong . rather , universal male domination is the explanation , as seen in the unmarked pronoun "" he "" , and we must "" blame "" the subconscious workings of the language faculties of all people in history , who have had no concept of sex equality . i have three questions , each of which i provide some of my own views about . 1 ) what are some of the parameters of and who ( authors ) do you look to for your idea that all history has been male dominated ? ( i personally resent this characterization . ) "" dominated "" hinges on what you mean - - the crimson sunset dominated the horizon and the pimples dominated the young girl 's face . on a group level , men , qua males , have been sufficiently dutiful to "" women and children first "" that they can be said to have historically regarded their own lot as the more expendable , i . e . , at least as might say the contour of a bell-curve measuring such a thing . men subdue the metaphorical colin fergusons of the world , not women . on an individual level , camille paglia nails it when she talks about the substantial power of women over men , qua males , based on women 's power to close their legs . 2 ) where does your concept of linguistic markedness come from , and on what basis do you establish a cause-effect relationship between patriarchy and markedness in pronouns ? my own idea of markedness is based on the original exposition as seen formulated by jakobson and trubetzkoy about 1930 ( see _ on language _ , roman jakobson , ed . linda r . waugh , 1990 . chapter 8 ) . a conclusion opposite to yours ( and gender feminists ) seems evident from the original formulation . their concept of "" the mark "" grew out of interest in binary aspects of language , like past / present , long / short . trubetzkoy wrote , "" only one of the terms of a correlation is perceived as actively modified and as positively possessing some mark , while the other term is perceived as lacking the mark and as passively unmodified "" ( p136 ) . this suggests to me that "" woman "" and "" she "" are "" species "" terms which females "" have "" as an exclusive and special privilege , whereas males do not have a "" species "" name exclusively their own , but instead must suffer to share a "" genus "" designation . it is for this reason i prefer sometimes to call the masculine unmarked words "" tautonyms "" ( i . e . , in biology , one name for both species and genus ) . the editor of the book goes on to comment on the concept : "" thus , the general meaning of _ lion _ , in contradistinction to that of _ lioness _ , implies no sexual specification - - and only the * basic meaning * of _ lion _ prompted by informative contexts suggests a sexual specification : e . g . , _ lions and lionesses _ "" . is n't this saying that man qua male emerges only in contexts that contrast him with the female ? otherwise , he is a generic ( genus , genre ) person and accordingly unmarked - - i . e . , "" just "" a person . the jakobson book continues , "" the constraining , focusing character of the marked term of any grammatical opposition is directed toward a more narrowly specified and delimited conceptual item "" . if men wanted to throw a testy beef about it , they could say , "" how come the gals have exclusive words , but the guys have to share theirs with everybody else ? "" 3 ) finally , you propose that in all past history they ' ve had "" no concept of sex equality "" . there is an inherent chronocentrism ( my term ) in your indictment , but , notwithstanding , i ' m somewhat sure you ' re talking about "" rights "" . "" rights "" , equal or otherwise , is a modern concept that is often muddled and sometimes useless if one considers , as i do , that the more important ends of life are happiness , inner peace , and freedom from fear - - what good are abstract rights if one is miserable all the time ? . the extremely important distinction is too often lost sight of between concepts of inherent rights and entitlement rights . if we discuss "" women 's equality "" and "" men 's equality "" without talking about documents like the universal declaration of human rights , the united states constitution , the code of hammurabi , etc . , or sources of rights , like god or the barrel of a gun , we are not going to get anywhere . if we take into account considerations of class , age , history , geography , etc . , i would argue that on a de facto level , women have had , and continue to have , collectively , an advantage over men . i know that saying so will upset a few of us , even give some of us a little gas and heartburn , my being the direct precipitation of which i apologize for in advance . best regards , jeffrey",Safe Email

"" our long - term strategy to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets supports earnings sustainability , "" chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson said in a statement . "" i would say the company ' s ability to continuously post strong earnings growth illustrates their ability to successfully navigate through wildly various operating environments , "" ubs warburg analyst jay yannello said . "" this company has rapidly emerged as the leading player in its field . "" while stocks in its sector have been hammered sharply over the past six months , dynegy has been a better performer than similar companies . dynegy ' s stock this year has fallen some 15 percent , outperforming the standard & poor ' s utilities index , which has lost 21 percent . despite the strong earnings growth , shares of dynegy were down $ 1 . 02 , or 2 . 34 percent , to $ 42 . 63 in monday afternoon trading . analysts cited rumors that the california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) wants to renegotiate the power purchase contracts that the california department of water resources holds with companies like dynegy , calpine corp . , mirant corp . and williams cos . inc . . a spokesman for the department of water resources , however , said it doesn ' t plan to renegotiate the deals . "" these companies renegotiate contracts all the time . the question is , do they maintain value in the contracts or do they lose value in the contracts ? "" said analyst jeff dietert of simmons and co . "" and i think the assumption that the market is making is that dynegy and others would lose value in their contracts . "" dynegy still has an accounts receivable balance of about $ 320 to $ 325 million for power it produced for cash - challenged california utilities . "" we ' re not out of the woods yet , "" said president and chief operating officer stephen bergstrom on a conference call . but he noted there could be some resolution by the second or third quarter of next year . after all , pg & e corp . ' s pacific and gas electric utility sought bankruptcy in april and filed a reorganization plan on sept . 20 . edison international ' s southern california edison utility plans to pay off its creditors by march , under a settlement it reached with the cpuc . wholesale income nearly doubles dynegy marketing and trade , the company ' s main wholesale business , reported an 85 percent year - over - year increase in recurring net income , taking in $ 263 million this year compared with $ 142 million in the comparable quarter in 2000 . among other things , dynegy trades wholesale natural gas , power , coal , emission allowances and weather derivatives . the company attributed part of its improved performance this quarter to better results in european and canadian operations , including increased gas marketing in canada . north american natural gas volumes grew 12 percent to 11 . 0 billion cubic feet per day ( bcf / d ) in the quarter , rising from 9 . 8 bcf / d in the year - earlier period . total physical power sales increased 86 percent to 90 . 5 million megawatt hours ( mwh ) in the 2001 third quarter , compared with 48 . 7 million mwh in the same quarter a year ago . dynegydirect , the company ' s online trading platform for more than 750 products and services , recorded nearly $ 10 billion in transactions in the third quarter , the company said . since its birth in november 2000 , dynegydirect has recorded $ 33 billion in transactions . dynegy recently expanded the platform , its answer to hometown rival enron corp . ' s wildly successful enrononline trading platform , into british energy markets . one nominally lower performer this year was illinois power , dynegy ' s regulated transmission and distribution subsidiary . it reported recurring net income of $ 26 million versus $ 27 million a year earlier . dynegy attributed the smaller figure to a reduced industrial load . the company ' s new communications segment took a $ 15 million loss for the quarter , mostly from costs associated with developing its 16 , 000 - mile network . the network reaches 44 u . s . cities and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter . dynegy expects that segment to record a fourth - quarter loss of nil to 3 cents a share and a full - year loss of 13 cents to 16 cents a share . for 2002 , the company expects the unit to be at breakeven by the end of the year .

( ene ) , an ice press release said tuesday , without mentioning enron by name . investors have been watching to see if enron ' s trading partners in its core business - north american gas and power marketing - significantly reduce activities with the financially troubled top energy marketer . ice is considered a primary alternative to enron ' s internet - based commodities market , enrononline . ice ' s volume of north american bulk power trades last week totaled a record 54 million megawatt - hours , a 34 % increase over the october weekly average . north american natural gas volumes rose 13 % from october to 950 billion cubic feet last week . oil trading rose 45 % to a record 55 million barrels , and metals trading volumes was up 66 % . "" we believe that this has resulted , in part , from the uncertainty that has been exhibited in several key energy trading venues over the pas several months , "" said ice chief executive , jeffry sprecher . enrononline is different from ice because enrononline is a mechanism for companies to buy from , and sell to , enron . ice is a neutral multiparty exchange , allowing energy trading companies to trade with all other members . ice ' s trading system , which has been installed in 7 , 000 desktops worldwide , covers 600 commodity and derivative contract types . ice also owns the international petroleum exchange of london , europe ' s largest energy futures exchange . ice is owned by companies including american electric power ( aep ) , aquila energy ( ila ) , bp amoco plc ( bp ) , deutshe bank ag ( g . dbk ) , el paso corp .

' s ( pge ) securities as follows : senior secured debt to ' bbb + ' from ' a ' ; senior unsecured debt to ' bbb ' from ' a - ' ; preferred stock to ' bbb - ' from ' bbb + ' . the rating watch status has been revised to evolving from negative for all intermediate - to long - term securities . a rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised , lowered or maintained . pge ' s commercial paper has been downgraded to ' f 2 ' from ' fl ' , with a stable outlook . the downgrades for pge reflect substantial ongoing uncertainty at its parent , enron ( ene ) . ene ' s senior unsecured debt is rated ' bbb - ' , with a rating watch evolving . ene ' s financial flexibility has been severely impaired as a result of recent developments primarily surrounding its investment in structured transactions . on oct . 16 , 2001 , ene announced a $ 1 billion after tax charge to third quarter 2001 earnings and a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction to balance sheet equity relating to the unwinding of structured transactions . in addition , the company has restated its financial results for the 1997 - 2000 period , incorporating off - balance sheet entries related to the structured transactions and is the subject of a securities and exchange commission ( sec ) investigation focusing on the company ' s accounting for the partnerships . these events badly eroded investor confidence in the company , effectively blocking its ability to access capital markets , and forcing management to seek a corporate suitor . on nov . 9 , 2001 , dynegy ( dyn ) announced that it reached a definitive agreement to acquire ene in a stock - for - stock transaction under which ene shareholders will receive a fixed amount of dyn shares . the proposed dyn transaction will provide significant financial support to ene , and should enable ene to fund its cash needs through the first quarter of 2002 under expected business conditions , despite ene ' s significant refinancing risk . the merger requires regulatory approvals , including hart - scott - rodino , the sec , and the federal regulatory energy commission ; assuming regulators approve the merger , we would expect the transaction to close in six - to nine - months . the merger agreement includes termination provisions that add an element of uncertainty to its completion . fitch anticipates that the surviving company ' s rating would move to the mid - ' bbb ' range assuming the successful execution of its interim plans to delever its capital structure and the completion of the merger . if the merger were terminated fitch believes ene ' s ability to manage its business would be severely impaired and would expect to downgrade its securities to highly speculative levels . pge ' s new ratings also recognize its strong standalone credit profile , the prospective regulatory ring - fencing required by oregon regulators , and the pending sale of pge to northwestern natural gas ( nwn ) , in addition to its interim status as a subsidiary of ene . the evolving status for pge recognizes that its ratings could drop if the ene / dyn merger were terminated , or improve , if ene ' s credit rating is upgraded in the future . pge ' s credit quality ratios and financial strength are expected to temporarily weaken in 2001 , reflecting the absence of cash recovery of unusually high wholesale power costs . in august 2001 , the oregon public utility commission ( opuc ) authorized higher pge rates , effective october 1 , 2001 , to recover such costs . importantly , the commission order adopted a power cost adjustment mechanism that will allow the company to pass through the lion ' s share of its power procurement costs to customers on a timely basis in the future . the cash recovery of power procurement costs allowed in the opuc order , combined with declining wholesale power procurement costs over the balance of this year should alleviate financial pressure at pge and facilitate improving credit measures in 2002 . the pge ratings consider fitch ' s assessment of nwn ' s acquisition funding plan and the anticipated post - merger holding company structure . nwn recently announced an agreement to acquire pge from ene in a transaction valued at $ 2 . 9 billion , including the assumption of $ 1 . 1 billion of pge debt . the transaction is expected to close by the end of 2002 and requires several regulatory approvals , including the sec , the opuc , and the washington utilities and transportation commission . as part of the transaction , nwn expects to form a new holding company ( holdco ) , which will raise the new debt and equity required to complete the purchase of pge . post - merger , pge and nwn will operate as wholly owned first tier subsidiaries of holdco . as currently contemplated , the approximate $ 1 . 8 billion cash portion will be funded at holdco with approximately 78 % debt and 22 % common equity and hybrid convertible preferred stock . as a result , holdco ' s consolidated and individual credit measures are expected to be relatively weak , as consolidated debt to capitalization could reach 75 % at closing . pge ' s ultimate post - merger ratings will depend on several factors , including , the ability to gain operating synergies from its affiliation with nwn , the credit ratings fitch assigns to holdco , and the structural protections provided pge investors by state utility regulators . the current regulatory ring - fencing applied by the opuc requires pge to maintain a 48 % common equity ratio , thereby limiting the amount of cash pge can dividend up to its parent company . it is expected that similar ring - fencing from the opuc will continue under the new holdco structure . contact : fitch , new york philip smyth , 1 -

sized natural gas pipeline company , created in 1986 in the merger of houston natural gas and internorth , to the world ' s largest and most innovative energy trader . enron ' s market capitalization has fallen almost $ 19 billion in just the the past month as investor confidence has waned amid a regulatory probe of off - balance - sheet transactions . dynegy has agreed to acquire enron in a stock swap worth some $ 9 billion , a fraction of what enron was worth a year ago . shares of enron were up 43 cents , or 4 . 65 percent , at $ 9 . 67 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . us spot coal : prices drift lower on slack demand , enron 11 / 13 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones averages not volume weighted 4 q ' 01 lq ' 02 cal 2002 central appalachia low sulfur f . o . b . barge $ 30 . 00 -

' ' frances laserson , moody ' s vice president of corporate communications , declined to comment . ` ` our discussions with clients are highly confidential , ' ' she said . critical role moody ' s played a critical role in part because enron was already having trouble raising money . the company had had its rating lowered in october and a slowdown in the economy had prompted some banks to restrict credit . a downgrade to junk by moody ' s , which rates more than $ 85 trillion in securities , would have created a cash crisis by forcing enron to repay early $ 3 . 3 billion of bonds and limiting its ability to sell short - term debt . a junk rating would have prompted dynegy to abandon the acquisition , said watson , and cost lehman , j . p . morgan chase & co . and salomon smith barney inc . a collective $ 105 million in fees for advising the two companies . in seeking to salvage the rating , the executives argued a downgrade to junk would lead enron to file for bankruptcy protection . they said moody ' s would shoulder the blame , according to people involved in the conversations . on thursday morning , moody ' s was willing to take that risk . executives at the ratings company , led by chief administration officer debra perry , told watson and his bankers at lehman that it was about to issue a press release cutting enron to junk . moody ' s officials said enron couldn ' t keep an investment grade rating because the company had no access to the commercial paper market . a probe by the securities and exchange commission into its accounting practices and a 90 percent plunge in its shares had eroded investor confidence . calling on friends with little time to respond , watson and senior wall street bankers swung into action . watson called his friend david o ' reilly , chief executive officer of chevrontexaco inc . , dynegy ' s largest shareholder . o ' reilly didn ' t have time at such short notice to push enron ' s case , watson said . next he enlisted john watson , chevrontexaco ' s chief financial officer , and darald callahan , a member of the boards of dynegy and chevrontexaco , to call moody ' s . lehman ' s ceo fuld and chief fixed - income analyst ted izatt also pitched in , as did j . p . morgan ceo harrison and michael carpenter , who runs salomon , a citigroup inc . unit . izatt , the no . 1 ranked analyst for investment grade energy companies according to institutional investor magazine , previously worked as a managing director at moody ' s . j . p . morgan chase and salomon were advising enron . officials at lehman , j . p . morgan chase and salomon declined to comment through spokespeople . fees watson said he and other bankers argued a combined dynegy and enron would be a much stronger company given a $ 1 . 5 billion cash injection from chevrontexaco , which owns 26 percent of dynegy . ` ` to be honest , i didn ' t understand why moody ' s was having difficulties making this happen , ' ' watson said . later that day , moody ' s executives told dynegy they were prepared to keep enron at investment grade as long as six changes were made to the proposed acquisition , according to watson . most of the changes focused around the ` ` material adverse change ' ' clause , which allowed dynegy to cancel the deal under certain conditions . one of those changes would have required dynegy to eliminate a clause that allowed the company to walk away if enron ' s debt ratings were cut to junk . watson said he agreed to the changes . ` ` if things got bad enough at enron that it had to be taken to junk , there would probably be a material change in its business that would allow us to walk away , ' ' he said . chevrontexaco watson and kenneth lay , enron ' s ceo , signed off on the revised terms on thursday . chevrontexaco , however , had yet to agree . o ' reilly first heard of the changes from lehman bankers at a dinner on thursday night celebrating chevron corp . ' s $ 45 . 8 billion acquisition of texaco inc . , that was being held at the victor stewart steakhouse in walnut creek , san francisco , according to people at the dinner . lehman ' s bankers , including steve wolitzer , co - head of mergers and acquisitions , and two colleagues , carlos fierro and grant porter , flew to san francisco that day to participate because they had advised chevron on the deal . during the flight they received emails on their blackberry pagers from colleagues in houston detailing the concessions that moody ' s had sought . tuna steaks after discussing the new terms with o ' reilly over tuna steaks and filet mignon , the group agreed to reconvene at chevron ' s offices in san ramon , california at 6 : 45 a . m . local time friday morning . while the officials were deliberating , moody ' s cut its rating on enron to ` ` baa 3 , ' ' one level above junk . john diaz , a managing director who follows the company for moody ' s , said at the time that enron now needs to ` ` shore up confidence in the company so that counter - parties continue to trade with it . ' ' moody ' s maintained its negative outlook . chevron still needed more time to consider the terms . at 5 : 50 p . m . new york time o ' reilly called dynegy ' s watson to tell him chevron ' s board had agreed . about 15 minutes later , enron and dynegy announced the purchase . ` ` it ' s amazing how this deal came together , ' ' watson said . enron corp . raised to ` maintain position ' at edward jones 2001 - 11 - 13 10 : 44 ( new york ) princeton , new jersey , nov . 13 ( bloomberg data ) - - enron corp . ( ene us ) was raised to ` ` maintain position ' ' from ` ` reduce ' ' by analyst brian youngberg at edward jones . lemon laws won ' t save dynegy by peter eavis > senior columnist realmoney . com 11 / 13 / 2001 07 : 21 am est if you believe dynegy ' s ( dyn : nyse - news - commentary ) account of its planned purchase of energy - trading rival enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) , it ' s getting a slightly damaged mercedes for the price of a pinto . at face value , it appears to be a fabulous deal . dynegy is acquiring a weakened - but - repairable competitor on the cheap . so what ' s not to like ? the problem is , dynegy seems to be taking a rather sunny view of enron ' s future . recent earnings restatements and other revelations suggest enron may actually be a junker when it comes to profitability , though enron ' s disclosure practices make it impossible to know for sure . then there are indications that dynegy doesn ' t expect to write down the value of enron assets by large amounts , which , if true , will certainly raise eyebrows , given the poor performance of many enron businesses . if dynegy proves to have been optimistic in its merger math , investors may start betting against this deal . such an outcome would increase suspicions that dynegy rushed into this merger because an enron collapse would ' ve cratered its business . echoing statements from dynegy executives on a monday conference call , company spokesman steve stengel denied his company is doing the merger because it feared being damaged by an enron collapse . dynegy actually owes enron money , rather than the other way ' round , he said . "" enron ' s core business is strong , and that was a key reason dynegy undertook merger discussions with enron , "" stengel remarks . both stocks rose sharply monday , enron adding 61 cents to $ 9 . 24 and dynegy rising $ 5 . 55 , or 14 % , to $ 44 . 31 . still , enron remains 22 % below dynegy ' s implied acquisition price . the stock action suggests the market is deeply divided over the deal . the deep discount on enron is a sign that the deal won ' t get done . yet dynegy ' s leap implies solid investor backing for the transaction and its economics . until we know more about enron ' s numbers , we won ' t be able to judge whether dynegy investors are right to be bullish , however . strong indeed among the deal ' s avid supporters were a number of sell - side analysts who are longtime enron bulls . they particularly liked dynegy ' s prediction that the combined entity , to be called dynegy , would post earnings 35 % above current 2002 estimates for stand - alone dynegy . and these bulls point out that this accretion number doesn ' t include any merger synergies and it assumes enron ' s 2002 earnings are $ 1 . 50 , which is 25 % lower than analysts currently expect . dynegy executives repeatedly stated monday that they wanted to get rid of enron ' s noncore operations and keep the trading business , which has contributed the lion ' s share of enron earnings , as well as pipeline assets . clearly , dynegy believes that enron ' s core trading business made real profits . how much of a leap of faith is that ? a considerable one . as this column has noted , enron doesn ' t make it possible to break out profit margins for trading , which is included in the wholesale line in enron ' s income statements . in fact , the wholesale line includes substantial asset gains , many of which are probably one - time in nature . enron ' s deals with obscure partnerships gave a huge boost to profits , according to earnings restatements made last week . don ' t forget that it ' s these partnership dealings that are under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . without them , and excluding one - time sales , enron ' s traders may actually make very little . marky mark one fear was that dynegy would have to mark down enron ' s underperforming assets by billions of dollars . charges erode equity . lower equity would possibly mean a higher debt - to - capital ratio ( calculated by taking debt as a percentage of total capital , or debt plus equity ) . if this ratio gets above 50 % to 55 % , rating agencies might consider downgrading dynegy , which could deter counterparties from trading with it . but dynegy expects the debt - to - capital ratio to be about 40 % in the merged institution . somewhat implausibly , dynegy ' s forecasts don ' t appear to factor in big markdowns in enron equity . in the third quarter of next year , enron ' s equity is expected to be $ 9 . 5 billion . that ' s only slightly below what it probably was at the end of this year ' s third quarter ( enron still hasn ' t released a third - quarter balance sheet ) . how can it not decrease over the next 12 months ? a person familiar with the matter says that dynegy also expects to mark up enron assets at the time of the deal ' s closing . these markups are expected to at least partially offset any markdowns , this person adds . but it ' s tough to identify any enron assets that could qualify for hefty positive adjustments , while it ' s easier to point out assets that deserve negative ones . dynegy needs to break out markups and markdowns and reveal which assets are being subject to the adjustments . dynegy ' s stengel didn ' t comment on the question of equity writedowns . by stretching too far in its assumptions , dynegy may be trying to dress up a risky merger as a safe one . but a risky merger may , in dynegy ' s view , have been preferable to having enron go down . again and again monday , dynegy execs said they ' ve done their due diligence and they believe that there aren ' t any huge skeletons in enron ' s closet that could upset the merger . but contrast this stance with that of standard & poor ' s analysts , who said friday that they would ' ve downgraded enron ' s debt to junk status if dynegy hadn ' t agreed to buy enron . one of the s & p analysts said friday that they didn ' t have a full understanding of all the partnerships that enron has been dealing with . if s & p , which , like other rating agencies , has been locked in deep and detailed discussions with enron for weeks , doesn ' t know the effect of all the partnerships , how can dynegy ? "" dynegy has been doing business with enron for 16 years . we know them and they know us , "" stengel replies . "" we are comfortable with the due diligence we have conducted thus far and will continue to look at enron and their operations in the coming weeks and months . "" until dynegy comes up with more details , assume enron is a pinto . dynegy asked ferc to revise regs cbsmarketwatch . com , 11 / 13 / 01 lisa sanders houston ( cbs . mw ) - - long before enron and its northern natural gas pipeline entered the picture , dynegy complained to the federal energy regulatory commission about companies with pipeline systems crowding out competitors from the natural gas transmission market . in a filing dated jan . 5 , 2001 , dynegy ( dyn ) asked to speak in front of the ferc about what it characterized as "" affiliate abuse and structural preferences , "" which are "" alive and growing in the gas industry . "" now , even if dynegy ' s $ 9 billion takeover of enron fails , the power generator can keep the energy trader ' s northern natural gas pipeline , according to the merger agreement . "" they ' re kind of complaining about themselves now , "" said raymond plank , chairman and chief executive of natural gas and oil producer houston - based apache corp . ( apa ) , in an interview . northern natural is enron ' s ( ene ) largest transmission system with 17 , 000 miles of pipeline . "" our position has not changed , "" dynegy spokesman steve stengel said in an e - mail to cbs . marketwatch . com . "" we do not believe that companies should be able to ' abuse ' their power within a market and we also believe that regulators need to continue to monitor markets to ensure market abuse does not occur . "" in a subsequent e - mail , stengel said "" we are going to comply fully with ferc regulations . "" the answer was in response to a question about how dynegy plans to guard against abuse once it owns a pipeline system . in the executive summary dynegy filed to the ferc , the company claimed that structural affiliate preference "" is a far greater threat to market participants in coming years . "" dynegy contended that a pipeline or transmission company affiliate "" can always pay more , or withstand greater risk from , services purchased from home pipelines because of the benefits inuring to the parent holding company . "" dynegy also alleged that because affiliates control the pipelines , they crowd out competitors . one concern dynegy listed is the "" vertical overlapping "" of gas pipeline companies and utilities . dynegy owns the electric and gas utility illinois power . in its comments , dynegy advocated structural changes to the affiliate relationship in order to prevent abuse of the system and eliminate the preference problem . dynegy also recommended that if "" rampant "" abuse is found , the company should be required to divest the non - regulated affiliate . "" on sept . 26 , the ferc issued a statement proposing a set of uniformly applied regulations to oversee the relationship between regulated transmission providers and their energy affiliates . citing the sweeping changes in both the gas and electricity markets , the ferc said that current rules "" fail to address the sharing of confidential shipper information and transportation information with all energy affiliates . "" the ferc proposed that the employees of transmission providers involved in the operation of transmission systems function apart from the providers ' sales or marketing employees and energy affiliates . "" in addition , the prohibition on preferential sharing of transmission information would be broadened to include all energy affiliates , "" the ferc stated . apache ' s plank said his company is in the process of figuring out how best to help . apache wants to take the volatility out of the energy market , and he pegs dynegy and enron as major contributors to the situation . "" the government says they believe in transparency , but they believe it applies to everyone ( else ) , "" he said .

LAGOS - NIGERIA. ATTN:  
REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP. It is with my profound dignity that I write you this
very important
and highly confidential letter. First, I must
solicit your strictest
confidentiality in this transaction. This is by
virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and ""TOP SECRET"".
Though I know that a
transaction of this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and
worried,considering the fact that we have not met
each other before,
but I am assuring you that all will be well at the
end of the day. We
have decided to contact you by email due to the
urgency of this
transaction, as we have been reliably informed that
it will take at
least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal
post to reach you,
so we decided it is best using the e-mail,which is
quicker and also
to enable us meet up with the second quater payment
for the year
2000. However, let me start by introducing myself properly
to you. I
am Dr.tom eke, a Director General in the Department
Of Petroleum 
Resources(D.P.R) and I presently head The Contract
Award Panel incharge
of Contract Awards and Payment Approvals. I came to
know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to
handle a very confidential business transaction
which involves the
transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account
requiring
maximum CONFIDENCE. I and my colleagues are Top
Officials of the
Federal Government Contract Award Panel. Our duties
include Evaluation, Vetting, Approval for payment of
Contract jobs
done for the D.P.R e.t.c. In order to commence this
business we
solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer
into your Account
the said funds. The source of this funds is as
follows: In the second
quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to
review and award
contracts to the tune of US$400 million US dollars
to a group of five
firms for the supply construction and installation
of Oil Pipe lines
in Warri and Port Harcourt. During this process my
colleagues and I
decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately
over-inflate the
total contract sum from US$400 million to US$431
million United
States dollars with the main intention of sharing
the remaining sum
of US$31 miilion amongst ourselves. The Federal Government of Nigeria has since the
second quater of	
year 2001 approved the sum of US$431 million for us
as the contract sum, 
and the sum of US$400 million has also been paid to
the foreign companies 
concerned as contract entitlements for the various
contracts done, but 
since the companies are entiltled to US$400 million
dollars only, we are 
now left with US$31 million dollars balance in the
account which we intend to
disburse amongst ourselves, but by virtue of our
positions as civil
servants and members of this panel, we cannot do
this by ourselves,
as we are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau
(Civil Service
Laws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts
in our names
while still in Government service, making it
impossible for us to
acquire the money in our names right now. I have
therefore, been
delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my
colleagues in the
panel to look for an overseas partner into whose
account we would
transfer the sum of US$31 million. Hence we are
writing you this
letter. My Colleagues and I have agreed that if you
or your company
can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our
behalf, you or your
Company will retain 20% of the total amount (US$31
million), while
70% will be for us(OFFICIALS) and the remaining 10%
will be used in
offsetting all debts/expenses and Taxes incurred
both local and
foreign in the cause of this transfer. Needless to
say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In
return we demand your
complete honesty and trust. You must however NOTE that this transaction will be
strictly based 
on the following terms and conditions as we have
stated below; 
a) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence 
b) That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality 
c) That you will not ask for more share or try to
sit on the funds once it is under
your custody, or any form of blackmail. 
d) That upon receipt of the funds you will release
the funds as instructed 
by us after you have removed your share of 20% from
the total amount. 
Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude
this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days
from the date 
of receipt of the necessary requirements from you .
We are looking 
forward to doing business with you and solicit your
Total Confidentiality
in this transaction. There is no cause for alarm. I
give you my word that you
are completely safe in doing business with us.
Transactions like this
have been successfully carried out in the past by
most Government
executives. Here in my country there is great
economic and political
disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant
and the order of
the day, thus explaining why you might have heard
stories of how
money is been taken out of Nigeria, this is because
everyone is
making desperate attempts to secure his or her
future, so that when
we retire from active service we donot languish in
poverty. I will
explain more to you when I have heard from you. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using
the above e-mail address. 
I will bring you into the complete picture of this
pending business
transaction when I have heard from you and also
receive your
confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me
fax to you all
necessary information you need to know about our
pending business
transaction. I will also send to you my private
telephone and fax
numbers where you can always reach me. Your urgent
response will be
highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds
under the second
quarter of the year 2002. Thank you and God Bless. Yours faithfully, Dr.tom eke. N.B. PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THIS BUSINESS
TRANSACTION IS 100% LEGAL
AND COMPLETELY FREE FROM DRUG MONEY OR MONEY
LAUNDERING. THIS IS A
COMPLETE LEGITIMATE BUSINESS TRANSACTION.

Dear Grant Seeker,

United States are receiving millions of dollars from these Government and

This money is not a loan,

and requires a lot of paperwork, only to find out that you've been denied.

requirements that banks do.
You decide how much money
you need, as long as it's a lawful amount and meets with the Government
Agencies criteria, the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid.
This money is non taxable & interest free.
None of these programs require
a credit check, collateral, security deposits or co-signers, you can apply
even if you have a bankruptcy or bad credit, it doesn't matter, you as
a tax payer and U.S. citizen are entitled to this money.

1,400 Federal Programs, 24,000 State Programs, 30,000 Private Foundations

Getting Business

Anyone thinking about going
into business for themselves, or wanting to expand an existing business
should rush for the world's largest ""one-stop-money-shop"" where FREE business
grants to start or expand a business is being held for you by the Federal
Government.
It
sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the United
States of America wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source
of free business help delivers:
Over $30 billion dollars in free
business grants and low-interest loans;
over one-half trillion dollars in
procurement contracts; and
over $32 billion dollars in FREE
consulting and research grants.
With an economy that remains
unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!
In
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
Most
people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.The fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive FREE GRANTS MONEY and other benefits from the government, and you
should also.Government Grants

"article : ' metals screen trade set to evolve ' please find attached the above article from the rueters english news service , october 12 , 2001 . uk : interview - metals screen trade set to evolve - spectron . by andy blamey 10 / 12 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . london , oct 12 ( reuters ) - electronic trading of base metals futures has established a firm foothold in the market but the nature of online trading platforms looks set to evolve further , says gavin gross , head of lme metals at spectron futures ltd . uk - based energy and commodities broker spectron ' s electronic platform for the trading of london metal exchange ( lme ) contracts has become required viewing for traders alongside the lme ' s own system lme select and the enron group ' s enrononline . "" i think we ' ve proved that people will trade lme derivatives contracts online , because there are some great advantages to doing so , "" gross told reuters in a telephone interview . "" and unlike the physical markets , where things haven ' t really taken off online , all three platforms are pretty much indispensable to the market . "" both spectron and lme select are neutral platforms in which category 1 and category 2 lme members trade with each other , while enrononline is open to a wider membership but has enron itself as the sole counterparty in each transaction . this leaves a gap in the market for a multi - party trading system open to industry participants beyond the immediate trading community , gross suggested . "" i think the clear trend for metals derivatives trading for the future is for open platforms which would allow dealers and clients in the market to interact with each other online , "" he said . direct access for clients to an electronic trading environment could mean changes in the role of the broker , he said . "" clients will have the advantage of more control , more visibility and more transparency in what they do . however , they ' ll have to pay for services , "" gross said . "" you could see a situation where dealers specialise in different areas - certain dealers would provide credit functions , certain institutions would provide clearing , others would provide execution and certain companies would provide market - making . "" difficult conditions difficult market conditions are already forcing metals traders to rethink their activities ; this week alone has seen n . m . rothschild & sons exit base metals trading and both bank of nova scotia and enron looking to scale back . "" on the lme now you ' ve got low volumes , falling volatilities , falling prices and we ' re in the grips of a bear market . it ' s very , very poor for business in general , "" gross said . "" there are too many dealers around chasing a shrinking amount of business . . . each company is going to have to look very carefully at their business and their staffing levels . "" spectron has not been immune from declining volumes . "" our volumes for the first 12 months of operation were fantastic , way beyond what we had expected . however , our volumes have fallen in the recent quarter , "" gross said . "" that ' s due to two factors : first , the overall market activity is lower , and second lme select has managed to attract some of the business that we would previously have had 100 percent of . "" the company is now looking at ways to further develop its trading platform . "" we ' re beginning to investigate ways to add certain features and do things differently . that might involve creating an alternative platform where clients could access prices and thereby widen the service , "" gross said . but , he stressed , "" we have to keep the interests of our dealer clients foremost . "" uncertainty in the current environment , the lme ' s refusal to throw its weight behind either open - outcry floor trade or its new screen system - the exchange has taken pains not to express any preference and to "" allow the market to decide "" - may prove to be counterproductive , gross said . "" by having two systems running side by side . . . the exchange is almost moving in two totally different directions , "" he said . "" there ' s a feeling that the ring is doomed , which doesn ' t do anything to encourage its use , while the reluctance to fully back electronic trading means that you ' re still only seeing a trickle of business going through select in terms of overall volumes . "" while preferences vary in different sectors of the market , the current uncertainty is helping no - one , he said : "" metals traders just want to trade . they just want to know with some kind of certainty how the market will be structured in future so they can structure their business to support that and make money .

 A 
        Situation That Could Revolutionize the Health Care Industry
  STRONGï¿½HEALTHï¿½CAREï¿½SECTORï¿½GROWTH 
              ï¿½Most investors desire to be in a stock from the beginning 
              of its growth, ï¿½IBXGï¿½ is one of those opportunities. 
              Revenues to increase over 500 % 
              to over $18 Million from $3 Million with its 
              pending acquisition of 47 physical therapy outpatient centers and 
              institutional pharmacy businesses, currently owned by CyberCare, 
              Inc. ï¿½IBXGï¿½ also just announced a national alliance 
              with Patient-Pay.com 
              that will enable ï¿½IBXGï¿½ to market its services on a 
              national scale. We believe the potential is enormous for this expanding 
              dynamic Health Care Information Technology Company.HEALTHï¿½CAREï¿½SECTORï¿½REREPRESENTSï¿½15%ï¿½OFï¿½THEï¿½TOTALï¿½US 
              GROSSï¿½DOMESTICï¿½PRODUCT While inflation 
              in the US has been around 2% per year, the US Health Careï¿½s 
              inflationary rate rose over 11% per year. Health care costs are 
              spiraling out of control. ï¿½IBXGï¿½ provides technology 
              based products and services in full compliance with newly mandated 
              government requirements (HIPAA), that help medical professionals 
              save time and money, by utilizing ï¿½IBXGï¿½s state of the 
              art systems.UNDERSTANDINGï¿½HIPAA 
              The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
              (Publicï¿½Lawï¿½104-191), 
              also known as HIPAA, was enacted as part of a broad Congressional 
              attempt at incremental healthcare reform. Part of the law requires 
              the US Dept. of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to develop standards 
              and requirements for maintenance and transmission of health information 
              that identifies individual patients. The requirements outlined by 
              the law are far-reaching for all healthcare organizations that maintain 
              or transmit electronic health information must comply. ï¿½IBXGï¿½ 
              offers all health care providers with a viable, already in place 
              solution to ï¿½HIPAAï¿½ compliance.IBXGï¿½ï¿½SPECIALIZESï¿½INï¿½HEALTHï¿½DATAï¿½MANAGEMENT 
              It is a huge market comprised of over one million health care professionals. 
              This company has emerged, with solutions to many problems facing 
              the Health Care Industry, by providing health care professionals 
              the ability to deliver outstanding patient care with optimum efficiency. 
              In past years, venture capitalists have invested more than $20 billion 
              in information technology companies, confirming a very large financial 
              interest in the health care sector.              WILLï¿½IBXGï¿½REVOLUTIONIZEï¿½THEï¿½HEALTHï¿½CAREï¿½INDUSTRY?

ALB> Thu Aug 29,10:19 AM ET
ALB> By Andrew MarshallALB> BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand
ALB> looking for a wife. It took two hours to find her.ALB> ""The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all
ALB> my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""I
ALB> knew then there was something special.""ALB> Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet
ALB> -- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,
ALB> who is expecting their first child.ALB> Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women
ALB> in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that
ALB> often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand
ALB> in search of a wife.ALB> ""I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan,"" he said. ""I knew I
ALB> found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.""ALB> Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in
ALB> touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and
ALB> the couple married.ALB> MR. MARRIAGEALB> Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency
ALB> Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself ""Mr. Marriage,""
ALB> started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction
ALB> agency.ALB> Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.ALB> ""In the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""To the best of my
ALB> knowledge, they have all been successful.""ALB> Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that
ALB> require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.
ALB> Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women
ALB> looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.ALB> Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's
ALB> office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and
ALB> language problems.ALB> ""We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,""
ALB> Lynch said. ""But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.""ALB> After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know
ALB> each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every
ALB> client has found a potential wife.ALB> ""At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and

Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists'Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments -

Ananova:Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists'Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments - 
the two giant white horses - to highlight their cause.Campaigners for the Real Countryside Alliance say they targeted the two 
images, on hills in Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire, ""to keep the pro-hunt 
thing in the papers"".Aerial shots show the 374ft-long Bronze Age image on the Berkshire Downs 
near Uffington in Oxfordshire complete with three white hounds and a rider.In North Yorkshire, a rider in full hunt regalia has been added to the 300ft 
White Horse cut in to the hills at Kilburn, which dates back to the 1700s.But no-one reported anything to the police.A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said no reports had been received but 
he had seen ""a red blob"" on the horse and had sent officers to investigate.In Uffington, no-one in the village had heard anything about the reported 
incident. A spokesman for Thames Valley police said he was not aware of any 
complaints.Activists say the image in Oxfordshire was drawn in paint used for marking 
lines on grass tennis courts and will wash away in the first rains.

Take a look at main/php_variables.c in the php source distribution.
You could mess around with the variable is_array in
php_register_variable_ex() and see if you can force all variables to be
arrays :) As far as I can tell the reason they do this is to save
time by not having to work out which variables have multiple values.Nick

(a) I don't put Orville's name on the headstock and (b) I license the
patented bracing methods.  If I instead try to sell a homebuilt guitar
on eBay with ""Gibson"" written in crayon on the headstock, and then

stop you from making 10000 copies to sell.    M> Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  This is the difficult question:  How will they draw the distinction?
The ""other stuff"" is just as easy to duplicate as the free stuff.
This is why MS is hunting people with illegal Windows; it's no harder
to dup than a Linux CD, only what is there that actually prevents
people from doing it?Personally, I don't think the issue should have anything to do with
sales or units.  The issue is that basic phallacy that says a suit
should be able to ""own"" someone else's intellectual property.  Sarah

the label who stands to lose; Sarah's already fat beyond her wildest
dreams, so a few bucks here or there, or even if the well dried up
tomorrow, it's not going to really traumatize her (unless she's been
blazingly stupid with her money)But the label ... like Disney and Mickey, they need the cash cow so
they can keep all sorts of uncreative hangers-on in limos and coke.
If you thought only Elvis or Brian Jones or Dennis Wilson had problems
with beautiful-people deadbeat leech ""friends"" draining their riches,
think again.The problem is really very simple because it is semantic, and until we
make the semantic flip, it's unsolvable, but like trisecting an angle,
all it takes is looking at the same situation in a different
way.  Here's the revelation: Elvis never ever made a hit record.Elvis didn't make the hits, his /fans/ made the hits.  His fans did
the work cleaning toilets, manning the convenience stores, driving
milk trucks, sitting at endless office desks, they did the /real/
labour that paid for every last one of Elvis Presley's pills.  All
Elvis did was sing into a microphone every so often, and pen or
collect the odd song that all those /people/ liked and wanted as
something of their own.  But it's not _Elvis_ who made them universal
statements, it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs into
their own lives, it was pull-technology, not push.Therefore the question becomes: how many times must these fans pay
before they own what they themselves have created?  They pay royalties
for listening to the radio, for blank tapes, for concert tickets, for
a beer in a bar with a cover band ... they pay over and over and over
again for the /right/ to make some hack writer's song /their/
favourite song????  That's where the whole system has been seriously
warped by the record companies and ad companies reframing it into your
thinking that it is the Elvis who makes the Elvis.  It's not.  It's
the people who make them; the songs are already theirs.--

No forwards go out, no files are made, if I try to log information, no logs are set up. I've modified the user/group and permissions to match known-working recipes (the spermfun example above) and still nothing. However, I can redirect those other messages.

o what are sound methodologies for relating discourse relations with potential realizations ? o are there discourse relations that are always lexically signalled ? are there any that are never lexically signalled ? o what non-lexical ( i . e . , syntactic or prosodic ) means are used to signal a relation ? o in production , how does one decide whether to signal a relation at all ? o in production , how does one motivate a choice among candidate signals for a given relation ? o in production , how does the choice of signal interact with other decisions ( in particular , those of linearizing some tree or graph structure ) ? o in analysis , is it possible to reliably infer discourse relations from surface cues ? o in analysis , how can one disambiguate polysemous signals such as "" and "" , "" since "" ( temporal or causal ) etc . ? o what are useful lexical representations of discourse markers , for both analysis and production ? o what are useful representations of discourse relations ( and the entities they relate ) , such that they facilitate the realization decision ? what features would one like to have handy in a representation so that choices can be made easily ? o are there significant differences between realizations in spoken and written language ? o how do individual languages differ in terms of any of the above issues ? organizing committee the workshop is organized by manfred stede ( tu berlin ) leo wanner ( university of stuttgart ) eduard hovy ( isi / usc , marina del rey ) requirements for submission papers are invited that address any of the topics listed above . maximum length is 8 pages including figures and references . please use a4 or us letter format and set margins so that the text lies within a rectangle of 6 . 5 x 9 inches ( 16 . 5 x 23 cm ) . use classical fonts such as times roman or computer modern , 11 to 12 points for text , 14 to 16 points for headings and title . latex users are encouraged to use the style file provided by acl : http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / colaclsub . sty papers can be submitted either electronically in postscript format , or as hardcopies . submissions from north america should be sent to : eduard hovy information sciences institute 4676 admiralty way marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 u . s . a . hovy @ isi . edu submissions from elsewhere should be sent to either of the following : manfred stede leo wanner tu berlin computer science department kit project group intelligent systems group sekr . fr 6-10 university of stuttgart franklinstr . 28 / 29 breitwiesenstr . 20-22 d-10587 berlin d-70565 stuttgart germany germany stede @ cs . tu-berlin . de wannerlo @ informatik . uni-stuttgart . de timetable deadline for electronic submissions : march 10 , 1998 deadline for hardcopy submissions : march 13 ( arrival date ) notification of acceptance : may 1 , 1998 final manuscripts due : june 12 , 1998 program committee sandra carberry ( u delaware ) barbara dieugenio ( u pittsburgh ) eduard hovy ( usc / isi ) alistair knott ( u edinburgh ) alex lascarides ( u edinburgh ) owen rambow ( cogentex inc . ) ted sanders ( u utrecht ) donia scott ( u brighton ) wilbert spooren ( u tilburg ) manfred stede ( tu berlin ) keith vander linden ( calvin college ) marilyn walker ( att labs ) leo wanner ( u stuttgart ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * call for papers call for papers call for papers acl / coling-98 workshop on partially automated techniques for transcribing naturally occurring , continuous speech august 16 , 1998 ( following acl / coling-98 ) university of montreal , montreal ( quebec , canada ) call for papers description - - - - - - - - - - the development of robust systems for speech analysis and synthesis depends crucially on the availability of well-annotated corpora of naturally occurring , continuous speech . yet existing speech corpora are rarely well-annotated . a key to proper annotation is the availability of partially automated systems for linking selected portions of a visual display of speech to the corresponding transcriptions . to be of practical use , such systems must be able to handle large files of digitized speech and they should permit transcriptions at different levels of analysis . this workshop will be devoted to the presentation and discussion of papers and software demonstrations which reflect the current state of the art . we invite proposals of up to 800 words which address the development , use , evaluation , or potential commercial application of such systems . submissions - - - - - - - - - - only email submissions in latex or ascii will be accepted . authors should submit an abstract of no more than 800 words to : trans98 @ cs . concordia . ca style files and templates for latex submissions can be found at http : / / colingacl98 . iro . umontreal . ca / styles . html the official language of the conference is english . important deadlines - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - submission deadline : april 15 , 1998 notification date : may 15 , 1998 camera ready copy due : june 15 , 1998 program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - nancy belmore concordia university , canada sabine bergler concordia university , canada john esling univ . of victoria , canada eric keller univ . of lausanne , switzerland roland kuhn panasonic technologies , inc . , u . s . a . douglas o'shaughnessy inrs - telecommunications , canada ching y . suen concordia university , canada organizers - - - - - - - - - nancy belmore concordia university , canada sabine bergler concordia university , canada douglas o'shaughnessy inrs - telecommunications , canada registration - - - - - - - - - - - there is a discounted workshop fee for participants of coling / acl . participants who are not registered for coling / acl will have to pay the full workshop fee ( to be announced shortly ) . information - - - - - - - - - - any requests for information should be sent to trans98 @ cs . concordia . ca",Safe Email

Related to the MS acquisition of XDegrees?==
http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/1466271Sun Nabs Storage Startup
By Clint Boulton
Amid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San
Francisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data
storage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup
with a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices and
virtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),
virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices
into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that
is managed from a central console.Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes
of Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after
scouting some 65 companies.Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com
that Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible
acquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of
storage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such
as Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.""This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7
or 8 system-level players,"" Lovington said. ""Sun sees this acquisition as a
critical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious.""N1 is Sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)
architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a
role in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled
as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and
networks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground
in the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,
according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of
IDC's Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest
increases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,
respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of
$411 million.Sun's acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of
Sun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.",Safe Email

"Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):> I'm confused. I thought it was GPL'ed and that the money you paid SuSE
> was for your 60 day support or whatever? Yes, you're confused.A Linux distribution (_any_ Linux distribution) contains lots and lots
of separate codebases.  Some are under the GNU GPL.  Many are not.  Are
you clear on this point, now?  This is my second try.  One suspects that
you actually understand perfectly, but just don't like it.You're further confused if you think the GNU GPL gives you the right to
get covered software for free.  It does not.  It provides that _if_
you've lawfully received a copy of the covered binary version, you have
rights to also receive the matching source code.> I don't particularly need support, so I'm not really interested in
> purchasing a set of disks with 4 billion apps which I'll never use.Then, if you nonetheless want a SuSE boxed set's contents, the only way
you can do that without copyright violation _and_ without having to pay
the purchase price is to get someone to _give_ (not ""lend"" or duplicate) 
you his copy.> Yes, thanks for your input. Anyway, I've a friend with 7.3 pro, so
> I'll just ask him.Ask him _what_?  If you're asking him to ""lend"" or duplicate his CDs,
then you'll be ripping off SuSE Linux AG illegally.Don't like SuSE's product licensing?  Write your own distribution.  You
can even grab most of what you need _from SuSE_.  All you have to do is 
heed the licensing terms on the individual pieces.What, you think that's too much work?  Then, try a different
distribution.  Clue:  _Not_ one packaged in a retail boxed set.  Even RH
7.3 retail boxed sets include non-freely redistributable applications on
the Star office 5.2 CD and the Productivity Applications CD, among
others.  (The core 3-CD set of the basic RH distribution, on the other
hand, contains only software that may be freely redistributed, whether 
open source or not.)--
