today!I've got a few quick Lockergnome-related notes for you today.First, we'd really like to see you in August. I know that Jake, Chris and Randy have been signing off on their newsletters with those few words, and I'll join them. If you didn't experience Gnomedex last year, you missed, in the words of many industry insiders, ""The show of the year."" It was unlike any other computer conference I've ever attended. Unlike any conference I've attended, period, computer-related or not. While most such conferences are a huge hustle and hassle, Gnomedex was what computing and Lockergnome are all about - sharing useful information, gathering with like-minded enthusiasts, and learning to use your chosen computer to the fullest extent. No hustle. No hassle. No BS. For the minimal cost of registration, it would be hard to find a better weekend for geeks and wannabes alike. Add to that the schedule of luminaries presenting and attending and you've got the best deal on the planet for computer users. It's hard to believe we're less than a month away - I really do hope to see you there.Another Lockergnome innovation has hit the newsstands - err, bookstores. That's right. Jake has release a FREE GnomeTome on ""Converting Vinyl LPs to CD."" Who'd have thought there were so many of you out there that are, well, my age and still in possession of those black slabs of aural heaven. I don't know if Jake's just lost his mind, or what, but free? Get outta here. Go ahead - ""Gnome"" our servers. Get you copy while you can. And while you're there, check out some of the other killer e-tip books in the GnomeTomes collection.Have a great Tuesday.

SPECIAL OFFER for Lockergnome readers,
get your set TODAY, ONLY $29.95!Setting the Home Page in KonquerorKonqueror, while a great browser, has taken a step in the direction of IE. Like IE, Konqueror is really an integrated web and file browser. You can use it equally well to view web pages and files on your system. It's been something of a hot debate whether this is actually the proper use of a browser. In fact, Galeon was written specifically to answer this question - it's a web browser and a web broswer only.Regardless, it can be a bit annoying to punch the Home button on the Konqueror browser and end up in your /home/user directory. Have no fear, though. It's an easy change to make your actual web home page the home page in Konqueror.Open Konqueror and select Settings from the toolbar. Select ""Configure Konqueror,"" and leave the default selection of ""File Manager"" as is. In the text box on the right half of the screen, you'll see a tilde in the ""Home URL"" text box. That just tells Konqueror to use the user's home directory as the home URL. Changing this to a web address will set that address as your home page. Select OK to close the window.Taking it one step further, click on the Home button in your Konqueror browser to open your newly-configured web home page. Then, select ""Window"" and ""Save View Profile, 'Web Browsing.'"" This will futher save the URL and allow your the opportunity to save the window size when the browser opens.Konqueror is more than just a web browser. But, it's not so tough to make it act like a pure web browser if you just know where to look.

Kernel Configuration - Part XIIDepending on who you talk to, RAID can stand for ""Redundant Array of Independent Discs"" or ""Redundant Array of Inexpensive Discs."" No matter. They both point to the same theory and practice in Linux; data storage redundancy. That's today's kernel configuration section - Multi-Device Support.Let's talk first about the principles behind a RAID setup. RAID uses multiple discs for speed, increased data storage, or data redundancy. Fundamentally, there are 5 levels of RAID in Linux; Linear, RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-4, and RAID-5.Linear RAID uses two or more discs, appending data from one to another. In other words, when disc 1 is full, disc 2 steps in to store data. There is no redundancy in Linear RAID - only an increase in storage capacity. Further, there's no marked increase in data access speed because you're accessing one drive in the RAID array at a time.RAID-0 ""stripes"" data across the RAID drives. Some data will be written to the first drive, some to the second, etc. Like Linear RAID, RAID-0 provides no redundancy. Because the data has been written in parallel across the drives, not all data exists on all drives. Lose a drive and your data is gone. RAID-0 will, however, decrease data access time. Your system will run more quickly.RAID-1, unlike Linear and RAID-0, does provide data redundancy. This is the first level in which data is ""mirrored"" across the drives in the RAID array. All data that exists on one drive exists on all the others. RAID-1 requires at least two drives and they should be of equal size, otherwise, your overall RAID array will be the size of the smallest drive. Performance with RAID-1 can actually be slower than with a single drive or RAID-0, as all the data is written across multiple discs.RAID-4 is, for the most part, pretty useless. It reserves one disc for parity information while striping the data across the others. This is much like Linear mode, with an additional disc thrown in for parity data. Parity data can be used to reconstruct and retrieve the data on the other drives, but this really isn't a redundant method of data storage. Consequently, RAID-4 is probably the least used of the RAID schemes.RAID-5 is designed for 3 or more discs and provides both redundancy and speed. Like RAID-4, RAID-5 pays close attention to parity data. However, rather than reserving a device in the RAID array for this data, it's written across the array. Because the parity data is written across the array, data recovery can be accomplished fairly quickly. In fact, using a ""spare disc"" configuration will allow RAID-5 to reconstruct the data to the spare disc immediately after the failure of a drive. Because of it's increased speed and redundancy, RAID-5 is probably the most common setup for multiple storage devices.With all that in mind, you'll need to make a choice in your kernel configuration. Do you have mutliple drives of the same size that you'd like to configure as a RAID array? The Multi-Device Support section of the kernel configuration will allow you to do this. In fact, you'll be able to set the RAID level, as well. Again, evaluate your needs and select the appropriate option.Tomorrow, it's on to networking options in your kernel configuration.

Windows Apps in Linux?
Scribbled by Robert Nix""Nice coverage but I don't give a flip about Office. OpenOffice is fine
for my needs.""What I really want is to run Quicken (at least v.2001) which is the only
app keeping me running Windows (using vmware). I've tried Quicken on Mac
OS X and it is grossly inadequate and on Linux with Wine and have so far
been unsuccessful even using tips from
http://appdb.codeweavers.com/appview.php?appId=107. I hope that GnuCash
will eventually support the online features I enjoy but that doesn't
help now.""The reason I'm writing this is that I personally think Office products
are overrated for home users, at least now that there are several native
alternatives. For home users, finance apps are the key issue now. Do a
section on getting Quicken to run in Wine and I'll declare you a god. :)""

Important Unix Manpages
http://home.ins.de/~m.hussmann/man/Manpages are an important part of Linux use. Armed with the proper knowledge and manpage, there are few sticky situations in Linux that can't be solved quickly. Though they can be a bit cryptic at times, manpages are really a Linux newbie's best friend.Important Unix Manpages is a compilation of help for situations that actually have little to do with programming. They're more human interface problems than machine interface problems. This page just points out that if life was like Linux, we'd all be a lot happier.

"re : 5 . 1225 linguistics and imperialism with regard to hoberman 's comment . it would not make sense to say that linguistics is inherently imperialistic in nature , any more than it would for any other science , since linguistics is multi-faceted and has many purposes , some now well established and others continually evolving , e . g . , "" forensic "" applications of linguistics etc . since language is universal , applications for linguistics are universal . in my earlier comments i dwelt on diversity among languages because that 's where the connection between linguistics ( mainly as an aid to learning and teaching languages ) and multilingual empires ( = "" imperialism "" ) is easiest to see . however , i also noted that there are people who are interested in language and linguistic diversity for its own sake . i suspect that this is universal . although it may be reflected differently in different cultures . maybe the universality of interest in language and linguistic diversity is reflected in myths about the origin of such diversity , or other kinds of "" pre-linguistic "" explanations . among cultures which seem particularly ethnocentric to me , classic athenian culture perhaps was less encouraging to interest in other languages than most cultures ( with the us perhaps close behind but also with a complex fear and insecurity about languages other than english ) . nevertheless , we see from plato 's cratylus that differences between greek ( in its various diachronic forms ) and the "" barbarian "" languages was put to philosophical use . if you read cratylus , you ' ll see that plato , through socrates , was putting some value on philosophical arguments which brought in data from other languages . ( even though there 's a lot of sarcasm and tongue in cheek in the whole issue as plato treats it in cratylus , i . e . , whether the words of language are "" natural "" or "" conventional "" / are there "" correct "" words for ideas / concepts / things ? - - plato is always a polemicist , reacting to rival schools of thought . ) i would like to re-open the issue ( i think it was once opened before on the list ) about how different cultures "" explain "" language diversity , and whether there is a culture which prevents all individual members from being interested in language for its own sake . i do n't think that could logically be possible - - but what do i know ? in any case , this might give us some insights into the "" prehistory of linguistics "" , and also into the still present motivations of some linguists to attach themselves to this aspect of our culture . benji",Safe Email

"that helps. There's still so little info on TES and those of us here since RazorV1 know how it works. I did set my min_cf to ""ac-100"" which I thought would be zero. So the way you are suggesting that it works now is that everyone has a trust level of 1 and have to work their way up. Your trust level increases when someone nominates the same message as spam. This must have been the new changes made at the beginning of the week unless the changes dumped everyone's trust level. Now here come the questions...What engine signature does TES look at? Does it have to be the same e1 signature or does it use the e2 or e4 signatures. How many people have to nominate the message before everyones rating increases? How many revokes decreases someones rating? Does a single revoke decrease the rating of everyone that nominated the message? If a newby reports a message that has already been reported does their trust level immediately go up? In the case of revoking, does someone with a trust level of 1 have the capability to revoke a message submitted by multiple people with higher trust levels? -----Original Message----- From: Vipul Ved Prakash [mailto:mail@vipul.net] Sent: Thursday, August 08, 2002 4:22 AM To: razor-users@example.sourceforge.net Subject: Re: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now? Bobby, Couple of things: If you are not a trusted reporter, your reports will not have an immediate effect. It takes a bunch of trusted reporters to bump up the confidence of a signature to a point where it is considered to be spam. This might be frustrating initially, but as the number of trusted users grows the time delay between nominations and determination will become shorter. Of course, it's a lot more frustating for people to have their legit mail filtered out due to incorrect reporting.Also, for the purpose of testing, I'd suggest making your min_cf (in razor-agents.conf) to 0. min_cf defaults to the server recommended average confidence, which at the moment is 1. Setting min_cf to 0 should return true for whatever you submit (as long as it was not revoked by a trusted user).apt/fire sync with honor every 5 minutes, so you'd have to wait for a _maximum_ of 5 minutes before signatures propagate.cheers, vipul.

"language and species a few posts on the subject have pleased me : i am perhaps not alone in having eccentric beliefs about non-human languages . it had started when i was hoping , after finishing my phd , to work on dolphins ' language ; it had continued when i read , somewhere , that the deaf 's sign language was not a language ( how did those people whom i saw meeting regularly in the pub down the road communicate , then , if they did not have a language ? i often envied them being stone deaf - - cursed with hearing as i am , i dislike noisy pubs and restaurants ) . a that stage , it got me thinking that "" proper "" human language dealt with encoding an n-dimensional conceptual universe into one-dimensional strings ( perhaps with a degenerate dimension extra , if you pay attention to prosodic features ) . that , sign language , on the other hand , encoded it into definitely two dimensions or more - - even though i could not figure out how many , let alone which , having found so little in the literature ( just as anyone doing linguistics should know at least a few foreign languages , perhaps , perhaps they should know at least some sign language , and have practiced it . when i say "" perhaps "" i mean "" definitely "" , of course . "" perhaps "" is a euphemism , a weak excuse for not having taken the time to learn and practice sign language ) . later , about dolphins ' languages , no * cetacean * in this case , i read , somewhere , the circumstances under which orcs had learnt to avoid boats equipped with harpoon guns , which seemed to mean that they must have been "" told "" how to recognize them by the first to meet those boats for the first time . this seemed too efficient . you just try to explain to someone how to recognize a contraption never encountered before . no paper and pencil , just words . misunderstandings galore . that got me thinking about another possible form of communication . cetaceans "" see "" by sonar , like bats . they communicate , we read , by sound , in a very wide range ( a few hertz to 100khz or more if memory serves ) . what if they actually communicated by * projecting * sonar images then ? paintings as it were , along with stylized representations . animated too , that 's quite possible . later again , i tied that in with what some will tell you about the intelligence of birds , how some mynah birds seem to understand a few words and use them in the proper context . the complexity of bird songs . the hopelessness of some schemes dreamt up to find out if animals communicated through language strikes me now . putting birds , or whatever , in different cages or pens , training one set to push the third lever from the left to get food ; see if they communicate their discovery to the those in the other pen . if they communicate by projected sonar image we are looking for the needle in the haystack . by song modulation , ditto . there would be , at any rate , dozens , nay , hundreds of ways of explaining "" push the third lever "" . how would * you * say "" lever "" if you had never had anything like it in your environment ? "" third "" ? "" from the left "" ? so even if they jabbered in a human-like language , one phoneme after the other , we would have a very hard time of spotting their exchange . you know the story about how they said "" piano "" in beach - la - mar : "" big fella box , he got black and white teeth , missus belong white master he fight ' im belong him , box he cry now "" . there 's more than one way to say "" piano "" that way ! i have , then , come to this notion that , when we meet non-human , sentient beings , we probably won't recognize the fact . that those definitions ( and redefinitions ) of language as human language with these and those features , and if it has n't got it then it is n't language , are utterly uninteresting . they would be at best entirely useless , only vacuous tautologies ( is n't that self-referencing ! ) . but in fact they can only be obnoxious , leading to methods incapable of recognizing and analyzing "" non-human "" languages . such as asl ( insert a sarcastic smiley here ) . to conclude on a related theme . i keep reading how the reconstructed vocal tract of neanderthals shows that they could not have a full language , because . . . blah blah ( i really am loath to repeat the argument ) . how about the vocal tract of a parrot , reconstructed from its skeleton ? j . guy @ trl . oz . au",Safe Email

we shall be looking for testimony on the actual effects of professional involvement on small language communities throughout the world : both community members , and the professionals themselves will have their tales to tell . we do not expect a common set of conclusions to emerge from this sharing of experience and analysis . but we shall be looking at the variety we find , and asking if it points to a good way to define the roles of the support organizations : how they can complement one another , perhaps sharing techniques , perhaps transmitting knowledge ? some themes that need to be addressed : when does the professional best act as an external consultant , when as a team-player ? what are useful relations : among grammarians , lexicographers and sociolinguists ? among community-leaders , language-activists and language-scientists ? among ordinary speakers , creative users , broadcasters and publishers ? what have been great successes in specialist language work , and what motivated the people responsible ? how does local work benefit from el support organizations with a global or continental view ? is the need for technical assistance , production of materials , publicity , funding , political agitation ? should el support organizations themselves specialize ? if so how : regionally , or by function ? the dates will be 25-27 september 1998 , and the venue the pollock halls in edinburgh . there will be a preliminary volume of proceedings distributed at the conference . presentations will last twenty minutes each , with a further ten minutes for discussion . all presentations should be accessible largely in english , but use of the languages of interest , for quotation or exemplification , may well be appropriate . organizers : dr nicholas ostler foundation for endangered languages , bath , england prof kenneth mackinnon universities of edinburgh and hertfordshire dr briony williams university of edinburgh , scotland programme committee : akira yamamoto , mahendra k verma , andrew woodfield , anthony woodbury , tasaku tsunoda , jane simpson , mari rhydwen , jon reyhner , nicholas ostler , david nash , christopher moseley , kenneth mackinnon , john clews , margaret allen . abstract submission abstracts should not exceed 500 words . they can be submitted in one of two ways : hard copy or electronic submission . they should be in english . a ) hard copies ( or faxes ) : three copies should be sent to : nicholas ostler foundation for endangered languages batheaston villa , 172 bailbrook lane bath ba1 7aa england this should have a clear short title , but should not bear anything to identify the author ( s ) . on a separate sheet , please include the following information : name : names of the author ( s ) title : title of the paper email : email address of the first author , if any addr : postal address of the first author tel : telephone number of the first author , if any fax : fax number of the first author , if any the name of the first author will be used in all correspondence . if possible , please also send an e-mail to nicholas ostler at < nostler @ chibcha . demon . co . uk > informing him of the hard copy submission . this is in case the hard copy does not reach its destination . this e-mail should contain the information specified in the section below . b ) electronic submission : electronic submission should be in plain ascii text email message giving the following details : # name : name of first author # title : title of the paper # email : e - mail address of the first author # addr : postal address of the first author # tel : telephone number of the first author , if any # fax : fax number of the first author and in a separate section # abstr : abstract of the paper important dates abstract submission deadline march 29 notification of committee 's decision april 27 authors submit camera-ready text july 14 conference sept 25-27 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - nicholas ostler managing director president linguacubun ltd foundation for endangered languages http : / / www . bris . ac . uk / depts / philosophy / ctll / fel / batheaston villa , 172 bailbrook lane bath ba1 7aa england + 44-1225 - 85-2865 fax + 44-1225 - 85-9258 nostler @ chibcha . demon . co . uk",Safe Email

Hi, 
   I am wondering if there are any techniques to make a CD-Key of the like 
unbreakable.  Either by giving it a cancelation date and a periodic renewal 
from a server or just by using self md5 signature on the resulting 
executable.  I know it must not be easy because the whole software piracy 
problem would be resolved but there must be some way to make it really hard 
to break it.  Anyone have hints on this issue ?Thanks- --

"acl workshop on translingual information management acl / coling-98 workshop on translingual information management current levels and future abilities august 16 , 1998 ( following acl / coling-98 ) university of montreal , montreal ( quebec , canada ) call for papers description - - - - - - - - - - the development of natural language applications which handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information is the next major challenge facing the field of computational linguistics . over the past 50 years , a variety of language-related capabilities has been developed in areas such as machine translation , information retrieval , and speech recognition , together with core capabilities such as information extraction , summarization , parsing , generation , multimedia planning and integration , statistics-based methods , ontologies , lexicon construction and lexical representations , and grammar . the next few years will require the extension of these technologies to encompass multi-lingual and multi-modal information . extending current technologies will require integration of the various capabilities into multi-functional natural language systems . however , there is today no clear vision of how these technologies could or should be assembled into a coherent framework . what would be involved in connecting a speech recognition system to an information retrieval engine , and then using machine translation and summarization software to process the retrieved text ? how can traditional parsing and generation be enhanced with statistical techniques ? what would be the effect of carefully crafted lexicons on traditional information retrieval ? this workshop is a follow-on to an nsf - sponsored workshop held in conjunction with the first international conference on language resources and evaluation in granada , spain ( may 1998 ) , at which an international panel of invited experts will consider these questions in an attempt to identify the most effective future directions of computational linguistics research - - especially in the context of the need to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information . the follow-on acl workshop is intended to open the discussion to the computational inguistics community as a whole . the workshop will include ample time for discussion . a report summarizing the discussions at granada will be available before the acl workshop . topics - - - - - the workshop will focus on the following fundamental questions : 1 . what is the current level of capability in each of the major areas of the field dealing with language and related media of human communication ? 2 . how can ( some of ) these functions be integrated in the near future , and what kind of systems will result ? 3 . what are the major considerations for extending these functions to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information , particularly in integrated systems of the type envisioned in ( 2 ) ? in particular , we will consider these questions in relation to the following areas : o multi-lingual resources ( lexicons , ontologies , corpora , etc . ) o information retrieval , especially cross-lingual and cross-modal o machine translation o automated ( cross-lingual ) summarization and information extraction o multimedia communication , in conjunction with text o evaluation and assessment techniques for each of these areas o methods and techniques ( both statistics-based and linguistics - based ) of pre-parsing , parsing , generation , information acquisition , etc . we invite submissions which report on work in these areas . all papers should clearly identify how the work addresses the issues and questions outlined above . submissions - - - - - - - - - - only hard-copy submissions will be accepted . authors should submit six ( 6 ) copies of the full-length paper ( 3500-5000 words ) . submissions should be sent to : nancy ide department of computer science vassar college 124 raymond avenue poughkeepsie , new york 12604-0520 usa style files and templates for preparing submissions can be found at http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / styles . html the official language of the conference is english . important deadlines - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - submission deadline : march 23 , 1998 notification date : may 15 , 1998 camera ready copy due : june 15 , 1998 scientific committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - charles fillmore university of california berkeley , usa robert frederking carnegie mellon university , usa ulrich heid ( tentative ) university of stuttgart , germany eduard hovy information sciences institute , usa nancy ide vassar college , usa lauri karttunen ( tentative ) rank xerox research , france kimmo koskenniemi ( tentative ) university of helsinki , finland mun kew leong national university of singapore joseph mariani limsi / cnrs , france mark maybury the mitre corporation , usa sergei nirenburg ( tentative ) new mexico state university , usa akitoshi okumura ( tentative ) nec , japan martha palmer university of pennsylvania , usa james pustejovsky brandeis university , usa peter schaueble eth , switzerland oliviero stock irst , italy felisa verdejo uned , spain piek vossen university of amsterdam , netherlands wolfgang wahlster dfki , germany organizers - - - - - - - - - robert frederking , carnegie mellon university , usa eduard hovy , isi , university of southern california , usa nancy ide , vassar college , usa information - - - - - - - - - - information on the workshop can be found at http : / / www . cs . vassar . edu / ~ ide / translingual . html inquiries may be addressed to the organizers : robert frederking < ref @ nl . cs . cmu . edu > eduard hovy < hovy @ isi . edu > nancy ide < ide @ cs . vassar . edu >",Safe Email

( ene ) in the past two weeks , the stock is trading at about its book value , begging the question : so how much is it worth anyway ? the answer is far from easy . ever since enron metamorphosed from a stodgy gas pipeline company into what was seen by many as a dynamic energy trading firm , the company has become increasingly more difficult to understand . just a glance at the wide - range of wall street analysts who follow the company illustrates the point . in the mix are analysts who track natural gas and the pipeline industry as well as those who follow electric utilities . one enticing prospect is that the assets in its portfolio are valuable in and of themselves and could be seen by some as worthwhile acquisition targets . by enron ' s own definition , the company houses four main divisions : enron wholesale services , enron energy services , enron transportation services , and enron broadband services . wholesale services houses the company ' s energy marketing business and enrononline . this segment accounts for the bulk of enron ' s profits , and has become synonymous with what enron means to most people today . not only does enron trade gas , oil and coal , but it also trades commodities such as pulp and paper , petrochemicals , lumber , plastics and even weather risk . enron energy services is the company ' s retail arm . the company provides electricity , gas and commodity risk management services through this division . enron transportation services operates four natural gas pipelines that span about 25 , 000 miles and have a peak capacity of 9 . 8 billion cubic feet per day . through these pipelines the company says it transports about 15 % of the natural gas the u . s . needs . the segment also includes portland general , a oregon utility company enron is selling to northwest natural gas co . ( nwn ) for $ 1 . 9 billion in cash and stock . in addition , the company provides bandwidth and network services through its enron broadband services division . but enron ' s reach is even wider than this list suggests . the company also has a number of other corporate investments , including its stake in the azurix water business , enron renewable energy corp . as well as methanol and mtbe plants . through enron ' s unconsolidated affiliates , the company also has investments in additional water assets , a power plant in india and a natural gas pipeline in argentina among other things . what makes any valuation of enron difficult is what remains unknown about the company ' s financial structure . enron has yet to file a balance sheet for the third quarter , and doesn ' t expect to do so until nov . 15 , when balance sheets must be filed under securities and exchange commission regulations . without the balance sheet , some of the details needed for calculating a company ' s value are missing . also , much still remains unknown about the company ' s obligations to its off - balance sheet financing vehicles . using what is known about enron ' s finances , several analysts have arrived at their own conclusions about valuation . merrill lynch 201 - 938 - 5166 ; christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron ' s stock jumps amid takeover speculation by juan . a . lozano associated press writer 10 / 31 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . houston ( ap ) - after plummeting to a nine - year low following recent economic losses and an investigation by federal securities regulators , shares of enron corp . jumped nearly 25 percent wednesday amid speculation the company was ripe for takeover . shares of enron , the nation ' s largest natural gas and power marketer , rose $ 2 . 74 to close at $ 13 . 90 wednesday on the new york stock exchange . shares though are still down 69 percent since the company reported third quarter earnings just over two weeks ago . carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities inc . in houston , said wednesday ' s surge was likely a reaction to a the wall street journal report that enron ' s beaten - down stock price has stirred rumors of a possible takeover . others may be buying figuring the stock has hit bottom , she said . on tuesday , enron ' s stock closed at $ 11 . 16 , its lowest level since 1992 . enron shares began their steady fall in the middle of october , when the company reported a net loss of $ 638 million in the third quarter , taking a one - time charge of $ 1 . 01 billion attributed to investment losses , troubled assets and unit restructurings . some of these losses have been tied to partnerships managed by enron ' s former chief financial officer , andrew fastow , who was ousted last week . the potential conflict of interest has prompted an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . earlier this week , moody ' s investors service downgraded the company ' s long - term debt and warned of possible further downgrades . potential buyers include general electric ' s ge capital unit , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway and royal dutch shell , the journal said . duane grubert , an analyst with sanford c . bernstein and co . in new york , said shell , which has a small presence in energy marketing , would be a good fit . "" shell tried to be in the merchant energy arena and didn ' t really succeed , "" he said . "" to buy into an established franchise must be attractive to shell . "" enron officials did not immediately return telephone calls from the associated press on wednesday . while enron ' s stock price has made it attractive , coale said the energy marketer ' s problems present a substantial drawback . "" i would fault a company for acquiring enron with all of this hanging over it , "" she said . "" there are too many uncertainties . "" grubert said he believes enron has the ability "" to weather the storm and restore their enterprise on their own . "" since reporting its disappointing third quarter losses , enron has been negotiating with banks to establish new credit lines . the company last week decided to cash in about $ 3 billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence . - - - on the net : http : / / www . enron . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : few signs of domino effect among enron ' s peers . by andrew kelly 10 / 31 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . houston , oct 31 ( reuters ) - u . s . energy traders such as dynegy inc . and aquila inc . have taken a knock as a result of enron corp ' s recent woes , but analysts do not expect a broad loss of investor confidence in the sector to trigger massive losses in stock prices like enron has suffered . "" the issues impacting enron are pretty much specific to that company , "" said credit lyonnais securities analyst gordon howald . "" i don ' t believe that a lot of its peers have the same type of potential negative impact , "" he said . enron ' s widespread use of complex off - balance - sheet financing deals and its reluctance to disclose details about them are a key reason why investors have dumped the company ' s stock , causing it to fall more than 60 percent in the last two weeks . and while other natural gas and electricity marketers use similar techniques to avoid overloading their balance sheets with debt , nobody does so to the same extent as enron , analysts said . "" enron is a unique case in the magnitude of off - balance sheet transactions , "" said prudential securities analyst carole coale . uncomfortable with disclosure coale said she was not comfortable with the level of disclosure provided by many of enron ' s peers about such deals , but she said this was less of a problem at other companies because they have less exposure to the risky energy trading and marketing business which contributes about 80 percent of enron ' s profits . el paso corp . , for example is channeling over $ 1 billion in off - balance - sheet financing into its project electron venture which was set up to acquire and manage power plants . analysts say they are reasonably pleased with the information that el paso has provided to them about electron . el paso ' s stock has fallen a relatively modest 5 percent over the last two weeks and analysts attribute this in large part to the fact that marketing and trading operations generate only about one quarter of the company ' s earnings . dynegy ' s stock is down some 17 percent over the last two weeks and analysts said this was linked to dynegy ' s assumption of a leadership role among u . s . energy marketers in many investors ' eyes as enron began to fall out of favor and as dynegy attained a correspondingly high price - earnings ratio . asked about dynegy ' s use of off - balance - sheet financing , spokesman john sousa drew a contrast between his own company and enron , saying dynegy had no financing that was backed by issuance of stock , nor any "" related party transactions "" . former high - fliers shunned analysts said that in the current uncertain investment climate , investors are shunning trading - oriented companies ' whose stocks had previously commanded high price - earnings multiples and seeking out more modestly valued companies which own physical assets such as power plants and natural gas pipelines . in terms of recent stock price performance this trend has punished a marketer - trader like aquila , whose shares are down 27 percent over the last two weeks . on the other hand it has been relatively kind to companies such as williams cos . and duke energy corp . , which until recently were treated with scorn by enron executives who aggressively propounded an "" asset - light "" philosophy . williams ' stock has fallen about 5 percent over the last fortnight while duke ' s shares are down less than 1 percent and have outperformed the broader u . s . stock market . j . p . morgan analyst anatol feygin said enron had fallen victim to its unique taste for sophisticated financing techniques and its failure to explain them when doubts started to surface . "" enron took it to an extreme in terms of financial engineering , but it didn ' t disclose enough information about what is behind all of these structures , "" he said . credit lyonnais securities ' howald had a simpler explanation , saying that as the euphoria which surrounded enron last year subsided , people began to see enron for what it was . "" trading companies have always had a history of winning big and losing big , "" he said .

' ' myers joined the company in november 1999 as it struggled to track costs from acquisitions . he has put new financial - systems software in place and made other efforts to cut costs . the company has also raised prices where it ' s the dominant hauler . myers ' s efforts , along with the sale of overseas businesses , have helped the company regain regard among investors . the shares have risen 22 percent in the past year . pulp and paper most of waste management ' s solid - waste customers produce or consume pulp and paper . waste management collects , processes and sells more than five million tons a year of paper , plastic , glass , aluminum and other metals . recycled - cardboard prices fell 62 percent to $ 48 a ton in the second quarter from $ 125 a year earlier , and the price for recycled newsprint fell to $ 55 a ton from $ 90 , myers said in august . prices were little changed from the second quarter to the third quarter , said steve ragiel , waste management ' s vice president of recycling . waste management , which will report third - quarter results next week , had expected to begin trading in the third quarter . its plans were delayed because it took longer than expected to find people to run the operation , raigel said . jeff harbert , formerly of enron corp . , is heading the operation along with two other enron traders . enron , also based in houston , has created the largest business of trading commodities including electricity , natural gas , pulp and paper . risk management waste management ' s initial focus in the trading business will be on managing its own price risk . it probably only will complete five to 10 trades in each of the first few months , raigel said . the company hopes to set fixed prices for the commodities it picks up , then sell those commodities to a third company , such as a paper producer , at a higher set price . ` ` we ' ll get with a counter party such as a paper mill or a consumer - products company and cut a deal , ' ' raigel said . ` ` we can find a paper mill that wants to lock in a fixed price on what they buy and what they sell . they get a minimum return on their investment and greater control on their raw material costs . ' ' the company hasn ' t said how much it expects to make from trading . analysts aren ' t expecting the business to contribute significantly to waste management ' s earnings . ` ` they are looking at it as a good time to get in on trading but i don ' t see it as a major contributor to their business , ' ' said stewart scharf , an analyst with standard & poor ' s equity group . he rates waste management ` ` accumulate ' ' and doesn ' t own shares . republic services group inc . , the no . 3 u . s . waste company , contracts with individual mills to supply recycled commodities at fixed prices , but hasn ' t started a trading operation , spokesman will flower said . allied waste industries inc . , the second - largest trash hauler in north america , said it has no plans to get into trading . ` ` we ' ll leave trading to people like enron , ' ' allied waste spokesman michael burnett said . - - mark johnson in the princeton newsroom ( 609 ) 750 - 4662 enron ends 10 - day skid with 25 % jump lisa sanders cbsmarketwatch . com october 31 , 2001 houston ( cbs . mw ) - - shares of enron , which had lost about 66 percent of their value over the past 10 sessions , spiked wednesday after a report that pegged the beleaguered company as a takeover target . enron added 25 percent , or $ 2 . 74 , to close at $ 13 . 90 . more than 43 million shares changed hands , making the stock the most actively traded on the new york stock exchange . a . g . edwards ' analyst michael heim warned wednesday against buying enron shares . he noted that enron ' s troubles could be hurting its trading operations , the company ' s strength .

' s press release about its third - quarter results included this statement , attributed to louis gerstner , chairman and chief executive officer : ` ` ibm ' s balance sheet remains among the strongest in the technology industry , or any industry . ' ' the largest maker of computers and provider of computer services wasn ' t the only company to cite its balance sheet , a statistical summary of what a company owned , what it owed , and what was left over for shareholders on a specific date . general electric co . , the largest company by stock market value , and citigroup inc . , the no . 1 financial - services company , made similar references in their third - quarter releases . none of the companies really showed people what they were telling them . ibm , general electric and citigroup are among 19 members of the dow jones industrial average whose most recent quarterly releases didn ' t include balance sheets . the evidence will come only when the companies submit their quarterly reports to the u . s . securities and exchange commission . balance sheets are required in the so - called 10 - q filings , along with the 10 - k filings that cover the full year . not much publicity by then , statistics about the companies ' assets , liabilities and shareholders ' equity , the accounting terms for what ' s owned , what ' s owed and what ' s left over , will be rather outdated . u . s . companies have 45 days from the end of a fiscal quarter to submit 10 - q reports , and 90 days from the end of a fiscal year for 10 - k reports . these filings usually don ' t arrive until weeks after the publication of earnings releases . so it ' s easy to overlook the additional information they provide , especially when it doesn ' t receive the kind of publicity that the earnings release does . yet the recent example of enron corp . - - another company that omits balance sheets from press releases - - provides evidence that investors who forgo the extra effort needed to find them do so at their own peril . enron , the largest energy trader , reported $ 1 . 01 billion in ` ` non - recurring ' ' costs in the third quarter from an expansion into water , telecommunications and retail - energy sales . the expense contributed to a $ 618 million loss for the quarter . these numbers were part of the houston - based company ' s income statement , a summary of sales , costs and expenses , and profits or losses during a specified time period . income statements are the cornerstone of any company ' s earnings release . billion - dollar numbers the release didn ' t even mention a larger figure that affected the balance sheet : a $ 1 . 2 billion drop in shareholders ' equity during the quarter resulting from the company ' s repurchase of 55 million shares from two partnerships , ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , that helped finance projects . andrew fastow , who ran both partnerships , was ousted from his job as chief financial officer last week . chairman and ceo kenneth lay disclosed the repurchase in a subsequent conference call . such a one - two punch dealt a blow to investors ' fortunes . since oct . 17 , the day after the earnings release , enron ' s shares have fallen each day and have lost two - thirds of their value . the low of $ 10 . 90 yesterday was the lowest price since july 1992 . enron ' s third - quarter statement referred only to a loss on ` ` finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity ' ' which contributed to $ 544 million of investment losses . the size of that item was later put at $ 35 million . the latter number amounts to just 3 . 5 percent of the overall figure for ` ` non - recurring ' ' costs , and less than 1 percent of the company ' s $ 47 . 6 billion in revenue for the quarter . growing debt burden the $ 1 . 2 billion figure is considerably larger not only in dollars , but also in percentage terms . enron had $ 11 . 74 billion of shareholders ' equity as of june 30 , according to the balance sheet in its second - quarter 10 - q filing . the reduction equaled more than 10 percent of that total . among other things , the balance sheet also shows that the company relied more heavily on debt financing during this year ' s first half . short - term debt , due in one year or less , doubled to $ 3 . 46 billion . long - term debt , maturing in more than one year , rose 9 . 4 percent to $ 9 . 36 billion . there ' s even more to the story of enron ' s indebtedness . the company guaranteed $ 3 . 3 billion in borrowing by osprey trust and marlin water trust , which bought some of its power plants . unless they pay off the debt by reselling the plants , the company may have to come up with the difference . nevertheless , any summary of a company ' s financial position provides a more complete picture than the income statement alone . this also holds true for companies whose finances are in better shape -

"This is due to insufficient write privileges to the ""razor-agent.log"" 
file. A quick work-around is to do a ""chmod go+rx"" on that file (of 
course, it's better to restrict the access as much as possible).In Agent.pm, when the Razor2::Logger object is created, if it doesn't 
have write permission to the log file it does not succeed. Then, later 
in the code when the log object is used, it fails with the ""unblessed"" 
error.Hope this helps,

Date: Not suppliedJakob Nielsen on Offshore Usability[1]: ""To save costs, some companies are 
outsourcing Web projects to countries with cheap labor. Unfortunately, these 
countries lack strong usability traditions and their developers have limited 
access -- if any -- to good usability data from the target users."" Offshore usability is a specific case of the general ""offshore design"" problem. 
Put simply, software teams are not successful when 
design or management are done in a different physical location than 
programming. Once I actually had a job where I was in New York, my direct 
manager was in Singapore, _his_ manager was in Hyderabad, and if I needed 
any management input I had literally no choice but to go to the CEO because at 
least he was awake during the same hours as I was. You can't get things done 
like this. A good project team relies on hundreds of small interactions a day. 
Here in the Fog Creek offices, we have 10 small conversations about FogBUGZ 3.0 
development every day. What I don't understand is people who think it's OK to move the developers ten 
time zones away from their managers and expect good results. Those same people 
would scream bloody murder if you told them that you were going to 
send the whole _management_ team to Bangalore or Beijing.[1] http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20020916.html

"Folks,
 
my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux. 
Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.
 
I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?
 
Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.
 
If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.
 
Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat? Opinions
welcome.
 
Thanks a lot,
Peter--

Tech shores up Homeland DefenseComputer security is becoming an increasingly critical part of President Bush's 
proposal for a homeland defense department. When Bush formally proposed the department 
last month, he never mentioned the Internet or cybersecurity. But as Capitol Hill 
scrutinizes the proposal, politicians are fretting about tech-savvy terrorists--and 
insisting any new agency must shield the U.S. from electronic attacks as well.

etc)

"sum : size adjs and quantifiers about a month ago , i posted the following query : i ' m looking for examples , from any language , of quantifiers that are formally related to size adjectives . so far , i am familiar with the following three examples : english : little > a little lao : nohy5 > nohy5 neu : ng2 little little one "" little "" "" a little "" minangkabau : ketek > saketek little one-little "" little "" "" a little "" is anybody familiar with more such examples ? in spite of the typological and geographical diversity of these three languages , the above constructions are strikingly similar . this raises the following further questions : ( 1 ) are there any analogous examples where "" many "" is derived from "" big "" ? ( 2 ) are there any examples where the derivation is in the other direction , ie . where a size adjective , eg . "" little "" is derived from a quantifier , eg . "" a few "" ? * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the above query triggered numerous interesting responses , for which i am grateful to the following residents of the global virtual village : robert beard , steven berbeco , jonathan david bobaljik , john cowan , jane edwards , f . gladney , arthur holmer , knut lambrecht , pierre larrivee , ann lindvall , edith moravcsik , geoffrey s . nathan , chris pountain , ines shaw , nancy stenson , frits stuurman , cynthia vakareliyska , 0ystein alexander vangsnes , peansiri vongvipanond , and a person who wished to remain anonymous . in a nutshell , all of the responses but one provided data from european languages . i do not know enough to say whether this areal patterning is of the phenomenon in question , or rather of the respondents to the query , and the languages that they are familiar with . however , the data suggested that formal relationships between quantifiers and size adjectives are indeed widespread , and provided an affirmative answer to the first specific query , with examples of the derivation of "" many "" from "" big "" . in what follows , i provide a selection of typical responses ( if anybody wants the responses in their entirety , they can contact me directly ) . some more examples of "" little "" > "" a little "" : swedish : liten > lite "" little "" "" a little "" irish : beag > beaga ' n "" little "" "" a little "" french : petit > un petit "" little "" "" a little "" russian : mal / malo / mala > malo "" little "" "" a little "" ( short predicate forms ) polish : maly > malo "" little "" "" a little "" bulgarian : maluk / malko / malka > malko "" little "" "" a little "" some respondents offered interesting diachronic comments : "" [ t ] he latin adjectives for ' little ' , parvus and paulus , were replaced by what is often seen as an ' onomatopoeic ' creation ( * pittinnus for spanish ) . the adverb parum , which is morphologically related to parvus is replaced by a form * paucu , which existed in classical latin only in the plural ( pauci ) with the meaning ' ( a ) few ' . in the medieval romance languages , old spanish _ poco _ , old catalan _ poc _ and old occitan _ pauc _ are however attested in the meaning of ' little ' . "" [ chris pountain ] "" [ t ] he latin root is from ie * pou / pau , which gives english few , foal , as well as latin ( and english ) pauper , poverty , not to mention greek paed ` child ' ( paediatrician etc . ) so all the ` small ' and ` few ' meanings are intermingled throughout all the ie etyma . "" [ geoffrey s . nathan ] and now , in response to question ( 1 ) , some examples of "" big "" > "" many "" : quebec french : gros > gros gros "" big "" "" a lot "" irish : mo ' r > mo ' ra ' n "" big "" "" a lot "" ( negative polarity ) polish : duzy > duzo "" big "" "" a lot "" and a general diachronic comment : "" slavic _ comparative _ quantifier "" more "" has the same root ( bol - ) as adj "" big "" ( old church slavonic bolii , modern russian bol 's hoj ) . "" many / much "" is mnogo / mnogi in the slavic languages , root * minog - ( short i ) - - there 's no etymologically related adj meaning "" big "" . ( the root in the comparative shows up as * bolj - in the comparative quantifier and adjs , but i am assuming the j is a suffix [ . . . ] . i think russian is the only modern language where this root still shows up in the adj . "" big "" , though all of them except modern bulgarian ( and probably macedonian ) still have the comparative quantifier in bol . vasmer 's etymological dictionary of the russian language relates the root to sanskrit baliyan ( acute accent on first a , long mark over i and second a ) , "" stronger "" , balisthas ( acute over first a , dot under first s and t ) , "" strongest "" , "" balam "" ( acute over first a ) "" strength "" . russian has two different comparative forms with this root in addition to the adj "" big "" ( bol 's hoj ) : comparative quantifier bol 's he ( as in "" more money "" ) and adverb bolee ( as in "" more interesting "" ) . "" [ cynthia vakareliyska ] as for question ( 2 ) , pertaining to derivations in the opposite direction ( from quantifier to size adjective ) , here the evidence is still less clear . one respondent [ ann lindvall ] suggested some possible examples from swedish and greek . in fact , in the above slavic examples , the directionality is not immediately clear , and may perhaps be most appropriately characterized as a nondirectional identity of ( neuter-form ) adjective and quantifier . however , i still have n't encountered any uncontroversial examples of size adjectives that are derived from quantifiers . finally , two interesting comments on related phenomena : "" hungarian : ' a little ' or 's omewhat ' ( such as in "" she is a little late . "" or "" a somewhat over-ripe pear was lying on the table . "" ) : _ kicsit _ , which consists of _ kicsi _ ( predicative form of the the adjective for 's mall ' ) plus _ t _ , the accusative marker ' very ' , ' extremely ' ( such as in the above sentences , with "" little "" / "" somewhat "" replaced with "" very "" / "" extremely "" ) : _ nagyon _ , which consists of _ nagy _ ' big ' and _ on _ , a de - adjectival adverbializer . these are ad-verbal and ad-adjectival quantifiers . adnominal quantifiers such as ' many ' and ' few ' do not have to do with size adjectives . "" [ edith moravcsik ] "" i suspect that the thai and lao adverb ( ? ) nak "" great deal , a lot "" and the adjective nak "" heavy "" are derivatives of one another ( strange ? ) through grammaticalization . this verbal quantifier is more prevalent in lao , lanna thai dialect and isan dialect ( all geographically and historically related ) than in bangkok thai .

software is not a product which is sold but a service which is licensed - at
least that's what I remember reading about how M$ gets away with providing
no guarantee in the U.S. If you're feeling rather deep pocketed, you could
always try suing M$ to get a court's view on the matter.

simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level e-mail order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is christopher erickson . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incured many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happend in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1995 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not . "" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that "" you must receive 15-20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! "" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20-90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , "" you must receive 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal "" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attatched program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15-20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20-90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the orginator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successfull for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happend to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . by the spring we wish to market the "" internet "" by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing and obtaining e-mail lists . instructions : we at erris mail order marketing businesses , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % everytime . i am sure that you could use $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20-90 days . before you say "" bull . . . "" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four ( 4 ) reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four ( 4 ) names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) to the person listed for the specific report . international orders should also include $ 1 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering it from . you will need all four ( 4 ) reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with your 's , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and the address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! ! ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the requested changes in the name list , save it as text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever e-mail program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk e-mailing and acquiring e-mail lists . step ( 4 ) e - mail a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , e-mail to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get e-mail addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in e-mail mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four ( 4 ) reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports : * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 "" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales "" order report # 1 from : kathy smith 5312 s . e . 30 ave ocala , fl 34480-7524 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 "" major corporations and multi-level sales "" order report # 2 from : micro info publishing inc . 2107 w . commonwealth ave . dept . 264 alhambra , ca 91803 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 "" sources for the best mailing lists "" order report # 3 from : som co . 2168 s . atlantic blvd . # 101 monterey park , ca 91754 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 "" evaluating multi-level sales plans "" order report # 4 from : kal inc . p . o . box 2433 glenview , il . 60025-2433 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion : i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20-90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . no longer will a lack of money hold you back . however , very few people reach financial independence , because when opportunity knocks , they choose to ignore it . it is much easier to say "" no "" than "" yes "" , and this the question that you must answer . will you ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it ? if you do nothing , you have indeed missed something and nothing will change . please re-read this material , this is a special opportunity . if you have any questions , please feel free to write to the sender of this information . you will get a prompt and informative reply . my method is simple . i sell thousands of people a product for $ 5 that cost me pennies to produce and e-mail . i should also point out that this program is legal and everyone who participates will make money . this is not a chain letter or a pyramid scam . at times you probably received chain letters , asking you to send money , on faith , but getting nothing in return , no product what-so - ever ! not only are chain lettters illegal , but the risk of someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive . you are offering a legitimate product to your people . after they purchase the product from you , they reproduce more and resell them . it 's simple free enterprise . as you learned from the enclosed material , the product is a series of four ( 4 ) financial and business reports . the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding , but will be useful to you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead . you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports , which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program . the concise one and two page reports you will be buying can easily be reproduced at a local copy center for a cost of about 3 cents a copy . best wishes with the program and good luck !",Phishing Email

"optimal artificial languages ( humour ) there has been a bit ( wee ) of discussion on this on sci . lang and , well , i could not resist the temptation . here is my contribution to the topic : > from jbm @ newsserver . trl . oz . au ( jacques guy ) date 27 jan 1995 15 : 29 : 06 + 1100 newsgroups sci . lang subject re : optimal artificial languages language being for communication ( not necessarily of truths , mark my words ) , an optimal artificial language should be designed so that its messages survive unscathed through the worst static . ergo , we want * maximal phonetic differentiation * ( tm ) of the vowels , we pick those maximally distant : a , i , u . of the consonants , ditto : a dental , a labial , a velar . having picked the most differentiated points of articulation we must also pick the most deifferentiated manners thereof . fricative , nasal , stop should do nicely . and let us use voicing to help along . that leaves us with * three maximally distant consonants * , which are : m , z , k . so far , so good . but we can do better still . let each consonant be associated with one , and only one , vowel , so that , if either consonant or vowel manages to get mangled in the transmission , you can restitute one from the other . naturally , we would match vowels and consonants to ensure least articulatory effort , lest speakers , tired by too much tongue and lip shifting , start slurring their words . there are n't two ways about it : i goes with z , u with m , a with k . so there we have it , the perfect language for noise-free communication . it 's cv , no consonant clusters , no diphthongs , and each syllable starts with exactly one consonant and has only one vowel . if the consonant is z the vowel is i , and so on ( how lazy can one get ! the list of possibilities is short indeed , yet i wrote "" and so on "" ) . ergo , it has only three possible syllables : zi , ka , mu , thereby being some 130 times easier than chinese ( with its 400 + possible syllables ) . and consider this sample vocabulary ( i leave the meanings to your imagination ) : zizi kaka mumu zizimu kakamu infants will learn it easily ! consider all its advantages : your children will speak fluently before they are two ! one of the first , because shortest , words they will learn will be . . . . . muzika ! thus ensuring the earliest possible development of their musical aptitude ! promote zikamu ( tm ) , the international language of to-morrow ! nb it has come to our attention that a renegade splinter group of the original zikamu ( tm ) movement is peddling a pale imitation of zikamu ( tm ) under the plagiarized name "" kazimu "" . do not be deceived ! the study and practice of their inferior product may cause brain damage ! insist on learning the one and only zikamu ( tm ) . join the official , approved zikamu foundation ( tm ) to day !

Our last pick 
Symphony Telecom (OTCBB: SYPY) went UP 100% in just one week!!!
InDigiNet Identifies 
Acquisition Targets with Combined Revenues of $35 Million...
Â 
Telecom Consolidation Begins to Accelerate The Wall Street Bulletin believes 
that the recent 
investment of capital into Level 3, lead by Warren Buffett, 
is further proof of the continued validity of the telecommunication 
market when looked at from the perspective of the small to mid-sized 
enterprises. After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some 
carriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, 
the future may be dim. But for those survivors of the industry 
that have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems 
mean opportunity. ""Every major industry in the history of 
the United States has experienced a similar transformation, from 
the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the mid-1900s 
to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,"" says Robert 
Saunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market 
research firm. Christopher 
Dean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says ""We are seeing all 
the people that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money 
and for the surviving carriers out there, they can get what used 
to cost a few billion for a few millions."" Read the full 
story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the link at the end 
of this newsletter. 
As we write this report, our New Recommendation 
InDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: 
IGTT) has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since 
late May of 2002. As InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its 
business plan, we believe this company will help lead the way 
up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector. This could be our 
strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our Highest 
Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.
Â 
Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous 
Growth Potential 
We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not 
greater than its competition. A similar telecommunications company, 
Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK), share 
price began to explode in April of this year moving from just 
over $0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America 
Holdings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but 
today has a market cap of $267 million.
IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. 
Using the TALK model for potential growth, IGTT could very well 
be trading in the .60 range in only a few months, with a market 
cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an increase of 1000%. 
So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time is right 
 for investors to get in on the ground floor.
Â 
The InDigNet Strategy
InDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company 
that provides small to mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated 
communication solution. InDigiNet is a prestigious ""Diamond"" 
level partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for Cisco and 
Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and 
wireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the 
Company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the 
capital burden of building a communication network. The Companyâ€™s 
strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single market 
communication companies and attractively priced Internet 
Service Providers (ISPs). The Company recently completed 
its acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect. 
InDigiNet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow 
revenue and enhance profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion 
in commercial telephony, data services and technology spending, 
or 33% of the countryâ€™s total market, and this spending 
is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years.

Â 
The IT Market
Based on recent studies, the countryâ€™s 7.4 
million SMEs currently lag significantly in the utilization of 
IT and data 
communications, including Internet access, web services, business 
software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT spending increased to $981 
billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7 percent over 
2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market researcher 
IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights, 
growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for 
the first time. In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 
2002 and 2003, IT spending in the US is expected to increase by 
3 percent this year over 2001 to $436 billion, with further growth 
of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect growth of 4 percent 
in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will experience flat 
growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market will 
return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown 
in China, India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa 
and Poland. Source: IDC
Â 
Particulars
The Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our 
Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth recommendation list for the following 
reasons:
1. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer 
bases of smaller, single-market communication companies and attractively 
priced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell 
its bundled service package to the acquired customer base that 
will form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all 
types of communication services - local, long distance, wireless, 
and data. 2. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front 
Range communities but in particular the education vertical market 
has recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data 
network into the existing campus network. The Company's customers 
include United States Olympic Committee 
(USOC), University of Denver, 
and Colorado State University. 
3. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues 
to acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy 
court and smaller communication providers with valuable customer 
bases. Each of the targeted companies are within the Company's 
footprint and will, subject to purchase completion, increase the 
Company's embedded customer base. 
Â 
Investment Consideration
InDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the 
three months ended March 31, 2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 
in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1 2001. At this current growth 
rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for their first 
year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more 
and more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors 
will turn to small to mid-sized companies with their investment 
dollars.

collins : well , any time that a company goes through a short term period of troubles , the industry surrounding that , that has an intricate layer of credit relationships , is concerned about their ability to be paid . haffenreffer : but for people who don ` t know what enron does , what role do they play in the trading of natural gas futures ? collins : well , they are a major counter - party in the natural gas industry in trading , selling and distributing natural gas . and so , they have an extensive network of credit relationship with virtually every natural gas company in the north american industry . haffenreffer : are they involved , in some way , with almost every trade having to do with natural gas ? are they that big ? collins : no . i wouldn ` t say that they ` re involved with every trade . they ` re involved in a substantial amount of trading through their electronic market making system . but , no , they ` re only a component of the market , and only do , perhaps , a percentage of what trades on the nymex . haffenreffer : so when trading takes place , and it ` s very fast , there ` s a lot of money changing hands all the time . there ` s a lot of credit given to people trading and when a company like enron has got some liquidity problems , or just even fears of liquidity problems , that can affect people who do trades with them . collins : yes . absolutely . it can cause people to retract from trading . it can cause disruptions in the natural flow of trading . it ` s not unlike the financial markets at all . when you have a serious credit concern . haffenreffer : as result , the nymex is working at a faster clip to get a clearing service set up . is that right ? and explain what role will that have in easing people ` s fears . collins : well , last night , the board approved offering a new service called over - the - counter clearing . we ` re extending it initially on our primary natural gas contract , the henry hub natural gas futures . what that does is allow counter - parties that perhaps may question each other ` s credit worthiness to place the trade on the exchange clearing mechanism . that ` s a network of 50 financial institutions and has aa credit standard . haffenreffer : real quick . it ` s been about a month and a half since september 11 th . collins : yes . haffenreffer : are things back to normal ?

"" we have to wait for the reaction of the four companies to see if they will change their accounting system so that they do not hinder other competitiors , "" cartel office spokesman stefan siebert told reuters . "" if they don ' t do that , then ultimately we could issue an injunction to force them to do so . "" the competition authority said earlier in a statement it had received complaints that grid operators bewag ( bklg . de , enbw , hew and veag that the four firms "" charge their competitors unreasonable and partly fictitious costs "" for balancing energy . german grid operators have sole control over the purchase and sale of such power in their grid areas , which they control by temporarily switching on and off their power plants . this poses a potential threat to other power suppliers . "" new entrants to the german market , such as london ' s enron capital & resources and hamburg ' s lichtblick , because of their small customer portfolios , cannot balance unplanned amounts of power withdrawn as well as the big utilitiy groups can , "" the statement said . "" consequently they have a greater need for balancing energy ( and ) are threatened with the considerable burden of unreasonable prices for it . "" the four utilities have argued that the accounting system they use for balancing energy corresponds to guidelines in the country ' s association agreement ( vv 2 ) , which is due to be modified by next year . "" illegal cartel conduct cannot be justified through the association agreement , "" said cartel office president ulf boege in the statement .

"two seperate projects this weekend.  first mod_gzip which is an apache
module to speed up serving static and dynamic mime(text/.*) web content.
the second is the compaq smart array configs for linux.before i go on much more i'll cover the following bits: the server
is running redhat 7.3 linux with all the updates on a compaq dl380.
the client is running the same on a compaq laptop.  pretty much everything
is stock redhat 7.3 - and i'm consciously trying to stick to that.------------------------------------------------------------------------
mod_gzip:
    
    there's a tutorial on linux.ie for it (thanks donnacha) but since i'm
    not an apache person this only got me part of the way.  step by step,
    this is what i did:	# cd /root
	# wget http://www.remotecommunications.com/apache/mod_gzip/src/1.3.19.1a/mod_gzip.c.gz
	# gunzip mod_gzip.c.gz
	# apxs -ic mod_gzip.c
    
    that should compile and install fine, so add the following to
    your apache configs.  i've included comments to explain where they
    should go.  my apache config is split among many files (which is
    why i didn't use the -a flag to apxs).	# put this after the last LoadModule line
	LoadModule gzip_module        /usr/lib/apache/mod_gzip.so
	# put this after the last LoadModule line
	AddModule mod_gzip.c
	# this just needs to go below the obove two lines.

compaq smart array config:   (WARNING: YOU NEED A JVM FOR YOUR BROWSER)    i searched on google for ""compaq smart array configuration linux"" and
    got a slew of hits.  one of them was a click away from this page:	http://www.compaq.com/support/files/server/us/download/14703.html    i downloaded the rpm.  installed it. and ran the server per the
    instructions.  note, the -R enables remote connections.  if you're
    running the browser locally, run it without the -R and connect
    to localhost.	cpqacuxe -R    i found that galeon didn't work.  mozilla did.  i suspect it's because
    pop-ups are disabled in galeon config, but i might be wrong.  it uses
    java which is slow and memory hungry on this laptop.  feel free to
    try galeon with pop-ups enabled if you want to.    so, point mozilla at http://yourserver:2301/ .  login as
    administrator/administrator and change your password.  then go back
    to the main page and click the little drive array graphic towards
    the bottom.  configure your array as you want (i had to add a disk).
    save your changes, and exit.  to stop the server, just do this:	cpqacuxe -stop    in my case the drive was now accessible.  i started the process of
    making the file systems by partitioning the drive.  i knew what
    it would be called, but a grep for ida on the output of dmesg
    confirmed it.	fdisk /dev/ida/c0d1    and from there i built the filesystems and so on.hope this helps some folks,kevin--

that in a lptp combined with a 6310i with the blootooth (with HSCSD) 
might be a nice thing to have (if they work!)
i'm doin up a little doc, so if anyone is interested i'll post my findings.cheers!mit bestem,Bernardino

"The RIAA continues to amaze me.    Everyone might want to grok the
news yahoo has:http://rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/nm/tc_nm/inlinks/*http://Listen4ever.com
And if you're really bored, go ahead and read the papers that were
filed by the RIAA against the major backbone providers.http://www.riaa.com/pdf/Listen4Ever.pdf
So it looks like the RIAA is getting bored with its usual tack of
suing the peer-to-peer services, and is instead using the DMCA
to sue ISPs and backbones into compliance --  They want said backbones
to block the ip address of the listen4ever.com server due to
listen4ever's alleged infringement of copyright.  To quote
the Motion that the RIAA issued:  ""Plaintiffs request that
the Court issue a preliminary injunction requiring Defendants to block
communication to and from Listen4ever's servers that travel through
Defendants' backbone routing systems"".At least according to the RIAA (probably for bonus terror tactics )
the Listen4ever site is even more formidable than that bane of p2p
goodness, Napster, due to the fact that its on a centralized server,
out of their reach of RIAA/DMCA control (its located in China), and
because according to the RIAA it facilitates the downloading of entire albums.
Apparently listen4ever has a few other sites floating around, and the RIAA has been
unsuccessful in getting any of them to voluntarily surrender
service(1).Gotta love the RIAA for jumping into this lawsuit with the customer's
interests in mind.  How lawyers can write drivel along the lines of
'if you dont stop these guys, we'll run out of money and we won't be
able to supply you new music!' just blows my mind, especially in this
day and age.   The RIAA has enough money to file inane lawsuits
against backbone providers, but they don't have enough money to
produce new artists?  Something seems wrong here.Here's my problem.  Say the RIAA wins in court, and the backbone
providers comply.   Their biggest hurdle is now accomplished, and one
hell of a terrible precident is/can be set.   At least in the RIAA's
case, I'm sure once they get a Court-mandated Ok for this particular
site, they'll just go ahead, write their nice friendly lawyer letters,
and demand that subsequent IP addresses also be blocked, as they too
route to sites that are problematic to the RIAA.Even worse, the concept that other groups (the first that flashed into
my little brain being the Scientologists) also decide that this is the way
to go.   If the RIAA prevails, they have record set, albiet in NY
only, that can be pointed back to, and used in other cases.
Eventually this will hit a large enough court that precident will set,
 and we have a very quiet, very non-reported event occuring from then
 on, the systematic C&Ding of the Internet.   Anything that violates the
DMCA, given its takedown provisions, might now potentially
fall prey to a Cease & Desist letter.  Rather than appealing, the
backbone providers will just agree -- as they seem likely to do
'provided a court order'.Point being is that soon this won't take a court order.  A nastygram
will suffice and we'll wonder where all the new
music/information/dissenting opinions/ criticisms went.This is a scary road we're running down here.   So nice to see that
its still hush-hush in the geek community.Whats more bizzare is some of the support(?) that the RIAA seemed to
get.   I'm curious for instance, how Dave Farber got dragged into
this...  (2) Dave, you still read FoRK?(1) Save for one, lmp3.com, which was listed as a redirect site in the
court documents, has since gone down.   Their website has a humorous little note:  ""Lmp3
will be closed and will never come back! "".  Listen4ever.com is not
responding, but i'm not quite sure if thats due to backbone compliance
or the site being overburdened.(2) Declaration of Prof. David J. Farber:

  |  the issue here is tar(1) (and cpio(1)) archives always
  |  contain the data for each name of a hard link.  [ ... ] ARRGGGHHHH!!!!!
 profuse apologies, the wrong version of my reply was posted
 (blame it on being late for the pub).  ;-( the above is almost pure B*S* --- I got my `tar's and `cpio's
 confused.  what I said _is_ correct, but for cpio(1) archives;
 tar(1) archives do _not_ replicate the data for hard links. I spotted this confusion on my part before I posted my reply,
 and re-wrote it to be more correct, yet somehow the wrong
 version got sent anyways.  ARRGGGHHHH!!!!!  ;-(  ;-(  ;-( anyways, GNU `cpio -p' does not do spurious reads or writes.
 GNU `tar cf - ... | tar xf - ...' also does not, albeit each
 `tar' both reads and writes the data.  hence, there is twice
 (not thrice!) the I/O of `cpio -p', maybe an issue for c.60Gb. using strace(1), I've verified my claim GNU `cpio -p' does
 not do spurious reads or writes, i.e. it link(2)s.  but having
 just come back from the pub, perhaps this should also be taken
 with extra skepticism ......   ;-\ sorry.  cheers!

that ""most rich people are smart"" and that the latter is causal to 
the former.  By implication, then, you would say that ""most poor 
people are stupid"".  This is true, statistically, because most 
people are poor and most people are also stupid.  However there's 
nothing to indicate a causal link there.  So being smart isn't the 
only mechanical requirement to eternal wealth because, obviously, 
most of the members of this list would be rich.Being smart, for example, has made Stephen Hawking famous and 
respected, but he's not particularly rich.  Jennifer Lopez is by 
all accounts a complete moron.  In fact, spend a weekend in Beverly 
Hills and you will encounter vast numbers of people who are 
profoundly stupid driving Rolls Royces and shopping at PRADA.The working class IS the market and the working class IS where 
wealth is created.  The working class makes long-distance calls, 
buys food processors and computers and clothes, and attaches the 
value to goods which allows them to be commodified.  The working 
class saves money, buys Retirement Savings Plans, and invests in 
mutual funds which increases the flow of capital through the 
investment funnel.The economic system of the first world is designed to strike a 
delicate balance between incentivizing the ruling class to support 
wealth-expanding through technological innovation or the 
development of new markets.  At the 100,000 foot level, recessions 
and depressions are created when more wealth is sucked from the 
whirlpool than can be supported by the working class through 
investment and consumption.And the people draining the hot tub are the folks in the ruling 
class -- people like Ken Lay, Dick Cheney, Bernie Ebbers, et al -- 
and they simply got too greedy and caused a bubble in the 
hydraulics that increased the pressure for a time, but ultimately 
wasn't sustainable.And the money that was lost did not come from the ruling class.  It 
came from the RSP's and the Equity funds and the Investments of 
individual working class -- people who believed these reports and 
invested.  The wealth of the ruling class was largely pulled out by 
the time such investments were exposed to the workers.So, is the lower caste necessarily stupid for saving money or 
investing in retirement plans?  I don't think so.  Are they stupid 
for buying clothes and automobiles?  I don't think so.At the granular level, the notion that ""most rich people are rich 
because they're smart"" is so anecdotal and naive that it's not 
worth arguing about, so I won't.  Still, a compelling point worth 
some clarification.-Ian.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

"just in time ! ! extra money for christmas you can earn $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days sending e-mail , seem impossible ? read on for details . "" as seen on national t . v . ! ! thank you for your time and interest . this is the letter you ' ve been reading about in the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . their findings proved , once and for all , that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program . this has helped to show people that this is a simple , harmless and fun way to make some extra money at home . the results of this show has been truly remarkable . so many people are participating that those involved are doing , much better than ever before . since everyone makes more as more people try it out , its been very exciting to be a part of it lately . you will understand once you experience it .

"" the enclosed information is something i almost slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is johnathon rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year , it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1997 1 received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1-800 - 725-2161 24 - hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not . "" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , my only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , 1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . your goal is to "" receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! "" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in . 90 days was done . by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 . your goal is to "" receive at least 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goa . l . "" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , 1 received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , johnathon rourke a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . the economy , inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . 1 do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending thousands and thousands of programs . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think a-bout it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! jody jacobs , richmond , va here ' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ instructions : this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say "" bull "" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e-mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do : 1 . order all 4 reports shown on the list below ( you can't sell them if you do n't order them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e-mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the four reports . you will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e-mail , each of the four reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 's of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their seqience on the list , in any way other than is instructed below in steps "" a "" through "" f "" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you ' ll also see how it does n't work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you ' ve ordered the four reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 4 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . d . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 . e . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . f . insert your name / address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e - mail is free ! there are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e-mail let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 99q out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would hpppen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing , tell you where to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e - mail lists . method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet advertising on the ' net is very , very inexpensive , and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . let 's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level . ( placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . ) assuming that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below . ist level - - your 10 members with $ 5 - - $ 50 2nd level - - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) $ 500 3rd level - - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) $ 5 , 000 4th level - - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 , 000 ) . $ 50 , 000 this totals - - - - - - - - - - - - $ 55 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 's of participants ! think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must dc , is e-mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide same-day service on all orders ! this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report ! available reports * * * order each report by number and name - 1 - - * * notes : - always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report cheques not accepted - always send your order via first class mail - make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , include : ( a ) the number & name of the report you are ordering , ( b ) your e-mail address , and ( c ) your name & postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 "" the insider 's guide to advertising for free on the internet "" order report # 1 from : crossroads enterprises 5507-10 nesconset hwy . # 317 mt . siani , ny . 11766 report # 2 "" the insider 's guide to sending bulk e - mail on the internet "" order report # 2 from : laura waite rfd1 box 798 campton , nh . 03223 report # 3 "" the secrets to multilevel marketing on the internet "" order report 43 from : philip webster 1011 second st . port orange , fl . 32119 report # 4 "" how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of multilevel marketing and the internet "" order report # 4 from : patricia arnold 174 windward ct . s . port jefferson , ny . 11777 about 50 , 000 new people get online every month ! * * * * * * * tips for success * * * * * * * * * * treat this as your business ! be prompt , professional , and follow the directions accurately . * * * send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in because : when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the requested product / report . always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , your results will be successful ! above all , have faith in yourself and know you wilt , succeed ! * * * * * * * your success guidelines * * * * * * * follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do n't receive 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . then , a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 . if you do n't , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e - mails or continue placing ads and start the whole process again ! there is no limit to the income you will generate from this business ! before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate in this program . please answer one question . do you want to change your life ?

"" their share price hasn ' t been bulletproof and that ' s what counts . they were up pushing $ 90 and they ' re now in the $ 50 s while the energy sector has done quite well , so they have underperformed quite a bit and that doesn ' t seem bulletproof to me , "" analyst andre meade of commerzbank securities said . meade said the price fall came as investors took the bad news out of enron ' s valuation , particularly in devaluing the broadband business . "" with broadband the market initially gave them full credit . but investors got smart over the next year , and once you got some bad news out there , you could argue that valuation was pulled , "" meade said . but the bad news neither starts nor ends there . the latest negative item came wednesday , when a california federal judge ordered enron to return the university of california and california state university systems to direct power access , which enron says will cost them $ 12 million a month . the universities ' lawsuit which claimed enron energy services breached their power management contract , could cast a shadow over the houston - based company ' s power risk management arm which recently saw a huge upsurge in business involving similar multimillion dollar deals with large corporations . other bad news includes broadband layoff talk , failed water company spinoff azurix inc . ' s impending sell - off its north american assets , the failure of the video on demand deal with blockbuster , word that the $ 2 billion sale of utility portland general is unlikely to go through and continuing payment problems at the dabhol power plant in india . that long - running dispute in india reared its head again on monday . enron confirmed it issued a notice of political force majeure to the maharashstra state electricity board ( mseb ) , which has consistently defaulted on payments . force majeure is an event beyond the control of a contractual party that could not have been prevented . "" it ' s one of the steps in the process of protecting our rights . it ' s one step , but it ' s not the only step , "" enron spokesman john ambler said . enron has already invoked payment guarantees from the indian national government , but it has refused to cover mseb ' s $ 21 . 9 million december bill until enron and mseb settle another dispute over a fine . the mseb wants the $ 85 . 8 million fine , which it levied , to cover its outstanding bills . layoffs or redeployments ? another nettling problem for enron is news of trouble at enron broadband services ( ebs ) , the cutting - edge unit that encompasses a nascent bandwidth trading operation and a broadband content services business . most recently , enron has had to answer questions about a reduction in the number of employees at ebs because of the stock market ' s faltering confidence in telecoms generally . two weeks ago , the company characterized word of layoffs at the broadband unit as nothing more than an internal redeployment of staff to areas that were growing at a higher rate . "" it ' s word games . initially they said they were redeploying , and that was not the word i heard from inside the company , but that was the way they put it . it ' s probably a little of both , "" said analyst john olson of houston investment house sanders morris harris . ebs spokeswoman kelly kimberly on monday said 227 employees were leaving the broadband unit to work in other areas of the company . "" most of them have elected to go into the redeployment pool or are already moved into corporate or another business , "" kimberly said . kimberly did not have an exact figure on the number who have opted to take a severance package , but characterized it as a small percentage . it has been a rough few weeks for ebs , which also suffered from the blockbuster debacle . last month , the two announced a mutual end to a 20 - year exclusive video on - demand deal , which had been considered a cornerstone of ebs ' content services push . folder name : rahil jafry relevance score on scale of 100 : 79 to review or revise your folder , visit http : / / www . djinteractive . com or contact dow jones customer service by e - mail at custom . news @ bis . dowjones . com or by phone at 800 - 369 - 7466 .

for cut/paste, but as usual mandates no *policy*.  Windows and Macintosh
have a slightly different mechanism and one uniform policy.  I'm quite
sure that Tk implements all PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD selections accurately.
The PRIMARY selection is the one that is tied to the visible selection
on your X display.  The CLIPBOARD selection is the one with the explicit
Copy step, and is the same as what you have on Windows and Macintosh.
However, exmh throws in support for the cutbuffer mechanism, which is
another archaic mechanism supported at one point (perhaps still today)
by versions of emacs.  Exmh has a policy that tries to unify all these
mechanisms under one umbrella, and by all reports it is not that great.I would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in
Text_Selection and report what works well for them.  We may come up
with 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another
setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models.  Of course,
that's an admission of policy failure, but I'm willing to do that.--

"More articles that support my fantasy that Irvine is the
center of the universe.  We've got the corner on electric
cars, fuel cells, two types of Nobel winning physics,
outside the box computer science, and lot of creative writers.UCI's creative writing department has been in the 
news a lot over the course of the last decade.  Some
quotes from the article[1]:   ""In 1992, Newsweek called UCI's fiction writing workshop
    'the hottest writing program in the country.' Now it's
    exponentially hotter, thanks only in part to Sebold's daring
    and uncannily timely novel. The novel they are talking about is Alice Sebold's ""The
Lovely Bones"" which is on the way to the top of the 
NY Times best-sellers list.  My uncle used to tease me
about UCI (being a USC graduate from '54) that nobody
knew who UC Irvine was just two states over.  In fact,
I used to refer to UCI as one of the lesser known UC
schools, and when I went off to college in 1985, my
relatives told everyone I was off to Cal State Irvine. 
I took a class as an undergrad by one of the department's 
faculty called ""the art of writing fiction"".   If there
was ever any two classes that helped contributed to writing
my dissertation, it was that one which taught me how to
get the writing flowing and my high school typing class
which taught me how to type really fast.  One of the advantages they cite in the article is that they
seem to take a chance on the ""not-so-sure"" bet, but according
to the article, the number of UCI graduates that have gone on
to write best sellers and the handful that feed the film industry
is creating a viscious cycle that lures more talent which
creates the right writing ecosystem, which churns out more
success stories which lures more talent.  Greg

I don't think there is a specific word in English for eye goop. 
However, when I was halfway literate in Tagalog, I learned that there is
a specific word in that language (or was it another dialect?) for it:
muta, pronounced ""MOO-ta"".  Even though my Tagalog has faded greatly, I
automatically use that word for ""eye goop"" when speaking English (how
often does that happen?), mostly because it apparently filled a
linguistic hole in my brain and therefore permanently wedged itself into
my vocabulary.Not that this is important, but I've inadvertently adopted ""muta"" into
my version of the English language as the word for ""eye goop"".  Arguably
better than ""smegma"" anyway.(Definitely Friday...)-James Rogers

HOME-MAILERS NEEDED!
  
$300-$1000 PLUS WEEKLYSimple, pleasant work...you do at home.
  
  
Dear Friend,
  
Are you seeking a rewarding second income? Would you like to set your
own work schedule? Work the hours you choose? Earn extra income for
your family? If so, then we may have the answer. Current statistics show
that by the year 2010, 40-60% of the American work-force will be working
from home. Get a jump on your future and secure a job through us. Our
company provides a service to thousands of people and businesses across
the United States. With your help, we can reach and provide a better
service to more of these people and businesses, faster and at a lower cost
than our competitors. We handle a marketing program called the
Home-Mailers Program, which consists of envelope processing and mailing.
These positions require no special skills or experience, just a sincere desire
to GET STARTED, and EARN MONEY!
  
  YOU CAN EARN GOOD MONEY!!!
  
   Potential incomes range from $300 to $1000 weekly or more. Pay rate is
based on a $2.00 per envelope basis. The average Home-Mailer
stuffs anywhere from 150 to 500 envelopes a week, depending on the
amount of free time they have available. The envelopes you process will
make you a substantial income. You'll find this work, done easily and
quickly, can double or even triple your income. With just one or two hours
per day you will be excitedly surprised at how easy we've made it and how
profitable this work actually is. You can earn enough money working in
your spare time to purchase that new car or boat you've been wanting,
pay off credit cards, bills, or even take a vacation. Maybe just add more
financial security for yourself or your family. Whatever the reason, you can't
go wrong.
  
  ALL BUSINESS CAN BE DONE RIGHT FROM YOUR OWN HOME
  
  You can start the same day you receive our materials and begin receiving
money within a matter of days. These positions require no prior experience
or special skills. Under contract you will receive everything you need to
get you up and running as fast as possible. Paychecks are mailed out every
two weeks on the 1st and 16th of the month.
  
  HELP SOLVE YOUR MONEY PROBLEMS
  
   If you are looking for an excellent extra income to relieve financial
pressures, you owe it to yourself to investigate this program. Naturally, no
company can afford to send out costly materials to everyone who writes in
asking for it. Therefore, we must ask each applicant for a one time
application processing fee of $27.00. This fee covers processing and
materials you will receive upon your acceptance and is returned to you
with your first paycheck. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with our company as a Home-Mailer. We will not ask or require
you to pay us for any additional information, instructions, or materials to
stay with us, and stay with us as long as you desire. If for any reason you
are not accepted into the Home-Mailers Program, your processing fee will
be sent directly back to you. There is no hassle. However, you must act
promptly. At this time we are in need of dependable Home-Mailers in your
area, of whom may start in the very near future. There are only a limited
number of positions needed for each region of the country and as soon as
we have enough people to complete the mailing needs in your area we
will not be offering any more applications. We need your help now! So if
you're a productive, positive person we're looking forward to working with
you.
  
  SIMPLE, EASY, AND PROFITABLE, THIS PROGRAM IS THE BEST
  WAY TO MAKE AN EXCELLENT INCOME AT HOME.
  
  If this sounds like something you might be interested in, read on. If not,
thank you for your time. We hope to hear from you soon.
  
  
Sincerely Yours,Ron M. Jenkins

  Because we are a company recruiting people from the public we must
assure you that we are the BEST company to work with and that we provide
the MOST PROFITABLE income. Because we require an initial fee to get
started, many people are skeptical, and miss out on a great opportunity.
This fee covers our expenses for materials, postage, handling, and the time
it takes us to get you started. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with the Home-Mailers Program. We know that current Home-
Mailers are happy and making an excellent income just from reading their
testimonials. This makes us happy and enables us to succeed and continue
our success together. Here are just a couple of the many testimonials
received from Home-Mailers:
  
  I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity
  to work for your company. It couldn't have come along
  at a better time. The work is so simple and the pay is
  incredible. My wife and I have been stuffing envelopes
  together part-time and are exceeding what either of us
  make at our full-time jobs. Thanks again!
     J. Thomas ------ Miami, FL
  
  Thank you for everything! I was having trouble
  making ends meet at my present employment. But
  thanks to you and your Home-Mailers Program, I was
  able to pay off some old bills and put money in the
  bank. Now I'm looking forward to taking a well
  deserved vacation.

Why do we need Home-Mailers? The cost of supplying an office is more
expensive than most people may think. The cost of office space per square
foot, + taxes employing mailing staff, + taxes employing supervisors, +
taxes, medical insurance, dental insurance, and office liability insurance,
multiplied by each region we cover, all involving paperwork, accountants
and more taxes. WE NEED YOUR SERVICES TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY!
Your role in our company is as an Independent Commission Mailer, not an
employee. We will not take taxes from your paychecks and we cannot offer
medical or dental insurance. As a Home-Mailer, your residence and many
other aspects of everyday living may be able to be declared business
expenses. Receive cash-back on your taxes! You may request copies of
personal materials at any time at no charge to yourself. All business can 
be done by mail, from your own home. You can start the same day you
receive our materials and begin receiving money within days and have a
steady income as long as you desire. These positions require no prior
experience or special skills. There are many distribution companies who
want to expand their businesses, but do not want to pay the higher 
expenses. It is much easier to have independent Home-Mailers earn 
money doing this work themselves. This program is designed to help 
people cash in with a company who needs Home-Mailers. The Home-Mailers
Program has been perfected so that it has become one of the most

That's done by bero - not too sure whether it works on
DVD+RW drives, I believe it supports only DVD-R.Would be nice to have a unified tool for DVD/CD
burning - already I do my CD burning from dvdrecord
since it is more recent.Regards,Michel__________________________________________________

I don't think you should worry too much about someone travelling out of 
the hive, but again, I'm curious as to how the driver actually modifies 
the keys on the server.> (2) The risks of a compromise to the client (far more likely).  This

open for something nasty here.
Two other things spring to mind; 
1) If anyone can modify the key, how do you make sure that two users are 
not overwriting the same key, thereby causing undesirable effects.
2) If anyone have permissions to write to the key (and below), anyone can 
create thousands of extra keys under this key, thereby filling up the 
registry. The result of such a thing is obvious.If I got this all wrong, I'd be happy that you clarify a bit more and tell 
me where I might have misunderstood.

"webmodal please read the following message from dan reck regarding webmodal . thank you . - - - - - forwarded by cathy phillips / hou / ect on 02 / 14 / 2001 07 : 25 am - - - - - daniel reck 02 / 13 / 2001 01 : 48 pm to : cathy phillips / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : webmodal at monday ' s egm meeting , mike mcconnell asked me to describe the webmodal acquisition egm made last week . following is a brief description of the freight capacity market and what webmodal gets us : market the us market for logistics is $ 600 bn annually . we are pursuing the largest homogenous segment which is long - haul truckload and intermodal . that market is $ 50 - $ 100 bn annually , depending on who you ask and whether you include dedicated fleets . the interesting thing about these markets is that they are extremely fragmented and massively intermediated . there are over 100 , 000 trucking companies ( carriers ) in the us and thousands of independent brokers ( brokers in this market act as credit principals ) . 10 - 20 % of all loads are conducted in the spot market ( brokered ) and the rest are done under 1 - 3 year contracts that are generally non - firm , but define the relationship between each shipper and their chosen carriers or intermediaries . on the rail side , the us railroads act as wholesalers , selling their capacity to intermodal marketing companies ( imcs ) . the imcs then retail or broker out that capacity to shippers . the difficult part of ground intermodal is that the rail haul makes up only the long - haul component . the trip from the origin warehouse to the origin rail yard and then the delivery from the destination rail yard to the destination warehouse has to be done by truck . this first and last mile transportation is called "" drayage "" . webmodal webmodal developed a system to price and schedule intermodal moves so they look identical to truck . they have a database with prices and schedules from all the rrs and 48 drayage companies that gives them complete us coverage . a buyer can type in their scheduling and equipment requirements and receive instantaneous quotes for zipcode to zipcode service . because of the inherently different cost and performance structures of rail and truck , the pricing differences between the two modes of transportation is significant . for any move greater than 500 miles , intermodal is generally 20 - 30 % less expensive than a single driver truck move . the substitutability of intermodal and truckload should allow us to trade the spread in price . the webmodal acquisition gets us a team with tremendous industry expertise and a good head start as we enter this market . the next move will be to build a truck intermediation capability . i encourage you to meet chris kravas the ceo of webmodal . he will be spending all of his time in houston when he is not on the road . please give me a call if you have any questions . thanks , dan reck",Safe Email

chemical sector of the multi - billion dollar agri - chemical industry . the company ' s common stock trades under the ticker symbol usbo . pk . us biotec ( usbo ) was established to profitably develop , manufacture , market and distribute bio - degradable , non - toxic and non - carcinogenic products to agriculture , the commercial turf industry , forestry , golf courses , professional landscapers , nurseries and mass market retail lawn and garden markets . the company ' s products are designed to rehabilitate and protect soils and plants through all natural , environmentally friendly alternatives to toxic fertilizers . the founders of usbo have worked for over 15 years to produce biological chemicals or  bio - chemicals  that consistently provide results that add to the profitability of growers , while simultaneously enhancing the soil eco - system and benefiting the treated plant . the products the company has developed offer a better way to care for your crop , lawn , garden , house plants , flowers and most significantly , the environment . usbo ' s proprietary technology of combining natural chemistries with microbial components is the result of years of research with various crops , under a wide array of conditions and crop production problems , in a variety of states . as a result of this effort of product development and on - going refinement , usbo ' s products are state - of - the - art in their ease of application and product performance . in test markets , the company ' s products have proven to stimulate plant growth and / or increase yield by 10 % to 30 % , depending on the species treated and prevailing environmental conditions . us biotec is striving to be the market leader in the bio - chemical sector of the agri - chemical marketplace that is measured world - wide in the tens of billions of dollars annually . us biotec has developed a full line of biodegradable , non - toxic and non - carcinogenic products for the agricultural , forestry , commercial turf , golf course , professional landscaping and mass retail lawn and garden markets . us biotec ' s ecologically friendly products can replace many of the toxic pesticides and caustic fertilizers commonly used in the agricultural industry . a second advantage beyond being environmentally friendly is that the company ' s field studies conducted in four test markets since 1991 indicate that us biotec ' s products can stimulate plant growth and increase vegetable crop yield by 10 % to 30 % depending on the crop and environmental conditions . us biotec plans to hire a third party to conduct independent tests to determine the precise impact the company ' s products have on crop yield . by altering the concentration of natural components , such as phosphorlating compounds , enzymes , amino acids , minerals , carbohydrates , vitamins and microbes in each product , us biotec can custom design a compound for use on specific crop production problems . for example , some of us biotec ' s products are designed to stimulate root growth and another may promote leaf growth , while another can enhance fruiting buds and yet a different product can help alleviate seasonal water stress . the different primary functions of these biotech products are achieved by altering the ratio and concentration of the common components . us biotec believes that biochemical technology could revolutionize the way food is grown ! usbo ' s products stimulate healthier plants that produce higher quantities of crops , and the company ' s soil products help correct many microbial and mineral problems present in soils today . plus , us biotec ' s soil biostimulants help to rehabilitate the soil ecosystem by breaking down the residual build - up of toxic insecticides , herbicides , fungicides and synthetic fertilizers , thus promoting the restoration of soil to its natural , pre - polluted state . equally as important is the fact that the company believes these biotech products are economically feasible for the majority of produce growers to purchase considering their current commodity prices . us biotec ' s products are formulated with bio - chemical components and this bio - chemical technology is not related to genetic engineering technology . us biotec ' s biostimulants do not influence a seed ' s gene function , but work instead to stimulate vegetative plant growth , promote fruiting sites and enhance the plant ' s immune system function against natural enemies after germination . although , it is logical that healthier plants will produce all - around healthier seeds . us biotec has already completed its research and development phase , and has formulated approximately thirty products that it believes to be commercially viable . usbo is planning to launch all of its agricultural products in the spring of 2005 , and currently plans to launch all of its existing products within 36 months of january 2005 . / / / / / / / / / strategy \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ us biotec  s mission is to establish itself as a profitable industry leader , pioneering the development , manufacturing , marketing and distribution of bio - degradable , non - toxic and non - carcinogenic products to the agriculture , forest , commercial turf , golf course , professional landscaping and commercial nursery industries as well as to the mass market retail lawn and garden market . us biotec believes it already has a very distinct advantage over its competition because it currently has approximately 30 practical , environmentally friendly bio - chemical products ready to be introduced in various existing markets . usbo is in the process of launching its agricultural products by july 2005 . the company  s strategic plan is as follows : / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / growth strategy \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ it is the ultimate goal of us biotec  s management team to effectively build up the company to sustained profitability while providing shareholders with competitive returns on equity . us biotec may also choose to utilize an aggressive acquisition strategy to consolidate the highly fragmented and immature bio - chemicals industry . continued funding of research development will provide two exceptional products that are some 24 - 30 months from mass marketing status . / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / diversification strategy \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ as us biotec builds its brand name , product recognition , distribution network and reputation as the industry leader in the environmentally friendly bio - chemical solutions market , the company will simultaneously seek out other eco - friendly products to distribute . as part of its growth strategy through strategic alliances , us biotec intends to distribute complementary products manufactured by other companies to applicable markets . usbo  s policy is to stay current with new products and technologies wherever and whenever reasonable and profitable . still , as the company comes across smaller companies that lack distribution capabilities or capital to market their products , but have redeeming products that are ready for market , usbo may form strategic alliances that draw upon the company  s distribution capability to increase revenues through these third party distribution agreements . / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / marketing and sales strategy \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ us biotec understands that providing revolutionary products is not enough to guarantee the company  s financial success . this is why usbo has designed a detailed marketing and sales strategy that takes into account the unique characteristics of how the agri - chemical industry , the retail lawn and garden industry , the golf course industry , etc . operate . the company  s marketing and sales strategy may potentially include the use of teams of independent manufacturer  s representatives ( reps ) . each division picks only the best reps that possess both expertise in the science of our products and strong , established relationships with the particular customers and markets they will be targeting . sales representatives in the agriculture and commercial markets will be closely supported by us biotec  s highly trained in - house technical sales representatives ( tsr ) . these tsrs will be available to provide situational analysis , product recommendations and ongoing training , plus information to the teams of reps , dealer sales organizations and customers . the marketing of lawn and garden products will be given to an experienced professional rep group or by hiring an experienced professional mass market guru . / / / / / / / / / / headlines \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  us biotec set to release products to help cotton farmers fri , nov 19 -

The real question is: is there a way to run razor without this overhead?  
Even some sort of razord you could talk to over a unix socket would do.
Until I can find one, I cannot spare the resources to run razor at all :(-------------------------------------------------------

count it as one of my skills.David--

"deal confirmation changes good afternoon ron , we just had a meeting with bill williams , head of real - time trading in portland , to discuss some problems we are having with the real - time deals flowing to the deal confirmation system . currently , the deal confirmation system is pulling the term information so that changes made by real - time to reflect actual volumetric flow & price are not seen by the confirmation groups . one possible solution has already been examined and that would be to have the real - time traders use deal entry to make all the changes . this solution will not work . if the real - time guys start changing the deals in deal entry , the original negotiated deal will be lost . also , and more importantly , the time to make all the changes for the real - time adjustments in deal entry would make it impossible to keep up with the high volume of deals we are now seeing . thanks , david poston it manager , portland",Safe Email

work, both up front, and then on an ongoing basis.  I know 
nothing about how the trust system is working (still waiting for 
that long-promised server code to be published), but now that 
it's been turned on, and the more info that's coming out about 
it, the more concerned I'm becoming that it's extremely easy to 
game; that the initial amount of work to set up a gaming agent 
is low, and that once it's set up, it can be ""fire and forget"" 
in terms of continuing to operate in a way that's not easy to 
distinguish from real user behavior.> Sure, you can find a way to work almost any system, but few

> will actually take the time to game the system.Another concern I have with the way the system might be working 
is that it might not actually require very many gamers at all to 
utterly undermine the whole system.  There are a certain number 
of possible universes where the trust system is very sensitive 
to liars, or misclassifiers of ""gray"" mail, or both.  It's not 
clear yet whether this universe is one of those or not.> That means that we might have a system that is less than 100%

> (Complex
> systems, time numbing hours of coding etc.)You do need a certain level of accuracy though, or the filter is 
not economically worthwhile.  If you only filter 75% of spam, 
you're wasting your time.  Some people receive on the order of a 
10:1 ratio of spam:real mail -- 75% means the ratio adjusts to 
5:2 which is still shitty.  95% makes it 1:2, which is better.  
99% makes it 1:10 which is quite nice.  As the global ratio of 
spam:mail rises, this problem gets somewhat more important.  
With an order of magnitude worsening of the incoming spam:real 
ratio, 100:1, 99% effective still works OK.  75% effective is 
now really, really shitty.

would argue that any system will have a non-zero FP rate, 
including the ""no filter"" filter -- humans make mistakes too 
sometimes!  As spammer strategies evolve over time though, I'm 
fairly sure that SA will be able to adjust and compensate.  If 
spammers figure out how to easily pollute the SpamNet trust 
system, I'm not sure how easy it'll be to replace the trust 
system with something else.> Perhaps Craig is just theorizing, but I just thought I'd offer my two

quite resource intensive (judging by Cloudmark's fundraising 
efforts), and doesn't currently work.  It has great promise, and 
I'm hoping that once the wrinkles are worked through, it'll add 
another powerful tool in the war on spam -- I'm just concerned 
that it's getting off on the wrong foot and might not be able to 
recover.C-------------------------------------------------------

"This is happening due to insufficient write access to the
""razor-agent.log"" file. I was getting the same error, but
only as a non-root user.  As a quick workaround, you can do
""chmod go+w razor-agent.log"".In Agent.pm, when then the Logger object is created, it
doesn't check whether the logfile is writable by the current
user. Then, when a write attempt is made, it bails out with
the ""unblessed reference"" error.Hope that helps,

"suggestion...
as I see it, there is a valid need for a ""razor-cache"" server that is
available to the local smtp host...
recursiveness would also be a nice feature, giving us the option to link
caches to offload the burden on the razor servers...
it could also allow us to setup local razor caches for private networks that
can bypass the razor servers all together...

"HelloYou may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""More testimonials later but first, =========== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ====
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!INSTRUCTIONS:=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 26.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :

""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand

The fonts are ugly only inside of gnome2 and clean for gnome1 apps, if

This is difficult to understand for me.--

"typological method pace fritz newmeyer , there has been extensive discussion of the methodological issues that he raises . ( these remarks are independent of any assessment of johanna nichol 's book that fritz referred to , incidentally . ) first , good typological work devotes a substantial amount of effort to defining and delimiting what sorts of constructions should or should not belong to a particular structural type . good examples are many of dryer 's papers ( e . g . dryer 1989a , 1989b , 1992 ) , koptjevskaja - tamm 1990 : ch . 1 - 3 on nominalizations , stassen 1985 : ch . 2 , 4 on comparative and ' chaining ' constructions , and haspelmath 1993 : ch . 2 on indefinite pronouns . more generally , the discussion of the proper typological markedness criteria in croft 1990 : ch . 4 - 6 is an attempt to provide some * general * structural criteria for a large class of cross-linguistic phenomena ( see for example the formulation of the structural consequences of hopper & thompson 1980 's transitivity hypothesis on p . 131 , or the application of the criteria to the syntactic category problem in croft 1991 : ch . 2 - 3 ) . delimiting and classifying the phenomena to be analyzed is not a simple descriptive task ; in fact , it raises some of the most interesting issues in typological analysis , and have hardly been ignored in the typological literature . second , with respect to basicness for a language type in particular , in the passage from croft 1990 that fritz referred to ( pp . 33-36 ) , i argued that typologists had moved from classifying languages typologically to classifying constructions typologically , and that that was a good thing . nevertheless , i suggested some general criteria for determining a "" basic "" language type . and despite my reservations about identifying "" basic "" language types , it has to be said that in the great majority of cases , defining a "" language type "" instead of a "" construction type "" is not terribly difficult . matthew dryer ( p . c . ) has observed that inspection of texts generally tells you very quickly what the "" word order type "" of a language is . in my own experience , in a study where i am comparing the syntax of prenominal and postnominal modifiers , i am quite frustrated at how difficult it is to find languages where a modifier freely occurs both pre - and postnominally . of course , identification of "" basic "" or other types depends on what resources you have available to you ( quality of grammatical descriptions , availability of texts / language consultants etc . ) as well as what phenomenon you are studying ( e . g . word order or head marking [ easier ] vs . relative order of modifiers or the syntax of nonrestrictive modification [ harder ] ) . but for most studies it is not an insurmountable problem , although there always some problematic cases . third , the sampling problem * has * been discussed at some length by typologists ( besides bell 1978 's seminal article , see also dryer 1989c , perkins 1989 , croft 1990 : 18-25 , rijkhoff et al . 1993 ) . the issues are too complex to go into here at length . but it should be pointed out that the issues fritz raises apply to different sorts of samples with different purposes in mind . the question of how independent particular instances are have to do with probability samples ( see in particular the dryer , perkins and croft references for discussion of these problems ) . note in particular that the stability of the phenomenon being studied is an important factor : the less stable it is , the more likely cases are historically independent . the question of coming across rare types pertains to variety samples ( see in particular rijkhoff et al . ) . some studies ( e . g . tomlin 1986 , koptjevskaja - tamm 1990 , haspelmath 1993 ) draw on a very large variety sample and then select a stratified probability sample from it for the appropriate generalizations . dryer 's sampling technique attempts to combine the needs of variety and probability samples into a single sampling procedure . i should also add that with the shift towards dynamic ( diachronic ) interpretations of synchronic typological patterns , the examination of cognate phenomena in related languages , and the comparison of "" nonbasic "" as well as basic typological strategies , becomes another important method of analysis . that means that to some extent , the problems of basic vs . nonbasic types in a single language , and of historical relatedness of data sets , can be avoided - - - in fact , exploited - - - in modern typological analysis . bill croft references : bell , alan . 1978 . language samples . universals of human language , vol . 1 : method and theory , ed . joseph h . greenberg , charles a . ferguson and edith a . moravcsik , 123-156 . stanford : stanford university press . croft , william . 1990 . typology and universals . cambridge : cambridge university press . - . 1991 . syntactic categories and grammatical relations : the cognitive organization of information . chicago : university of chicago press . dryer , matthew . 1989a . plural words . linguistics 27 . 865-95 . - . 1989b . article - noun order . cls 25 . 84-97 . - . 1989c . large linguistic areas and language sampling . studies in language 13 . 257-92 . - . 1992 . the greenbergian word order correlations . language 68 : 81 - 138 . hopper , paul and sandra a . thompson . 1980 . transitivity in grammar and discourse . language 56 . 251-299 . koptjevskaja - tamm , maria . 1988 . a typology of action nominal constructions . stockholm : university of stockholm . perkins , revere d . 1989 . statistical techniques for determining language sample size . studies in languagea013 : 293-315 . rijkhoff , jan , dik bakker , kees hengveld & peter kahrel . a method of language sampling . studies in language 17 . 169-203 . stassen , leon . 1985 . comparison and universal grammar . oxford : basil blackwell . tomlin , russell . 1986 . basic word order : functional principles . london : croom helm . dept of linguistics , u manchester , oxford rd , manchester m13 9pl , uk w . croft @ manchester . ac . uk fax : + 44-61 - 275 3187 phone : 275 3188",Safe Email
"interesting article interesting article , especially since it came from britain . . . it does mention enron too . the next global city ? the blob that ate east texas jun 21 st 2001 houston from the economist print edition ( june 23 , 2001 ) for most outsiders , texas is a foreign country . its biggest city , though , might surprise the rest of the world when a texan in a big hat tells you how wonderful his home town is , reach for the salt . bob lanier , the former mayor of houston , isn ' t actually wearing a stetson as he gazes from his penthouse down on a city that sprawls 25 miles away in every direction . but metaphorically he is . houston , he claims , could become one of the great cities of the world . the remarkable thing is that he might be right . from the time the city was founded in 1836 until the 1970 s , houston doubled in size almost every decade . then , despite one of the deepest slumps any city had experienced since the 1930 s , the metropolitan area managed to add lm people in the 1990 s to grow to 4 . 7 m , making houston the fourth - largest city in america . it is already bigger than berlin and , with a gdp of around $ 215 billion a year , has a larger economy than hong kong . because it is the nearest metropolis to the cities of northern mexico , it may attract another 2 m people over the next two decades , which would give it almost the same size of population as london has now . but a global city ? these are few and far between . houston can hardly dream of becoming a global financial centre like london , new york or tokyo . but its business leaders think it could become a cosmopolitan , entrepreneurial hub , a hong kong , a san francisco or even a new los angeles . it shares la ' s smog , its sprawl , its latino culture , even its ugly hubris ; and by some measures it surpasses la ' s ability to reinvent its economy . can it use its adaptability to turn itself into a properly international place ? oil be there for you its hopes still depend disproportionately on its most global industry . energy accounts for half of houston ' s economy . during the 1970 s , while the rest of america stagflated , houston boomed as high oil prices sucked billions into the country ' s oil capital . in that decade alone , the city built almost as much new office space as the total amount of commercial property available in san francisco . money was being lent and business plans formed on the assumption that oil would go to $ 50 a barrel . at the height of the boom , about 80 % of the city ' s economy was oil - related . the bust was traumatic . by the mid - 1980 s , all that new office space stood empty . every big local bank was taken over . only one of the property developers then in business is left . unsurprisingly , a certain paranoia lingers in the city about the oil business . the greater houston partnership , the main business lobby , has spent the past 20 years frantically encouraging the city to diversify . yet the fact is that the energy business and houston itself have emerged stronger from the terrible bust . as company after company was forced to cut back , they collapsed their operations back into houston and seem unlikely to be dispersed again . in 1999 , when oil slumped to $ 10 a barrel and the number of oil rigs in america fell to its lowest point in living memory , houston still managed to add energy jobs . now another boom is in prospect , with oil prices high again . matt simmonds , the head of a local energy consultancy , argues that america ' s past reluctance to build new power plants will force it to increase energy capacity by around 30 % in the next ten or 15 years . the rig count is already 50 % above last year , and natural gas exploration is soaring . if oil prices stay high ( a big if ) and if other countries share america ' s energy worries , houston will grow in importance . it is hampered by a wild - catting reputation . in fact , the energy business is changing in three significant ways , and houston is the centre of all of them . first , technology . not long ago , oil drills went down to 1 , 500 feet ( 457 metres ) . now they go to 15 , 000 feet . companies use four - dimensional computer imaging to plan new fields ( time is the fourth ) . this is making oil an information - intensive business and puts a premium on the kinds of skills available in houston . second , the cost of new oilfield exploration and development has risen so far that even newly merged behemoths cannot always finance them alone . this makes deal - making vital , which is good for the city where deals are made . if you are not attending , say , lunch at houston ' s petroleum club , you are out of the loop . third and most important , oil is now only part of a bigger energy business , which includes electricity . once divided into self - contained regional markets run by local utilities , the electricity business is being changed by the gradual emergence of a national grid dominated by power producers and traders . big users now decide whether to buy power at long - or short - term rates , rather as they arrange their financing . a new business of energy arbitraging is emerging , and itscentre is houston . three of the five new skyscrapers going up downtown have as their main tenants energy companies that did not exist ten years ago . one of them , enron , is building a 50 , 000 - square - foot trading floor ? ? single - company answer to the chicago board of trade . enron has probably been houston ' s most successful energy company of the past ten years . it has never explored for , pumped up , or refined a single drop ofoil . out of the black stuff however well - placed houston is to take advantage of the energy business , it will never be a great city as a one - trick pony . its boosters point to other strengths : * trade . houston is america ' ssecond largest port , which is remarkable considering it is 50 miles from the sea . * computers . the city is home to compaq , america ' s third - largest pc maker . if you include dell , based in austin , two of america ? ? four big computer firms are in south - east texas , not silicon valley . * space . the national aeronautics and space administration centre is in houston , thanks to lyndonjohnson , a native son . * medicine . houston is home to probably the largest medical complex in the world . in a moment of extraordinary optimism , the city set aside 700 acres in the middle of town for medicine . the hospitals , clinics and research centres of the texas medical centre employ 55 , 000 people and deal with 70 , 000 patients a day . st luke ' s has performed more heart surgery than any other hospital in the world . md anderson and the texas children ' s hospital are among the top two in their respective specialities , cancerand paediatrics . this list has holes in it . houston has no real financial services ( the mainstay of the biggest global cities ) or pharmaceuticals ( despite the medical centre ) . and some of its new industries are less robust than the boosters claim . its port ' s success depends on the vagaries of mexico ' s economy . space does not employ many people and is unlikely to grow until the far - off day when the commercialisation of space arrives . the texas medical centre is set up on a not - for - profit basis , so it has not been able to commercialise its activities ( hence the lack of drug firms ) , though a new biotechnology park may help . in fact , houston ' s main hope for diversifying lies not so much in particular sectors as in something intangible : its stunning ability to create new firms . for the past three years , houston has created more new companies than any city in america . it is almost certainly the best place either to start a business or find a first - time job . the reasons for this are the real driving forces behind its success . the beauty of entrepreneurialism the first is unmeasurable , a no - holds - barred optimism of the old school . one survey shows that about two - thirds of americans agree with the assertion that if you work hard in this city , eventually you will succeed . but houston ' s figure even at the bottom of the city ' s recession was 75 % , and now it is 88 % , the highest - ever , and ( says the survey ' s author , stephen klineberg of rice university ) the highest of any bigamerican city . it may not be true that anything is possible in houston , but people act as if it were . bill gilmer , the chief economist of the houston branch of the federal reserve system , argues that this explains why houston recovered so fast from the oil bust : unemployed engineers went out and set up their own firms , just as aerospace engineers did in los angeles when the end of the cold war put them out of business . the second advantage is technical . uniquely for an american metropolis , houston has no citywide zoning ordinances . when planning decisions are made , they are made by developers on their own land . for the would - be entrepreneur , it is thus easier and cheaper to find a place to set up shop in houston than in any other city in america . lack of zoning laws hands power to developers who insist that new developments be large to capture economies of scale . they expand in leapfrog fashion , ignoring small 20 - acre plots near the city centre in favour of vast planned towns further out . this drives land prices sharply down , especially the further you go from the centre . on top of that , an aversion to red tape makes it easy to get building permits . barton smith , a land economist at the university of houston , reckons lack of red tape is at least as important to keep costs low as lack of zoning laws . lack of zoning also makes neighbourhoods slightly more mixed in terms of usage ( residential and commercial are more muddled up than elsewhere ) and racially . because there are no zoning laws to force , say , a bankrupt restaurant to re - open as a restaurant , areas change shape quickly . at the same time , houston is less segregated racially than any other city , bymost measures . one should not be over - impressed by this . whites in houston may be more likely than their peers elsewhere to have had a conversation with someone of a different race in the previous week , but that hasn ' t stopped them heading for the suburbs . much of the racial mixture downtown is of blacks , latinos and asians ( the city has america ' s second - largest vietnamese settlement after southern california ) . but because zoning laws do not enable local groups to keep poor people out ( for example , by requiring that all housing plots be huge ) , houston remains racially desegregated by american standards . this helps draw in immigrant workers , creating a pool of labour . that leads to the third of houston ' s main characteristics which should prove an advantage in the 21 st century : racial tolerance . houston looked like a southern town until the 1970 s : white , with a large black minority . a generation later , its population is roughly one - third white , one - third black and ( slightly over ) one - third brown . other cities have similar profiles but none went from a bi - racial to amulti - racial city quite so abruptly . even more strikingly , it did so peacefully . houston has not had a race riot since 1914 . for the largest southern city to have gone through the civil - rights era and its aftermath without upheaval is a remarkable comment on its politics . minorities have long been fully or over - represented in the city council , county commissions and the texas state legislature . bob stein of rice university argues that , unlike other growing cities , houston is reinventing the tradition of a powerful group of civic - minded business leaders , the fate of whose companies is closely tied to that of the city . ken lay , enron ' s chairman , is an example . he has been the driving force behind the building of two sports stadiums , and has a pet project to boost child literacy . rumour has it that he may run for mayor . the effect of this sort of civic - minded activism showed up in the late 1990 s . at a time when america was busily abolishing affirmative - action programmes , houston went the other way : it had a new one approved in a city - wide referendum . for better or worse , this showed how racially tolerant it is . for how much longer ? in many ways , houston is thriving because it has kept alive an old - fashioned , industrial mode of growth , built on cheap land , low taxes , immigrant labour and unfettered pro - business policies . this model may not be enough in the next decades . houston is ugly . it was hardly charming to begin with and has pulled down many of its old buildings . it may have to pull down even more after recent floods caused $ 2 billion - worth of damage . it is also , as al gore rudely pointed out during the presidential campaign , polluted . since cities now have to attract skilled workers with quality of life benefits , this is a big problem , and not one that can be overcome by cheap housing . business leaders are frantically trying to catch up . in an unusual example of bipartisanship , a fervently conservative property developer has joined forces with a former member of the clinton administration to back a $ 500 m bond issue to plant lm trees . the greater houston partnership has executed an about - turn on pollution . having argued last year that new pollution controls damage growth , it is now on a crash course to cut ozone - creating emissions as fast as it can . if this sudden change of mind is real , it poses a tough question about zoning . houston has 2 , 300 people an acre , compared with 6 , 000 in los angeles and 20 , 000 in new york ( at the other end of the scale ) . this extraordinary extensiveness is expensive . at one point in the early 1990 s , houston alone was spending more on roads than any state except california ( and , of course , texas ) . there are doubts about how much further sprawl can go . three - quarters of the best - paid jobs are still on or within the inner ring road . some new suburbs are 50 miles away . can the city continue to burst outwards while attracting the skilled people whose jobs are downtown ? and surely that means introducing zoning ? lastly , houston faces a severe problem in the one area where its national reputation is high : education . to run his number - one priority , mr bush picked as secretary of education rod paige , a former head of the houston independent school district . the president claimed , correctly , that mr paige had overseen substantial improvements in the city ' s education , especially among minorities . what he did not say is that these improvements have been nothing like enough . despite successes in individual schools , half of all latinos fail to graduate from high school , compared with 10 % of whites and 20 % of blacks . whites are abandoning houston ' s public schools . they represent only 12 % of pupils ; 54 % are latino . more than a quarter of today ' s schoolchildren are likely to dropout . in a world where a good job depends on having a college degree , this is alarming . rice university ' s mr klineberg argues that new immigrants from mexico arrive lagging further behind the rest of the country educationally than did the wave of immigrants in the early 1900 s . the first wave took several generations to catch up . today ' s immigrants will have to close a bigger gap more quickly . if they do not , they may end up in an underclass that could scratch at houston ' sracial harmony . this is houston can houston make it ? the city has experienced the three big transformations that affect america in their purest form : the change from a raw - material economy to services ; the change from a bi - racial to a multi - racial place ; and the moderation of a no - holds - barred pro - business culture to take account of environmental and social costs . elsewhere , these changes have occurred over 50 years . houston has lived through them in 20 . and the next 20 years will probably be just as dramatic and successful . hold onto those stetsons . copyright ? ? 1995 -

"book review ( cheng ) : on the typology of wh - questions cheng , lisa lai - shen . ( 1997 ) . on the typology of wh - questions . outstanding dissertations in linguistics series . garland publishing , new york & london . 210 pages . reviewed by kerstin hoge , university of oxford introduction this book ( originally written as the author 's 1991 ph . d . dissertation ) attempts to account for the full range of cross-linguistic variation found with single and multiple wh-questions . to this aim , cheng proposes the clausal typing hypothesis which postulates a parameter that identification ( or ' typing ' ) of a sentence as a wh-question is achieved either by a question particle or by overt wh-movement . the first part of the book ( chapters 2 and 3 ) discusses the clausal typing hypothesis and its predictions and implications for the analysis of wh-in - situ languages , single movement languages , optional movement languages and multiple fronting languages . data from multiple fronting languages lead cheng to an investigation of the interpretation and inherent properties of wh-words in a number of languages . this marks the transition to the second part of the book ( chapters 4 and 5 ) which shifts the focus to wh-words and quantificational phenomena in mandarin chinese . cheng 's book provides an extensive overview of the differences exhibited across languages with respect to wh-question formation and presents an interesting attempt to unify two previously separate approaches to wh-movement in arguing that both properties of c and of the wh-words themselves are responsible for the observed typological distinctions . synopsis chapter 1 presents the general aims and outline of the book and briefly introduces the phrase structure of mandarin chinese , which features prominently in the book as an example of a wh-in - situ language . chapter 2 introduces the clausal typing hypothesis . cheng observes that languages which allow for wh-in - situ in single questions invariably use overt markings ( such as particles ) in matrix yes-no questions . if a language has an overt yes-no question particle , it will also have a wh-question particle , which may but need not be overt . question particles and overt wh-movement , both of which identify a clause as an interrogative , are thus mutually exclusive . to account for this generalisation , cheng proposes that clauses are typed at s - structure either by a wh-particle or by overt wh-movement but crucially not by both in one language , cf . ( 1 ) . ( 1 ) clausal typing hypothesis every clause needs to be typed . in the case of typing a wh-question , either a wh-particle in c is used or else fronting of a wh-word to the spec of c is used , thereby typing a clause through c by spec - head agreement . ( = cheng 1997 : 22 , ( 9 ) ) the two available strategies are illustrated by mandarin chinese and english , respectively . mandarin chinese satisfies clausal typing by base-generating a wh-particle in c . consequently , all wh-phrases will stay in-situ . overt wh-movement is ruled out by the principle of economy of derivation ( chomsky 1989 ) , according to which movement is more costly than merge , a ' last resort ' operation and applicable only when clausal typing could not be achieved otherwise . at lf , wh-phrases move to speccp for scope , selection and absorption purposes . english uses overt wh-movement to satisfy clausal typing , i . e . c acquires the [ + wh ] - feature of the xp in its specifier . the clausal typing hypothesis further requires cheng to make the following assumptions with respect to english : ( i ) subject wh-phrases must undergo overt movement ( contra the vacuous movement hypothesis ) , ( ii ) no q - morpheme or [ + wh ] - feature is base-generated in c , and ( iii ) ' whether ' and ' if ' are not question particles . chapter 3 discusses optional and multiple wh-fronting languages which present a challenge to the clausal typing hypothesis . optional fronting languages appear to use both modes of clausal typing , i . e . they allow for wh-fronting although they have a wh-particle ( given the possibility of wh-in - situ ) . using egyptian arabic , bahasa indonesia and palauan as languages of investigation , cheng argues that questions with fronted wh-phrases in optional fronting languages do not instantiate overt wh-movement but display clear similarities to cleft and topicalisation structures . thus , a ' fronted ' wh-argument is base-generated as the subject of a reduced cleft construction , while a fronted wh-adjunct has undergone topicalisation . optional fronting languages are then straightforward in-situ languages which satisfy clausal typing by base-generating a wh-particle in ( matrix ) c . multiple fronting languages appear to violate the principle of economy of derivation in that all wh-phrases must move at s - structure although clausal typing is satisfied by single wh-movement . extending nishigauchi 's ( 1990 ) analysis of japanese wh-words , cheng suggests that bare wh-words in multiple fronting languages are similar to indefinites , i . e . they lack inherent quantificational force and simply introduce variables into the semantic representation which must be bound by other elements in the sentence . it is thus not surprising that the interpretation of a wh-word in a multiple fronting language can vary with its context . for example , polish wh-words are interpreted as interrogatives when fronted , receive a d ( iscourse ) - linked reading when in-situ , are used as polarity items in yes-no questions and conditional sentences , and form the morphological base of indefinites , filling out the whole paradigms of person , place and time . cheng now argues that the four different readings arise because there are four different binders which determine the quantificational force of the bare wh-word ( wh ) in these contexts , as schematised in ( 2 ) . ( 2 ) binders ( and readings ) of polish wh - words : a . wh is bound by an overt d ( eterminer ) ( existential reading ) b . wh is bound by a null d with interrogative force ( interrogative reading ) c . wh is bound by existential closure ( polarity reading ) d . wh is bound by a [ + wh ] c ( d - linked reading ) null determiners which contribute interrogative quantificational force need to be licensed and identified by feature matching with a [ + wh ] c at s - structure . it is thus to satisfy the licensing requirement of the null determiner that all wh-phrases in multiple fronting languages move to a position governed by c . the chapter also contains a discussion of rudin 's ( 1988 ) proposal to distinguish between multiple fronting languages which allow for multiply filled speccp ( e . g . bulgarian , romanian ) and those where speccp can host only one wh-phrase and all other wh-phrases are ip - adjoined ( e . g . polish , czech ) . here , cheng proposes to replace rudin 's ecp - style account of superiority effects with an analysis that derives them from the 's hortest movement ' condition , so as to account for the observed [ subject + adjunct ] and [ object + adjunct ] orderings of wh-phrases in the bulgarian - type languages . moreover , she suggests analysing ip - adjunction as q ( uantifier ) r ( aising ) and thus as clausebound , thereby ruling out multiple wh-extraction from embedded clauses in polish - type languages . in chapter 4 cheng examines wh-words in mandarin chinese and analyses them as polarity items which require both a trigger and a binder for interpretation , cf . ( 3 ) . ( 3 ) wh - words in mandarin chinese reading trigger binder - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - interrogative wh-particle wh-particle ( unselective binder ) polarity yes-no particle / existential closure negation ( unselective binder ) universal dou ' all ' dou ' all ' ( selective binder ) thus , when a wh-word is interpreted as an interrogative , it is licensed by a wh-particle which will also bind it and contribute interrogative force to it . the polarity reading is triggered by a yes-no particle or negation , and the binder of the wh-word is introduced by existential closure which will apply to the elements inside vp . it follows that wh-words in affective contexts cannot occur in subject position ( specaspp ) as this position is external to vp and therefore not in the scope of existential closure . cheng further argues that all indefinites in mandarin chinese lack inherent quantificational force and must be bound by existential closure . this has the consequence that indefinites cannot occur in subject position unless the aspp is the complement of a modal ( you ' have ' ) which can act as a binder for the indefinite subject . the second half of chapter 4 is taken up with a discussion of the universal quantifier dou ' all ' , which cheng analyses as a quantificational adverb which is base-generated as an asp ' - or v ' - adjunct . at lf , the distributor dou adjoins to its associate . this movement is clause-bound and leaves a trace which must be antecedent-governed . dou is a selective binder and can only license one np at a time , moving to the closest element which can use a trigger . chapter 5 deals with multiple quantification and interactions between wh - and quantifier phrases in mandarin chinese and english . in mandarin chinese scope relations between quantified phrases always reflect their surface order . cheng explains this lack of scope ambiguities as resulting from the fact that neither indefinites nor universally quantified phrases undergo qr . the interpretation of questions which contain universally quantified phrases ( mei - nps ) appears to be sensitive to the presence of the quantificational adverb dou ' all ' . whereas questions which contain a mei - np without dou only have an individual reading , questions with a mei - np which is licensed by dou allow for both an individual and a pair-list reading , cf . ( 4 ) . ( 4 ) mei-ge - ren dou mai-le shenme every - cl - person all buy-asp what ' what did everyone buy ? ' a . what is the thing such that everyone bought ? b . for every x , what is the thing that x bought ? ( = cheng 1997 : 161 , ( 31 ) ) the ambiguity does , however , not result from different scope relations . rather , cheng argues , the pair-list reading is due to a distributive reading of mei - np which is created by its association with the distributor dou . scope reconstruction ( frampton 1990 ) of the wh-phrase to the site of its intermediate ( vp - adjoined ) trace ( which cheng adopts in her analysis of english wh-quantifier interactions ) is not possible in ( 4 ) because dou creates a barrier and the intermediate trace therefore deletes at lf . cheng 's analysis of wh-quantifier interactions in mandarin chinese rests on the assumption that wh-phrases move at lf . she discusses both arguments in favour of lf - movement and aoun and li 's ( 1993 ) claim that in-situ wh-phrases do not move at lf since they can be modified by ' only ' which needs to be associated with an overt element in its c-command domain . cheng argues that wh-phrases which are modified by ' only ' must have a d - linked interpretation and do therefore not constitute evidence against lf - movement . she further notes reinhart 's ( 1990 ) observation that d - linked wh-phrases have to move to be properly interpreted and suggests that such movement takes place at a post - lf level . the chapter concludes with a discussion of the landing site of lf - movement which cheng identifies as speccp ( contra mahajan 1990 ) . comments cheng 's book occupies a place which marks the onset of the minimalist approach to syntactic theory . while she assumes the barriers framework of chomsky ( 1986 ) and uses a disjunctive ecp to derive locality conditions on dou and the lack of scope reconstruction in wh-quantifier interactions , the principle of economy of derivation is central to her argumentation . not only does it prohibit a language from using both strategies for clausal typing , it also accounts for superiority effects in bulgarian ( by forcing movement of the closest wh-phrase to occur first ) , and precludes lf - lowering of indefinite subjects in mandarin chinese ( since there is an alternative derivation which generates a structure with a modal binder ) . moreover , it rules out multiple wh-movement for clausal typing and thus requires cheng to account for multiple fronting languages as resulting from a licensing requirement of the wh-words . as seen earlier , multiple fronting is shown to correlate with the ability of the wh-words to form the morphological base of indefinite nps . however , it appears that not all languages that have indefinites which are derived from wh-words display multiple fronting . german prefixes a wh-word with irgend - 's ome ' to form an indefinite , filling out the whole paradigms of person , place and time , as seen in ( 5 ) . ( 5 ) german wer ' who ' irgendwer 's omeone ' wo ' where ' irgendwo 's omewhere ' wann ' when ' irgendwann 's ometime ' was ' what ' irgendwas 's omething ' moreover , a bare wh-expression can be used as a polarity item in yes-no questions and conditionals , e . g . ( 6 ) - ( 7 ) . ( 6 ) hast du wen angerufen ? have you whom called ' did you call anybody ? ' ( 7 ) wenn du wen anrufen willst , musst du mir bescheid sagen . if you whom call want , must you me let-know ' if you want to call anybody , you must let me know . ' the morphological forms and possible readings of german wh-words thus mirror the situation found with polish wh-words , as described by cheng . german and polish also have in common that neither language has a question particle ( under cheng 's analysis ) and that they must therefore use overt wh-movement for clausal typing . however , whereas polish fulfils cheng 's prediction and fronts all wh-phrases in multiple questions , german can only move one wh-word to clause-initial position , cf ( 8 ) . ( 8 ) a . wer hat wen angerufen ? who has whom called ' who called whom ? ' b . * wer wen hat angerufen ? who whom has called yiddish presents the reverse problem in that it allows for multiple wh-movement but does not derive its indefinites from the wh-words in a morphologically transparent way , cf . ( 9 ) . ( 9 ) ver ' who ' emetser 's omeone ' vu ' where ' ergets ( vu ) 's omewhere ' ven ' when ' a mol 's ometime ' vos ' what ' epes 's omething ' to make things worse , multiple fronting is optional in yiddish . wh - phrases can stay in-situ without necessarily having a d - linked reading , cf . ( 10 ) . ( 10 ) a . ver vemen hot ongeklungen ? who whom has called ' who called whom ? ' b . ver hot ongeklungen vemen ? who has called whom ' who called whom ? ' german and yiddish thus appear to be direct counterexamples to cheng 's analysis of multiple fronting languages . note also in this context that french , often cited as an example of an optional movement language , falls outside cheng 's analysis . as acknowledged in the book ( 1997 : 39 , fn 4 ) , french does not have a question particle and is therefore not an in-situ language . nevertheless it allows for wh-words to remain in-situ in single matrix questions . it might be possible to account for optional wh-movement in french by postulating that french possesses both a non-overt yes-no particle and a non-overt wh-particle . french would then satisfy clausal typing by base-generating a wh-particle in c and all wh-phrases could stay in-situ . movement of a wh-phrase to clause-initial position could be due to another attractor , such as focus , which is not obligatorily present . whatever appeal such an analysis might hold , it points to the problem of allowing for non-overt question particles . while we do not expect to find overt wh-particles in languages without yes-no particles , what will stop us from assuming that a language which allows a wh-word to stay in-situ has a question particle even when there is no ( phonologically ) overt evidence for such a claim ? cheng 's proposal to relate wh-in - situ to the availability of non-overt wh-particles may thus ultimately turn out to be too permissive a theory . another problem arises with cheng 's approach to superiority effects in bulgarian - type languages . as noted , cheng explains superiority effects as violations of the principle of economy of derivation . given that "" adverbs are in the most embedded positions "" ( 1997 : 81 ) , [ adjunct + argument ] orderings are ruled out because movement of the argument is a shorter movement and must therefore take place before the adjunct moves to speccp . however , as observed by boskovic ( 1997 ) , bulgarian questions containing more than two fronted wh-phrases display superiority effects only with respect to the topmost wh-phrase , the others are freely ordered , contrary to the prediction made by cheng 's approach . these comments aside , cheng 's book is to be commended . it is an extremely well written and clearly presented work which should be fully comprehensible even to readers who are not familiar with the literature on mandarin chinese syntax or heim 's ( 1982 ) theory of indefinites . the book is ambitious in its scope , discussing a wide range of languages , and has undoubtedly made an important contribution to the study of wh-movement . references aoun , j . and a . li .

"lg & species the language & species discussion has not recurred this week , but i had already prepared the following , which i think would be of general enough interest to the recurrent misunderstandings about innateness and human language to publish on the list . since my last posting on the language & species discussion i have received some interesting comments and checked on the reference that i had in mind ( since i own a copy ) . the reference is a volume called "" speaking of apes : a critical anthology of two - way communication with man "" . eds . t . a . sebeok & jean umiker - sebeok . ny : plenum press , 1980 . in it is chomsky 's article : "" human language and other semiotic systems . "" pp . 429-40 . chomsky 's article is pretty much as i remembered it , but with a great many other observations on the nature of human language , characteristic of his concept of human language , which contrast / s with what the animal psychologists of the time had taught apes ( and perhaps even thought of teaching them ) , e . g . , potentially infinite embedding of phrases within other phrases . beyond that , he challenges the notion that human language is ( merely / primarily ) a system for ( social ) communication , which serves his notion of the inappropriateness of comparing human language with animal systems of communication for drawing conclusions about the evolution of human language ( and may also imply that it is a strictly human device for interpreting external stimuli and "" thinking "" ) . incidentally , my rereading of the article changed my earlier impression that chomsky lacked "" grace "" in not explicitly acknowledging the accomplishments and discoveries of animal psychologists , to a perception that such explicitness would be irrelevant and distracting to the points he wanted to make . of course he could n't help activating involuntary visceral hostility in some researchers when he accused them of lack of logic in their arguments , but that is another matter . most interesting was his final position that regardless of what apes may prove capable of learning , he saw evidence for a qualitative distinction between the human and ape natural intellectual endowment in the fact that humans acquire most ( syntactic ) properties of language without ( even the possibility of ) explicit teaching , while apes obviously do not , despite the "" evolutionary advantages "" ( c 's phrase ) that it would bestow on them . i particularly liked the last sentence of the following passage : "" now it is difficult to imagine that children learning english receive specific instruction about these matters , or even that they are provided with relevant experience . in fact , we find that while children make many errors in language learning , they never make such mistakes as these : they never assume , until corrected , that "" the candidates wanted me to vote for each other "" means that each candidate wanted me to vote for the other . in fact , relevant experience is never presented for most speakers of english , * just as no pedagogic grammar would ever point out these facts . * "" p . 432 to tell the truth , i do n't get the error in the example ( maybe because i ' ve never been corrected ? ) , but i get the point . it 's the point about anaphoric reference that i mentioned in the last posting ( though i think the passage is trying to rely on some point about syntactic embedding of anaphora of the type common at the time among generativists , cf . the parallel reflexive "" the candidate wanted me to vote for ? him - / herself [ unstressed ] "" ) . in any case , one might argue ( i would not ) that there is an anthropocentric bias inherent in chomsky 's perspective on the "" evolutionary advantage "" of human language - - i would suppose stemming from what i think is the evolutionary tenet that whatever promotes indefinite increase of the population of a species is an evolutionary advantage , since that is supposed to maximise the chance that at least some of the members of the species will survive to continue the reproduction of the species . i guess an objection might be that in some sense apes "" know "" something that we do n't know that makes them shy away from retaining or developing something like human language , e . g . , that the technological advances allowed by human social organization and motivation facilitated by language will eventually lead to our extinction , a notion that would probably have evoked more rhetorical sympathy in the mid 1980s when fear of nuclear holocaust peaked ( or more persistently but less clearly the malthusian notion that uncontrolled human population increase puts dangerous pressure on the ecological support system ) . i doubt such an objection has any chance of being taken seriously ( in the form just given at least ) by the scientific spirit . imagine the unimaginable that some human society ( any human society ) came to this conclusion and rejected human language as ultimately threatening to the species . even so , i would guess that the innateness hypothesis would predict that humans would still not be able to "" help "" learning and manifesting language ( manifesting - - ) learning by future generations ) , and if that would contribute to eventual extinction , too bad . nothing in evolutionary theory prevents "" defective "" aberrations from arising . the species with them would simply arise and then disappear ( relatively quickly ? ) . however , i ' m sure humans are constitutionally incapable of seeing the human language faculty as such an injurious aberration - - i can't . at worst i can only see it as a possible means of salvation from the jeopardy that some of our more sinister instincts may have placed us in . forgive me for even inventing what i consider an idle and repulsive speculation - - but i think it throws in relief what might be inferred in assessing chomsky 's ultimate argument as i understand it . the simple summation of chomsky 's argument is : if apes are capable of learning "" human "" language , why do n't they ( do it naturally - - like people do ) ? probably more interesting and arguable to the list discussion is chomsky 's point of distinguishing "" human language "" and "" language "" . chomsky sees human language as a subject for scientific inquiry with properties which are quite specific , including the syntactic properties of reference , embedding , etc . that we are all familiar with as current linguists . in contrast , my understanding of the article is that he sees "" language "" as a non-scientific concept , something vague and not even promising as a potential scientific field of inquiry . in this vein , he concedes that apes and many other animals may - - in fact , he does not doubt - - make use of symbolic systems ( semiotic systems ) apparently comparable in principle to the lexical component of language in some way , though less extensive , and , if i understand , less discrete ( in the linguistic sense of "" discrete "" ) . and he supposes that such symbolic systems in other animals may be related to shared intellectual capacities of humans and these other animals , but that with humans they interact with distinctive linguistic capacities ( among the latter i suppose the way lexicon fills in more abstract linguistic categories in grammatical derivations ) . in an illustrative passage ( p . 437 ) he objects to the gardners ' characterisation of teaching apes to use ameslan lexical signs as teaching them ameslan as a ( human ) language . by the way , he considers acquisition of the sign for "" and "" as trivial , with respect to comparison with human language . i do n't suppose that that is meant to detract from recognition of the apes ' ability to grasp this "" logical operation "" ( by human definition ) - - but that such recognition is irrelevant to an appreciation of what is distinctive about human language ( well , at least we now know that the "" logical "" concept "" and "" is not distinctive to humans - - the concept "" plural "" , then , probably is n't either - - more problematic is the concept "" dual "" as far as i know - - have apes been taught to count ? hey ! last time i looked i had three identical rubber ducks , now i only have two ! ) . in sum , then , chomsky has a very specific and single-minded notion of human language which allows him to immediately "" see through "" claims about animal manifestations of "" language "" , just as it had earlier allowed him to criticise ( and condemn ) skinner 's notions about the "" nature "" of human language . i think the usual difficulty in seeing his point is not so much in the persistence of linguistic debate about whether and to what extent "" autonomous syntax "" is a valid notion ( let 's not get into that here ) , but in the intuitive notion among linguists , as well as everybody else , that lexicon is a major "" part "" of "" human language "" . it is certainly not the part that chomsky associates with the distinctive innate human faculty of language . rather , the innate faculty is somewhere in the systems which organise combinations of signs , that "" somewhere "" being crucial to whether or not there is an evolutionary discontinuity between human language and animal potentials for "" language "" . of course , another source of resistance to the idea of an innate human language faculty is a generalised sneaking suspicion that anything that proposes to set humans apart from other animals in a fundamental way is self-deluding anthropocentric self - aggrandising propaganda , cf . the discredited ( i think ) argument against the heliocentric theory of the solar system that humans are the "" center "" of creation and therefore their location must be at the pivot of the material universe . while sneaking suspicions are certainly appropriate issues to bring up for something as informal as the ling . list discussion , it is not clear to me how it fits in to more formal scientific argument . misguided as a source of resistance would be the idea floated in the kant / innate discussion that a theory that something is "" innate "" is a killer to further attempts at "" explanation "" . the killer to explanation is the "" just "" in "" that 's just the way things are "" . on the contrary , take out the "" just "" and there would be nothing to explain if there were no "" that 's the way things are "" . if we get confused about this , it 's because , as scientists we don ' t know how things are , and our "" explanations "" are hypotheses to test if things are the way we think they are . i forgot what the context of kant 's discussion of "" explanation "" was , but in the context of "" pure "" reason it would have to be the "" just "" . in "" practical "" reason i suppose whatever aids remembering the "" facts "" is sufficient "" explanation "" . finally , a message from massimo piattelli - palmarini , director of the dept of cognitive science at the istituto san raffaele in milan , alerted me that among the discussion of comparisons between human and ape cognition relevant to language capacity , "" the truly definitive piece is by mark seidenberg and laura petitto in cognition , vol 7 , 1979 , pp . 177-215 . "" although this article was published before the volume i referred to above , it was too recent for most of the papers published in that volume to fully discuss , so that there are only glancing references to it in some of the papers . i still have n't read it yet , not that i ' ve even read most of the articles in the sebeok volume . incidentally , massimo reminded me that apes were indeed found to be able to recognise their reflections in mirrors , monkeys not ( and i think i read that in roger fout 's popular book about teaching apes to communicate with humans which came out in the late 70s ) . from what i gather , animal psychologists etc . are not ( or no longer ) hostile to the idea of a discontinuity between human language and what animals are capable of , but remain ( why not ? ) interested in discovering of what animals are capable of , and what that might suggest about human evolution . benji",Safe Email

you're gonna go to the trouble of packaging custom kernels into rpms,
it's not a far stretch to package the source tree too (as I currently
do).Also, I've found that the alsa-driver source needs a usb-related patch 
to compile under the latest test kernels (2.4.20-preX). Are other 
people seeing the same thing, or is this just a problem with my setup?garyP.S. If I didn't mention it before, thanks for the alsa packages! They 
greatly simplified what used to take way too long before._______________________________________________

""" linguist / - ician "" : a new slant . i have been quite happy so far to sit back and let the discourse about the relative merits of the terms "" linguist "" and "" linguistician "" unfold unhampered by any intervention from me . i am , first and foremost , a lover of language ( s ) ; a person who studies language ( s ) , their history and their "" idiosyncrasies "" . i call myself a "" linguist "" . i might add that i do not myself fully understand the theories propounded by those who call themselves "" linguist [ ician ] s "" ( in the sense of someone engaged in "" linguistics "" , that is ) , nor do i really care what precisely they choose to call themselves ( or their area of study ) . do "" physicists "" and "" physicians "" have the same argument , i wonder ? ! i doubt it . quite coincidentally of this discourse , enid wai - ching mok ( < enid @ uhunix . uhcc . hawaii . edu > ) circulated recently a questionnaire for information on the terms "" linguist "" and "" linguistics "" in various languages . i happened upon an entry in her summary supposedly explaining the two russian terms "" jazykoved "" ( linguist ) and "" jazykoznanie "" ( linguistics ) . these were offered by a certain woody mott also of < uhunix . uhcc . hawaii . edu > : they were so infelicitous in their detail and ill construed in their interpretation that i was impelled to reply to this entry and ( as a "" linguist "" ) correct certain misconceptions . allow me to summarise : notwithstanding the argument whether these words are current or not in russian , i think an explanation of their etymology may be of some use to the general discourse on the merits of "" linguist "" vs . "" linguistician "" . the word "" jazykoved "" is composed of 2 roots : "" jazyk "" , meaning "" tongue "" or "" language "" and "" ved "" , meaning "" knowledgeable person "" ( cognates for "" ved "" ( < old russian "" vedeti "" ( e = the vowel ' jat ' ) ) "" knowing person "" , pace woody mott , are sanskrit "" ve : da "" , gothic "" wait "" , and english "" wit "" ) . the "" - o - "" is here merely a link vowl . a suitable english calque on the russian term , therefore , would be "" tongue-wit "" . this , in turn , reminded me of an article some years ago in which "" saxonist "" terms were advanced in favour of "" latinate "" heresies in the english - speaking world . thus , we have foreword for "" preface "" ( the argument here goes back to 1842 ) ; bodeful for "" ominous "" ; birdlore for "" ornithology "" , etc . , etc . i ' m sure we are bounded only by time and our imaginations as to other suggestions . mindful of the fact that there are probably many among you who are staunch adherents of the "" latinate "" tradition , and not wishing in any way to alienate or belittle that corpus of english vocabulary , i should , nevertherless , like to propose two alternatives to "" linguist "" and "" linguistics "" based on the "" saxonist "" principles above . tongue-wit ( noun ) "" a person versed / skilled in [ the study of ] language ( s ) "" tongue-lore ( noun ) "" the study of language ( s ) "" i leave it to the individual "" linguist [ ician ] "" to choose whether these terms are suited to their own area of study . i think that the "" saxonist "" terms do have the advantage at least of smacking of down - to-earth prurience and a lack of self-importance . a similar term "" tonguester "" , suggested earlier , is an admirable alternative . i for one am quite happy to call myself a "" tongue-wit "" engaged in "" tongue - lore "" - - others , i hope , will follow and leave the "" linguist [ ician ] s "" to sort themselves out . tony hall . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * tony hall * * * department of russian language * * * university of birmingham * * * edgbaston tel : + 44 ( 0 ) 21 414 3227 * * * birmingham b15 2tt fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 21 414 5966 * * * united kingdom email : a . r . hall @ bham . ac . uk * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *",Safe Email

          Learn More
Somatotropin 
                    (aka Growth Factor, hGH, HGH, Growth Hormone, GH, Human Growth 
                    Hormone) is naturally produced by the anterior pituitary gland 
                    in the brain and declines with age, so it is a natural substance 
                    already in your body right this moment. HGH is known as the 
                    master hormone because it exerts effects over all other hormones 
                    in the body, including Testosterone, Estrogen, Progesterone 
                    and DHEA. Augmenting declining somatotropin levels by giving 
                    your body daily ingestible somatotropin, can create a more 
                    youthful hormone balance that results in dramatic improvements 
                    in your health.
                    Â  Somatotropin supplementation 
                    is a life-enhancement. Lives that were once shattered by fatigue, 
                    illness or the ravages of aging, now fourish with the help 
                    of somatotropin supplementation.
                    Â  Somatotropin from the pituitary 
                    works by stimulating protein production in all tissues of 
                    the body. This results in an increase in organ healing and 
                    regeneration, which is associated with increase resistance 
                    to illness and injury.
No matter your age, we GUARANTEE
                    you will look and feel BETTER than
                    you ever imagined possible.

  | Um, my test was to tee to a fifo I didn't read from... resulting
  | in the other reader hanging around forever.... not realising that
  | never-opened-for-reading and opened-and-later-closed might be
  | different. ah!  yes!  this is one of those gotchas everyone stumbles
 over.  the writer of a never-opened-for-reading pipe will
 quickly block (as soon as the pipe's limited buffer fills
 up).  but the writer of opened-and-later-closed pipe gets
 an EPIPE error (and the usually-terminal SIGPIPE signal). the typical stumble is someone creates an anonymous pipe
 with pipe(2), but forgets to close(2) the reader's fd in
 the writer-process (or visa-versa) .... and then wonders
 why the real reader never sees an EOF and/or the writer
 is never gets an EPIPE/SIGPIPE.  various FAQs and many
 books probably discuss this topic in depth to the death.  |             Sensible behaviour has now been observed. good!  and good luck.
cheers,

this hard-to-find information. So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion! 
  Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely

"Sunday I drove from Portland down to the Woodburn Dragstrip to check out 
the NEDRA Nationals. The electric cars, motorcycles and dragsters had some great times and I 
ended up with a few pics and a nice deep burn...John Waylan (who was interviewed in Wired a few years back) pulled out a 
14.4 second run in the quarter mile (91mph), on a battery pack that 
hasn't been broken in yet. He expects to break his record next year 
topping his 13.1sec/99mph run a couple of years ago. He's shooting for a 
12 second run.John also took out a replica 1908 Oldsmobile for a respectable 47mph 
run. (Remember, we started out with electric cars.)Near the end of the day, Kilacycle took the track with an amazing 111mph 
run. Talk about a crotch rocket....Ross...

One drawback : They changed from pspell to aspell apparently, and it
requires aspell >= 0.50 which isn't even in Rawhide, so spell checking is
disabled for now until I take a decision about it :-/If I build recent aspell packages, they may not be upgraded when ungrating
to the next Red Hat Linux release (the final version of the limbos and
(null) betas), which is maybe not really desired. I'll probably test and
see...MatthiasPS: The spec file was massively updated and the --with / --without options
that can be used to rebuild the source packages are now listed in the
description ;-)--

"financial and marketing skills seminar we are not affiliated with any university or college . we are a private business consulting company . the seminar ' s topics are linked together by two overarching business methodologies : i . value - based financial management methodology a . to provide a return on investment ( roi ) to stockholders , management has to continually increase the value of the business , through producing significant profitable annual sales growth , which generates a sufficient level of free cash flow . although , profitability is the necessary condition of a business or a new product , it is not sufficient , because , contrary to conventional business wisdom , profits are not cash . the necessary and sufficient condition of a successful business or a new product is free cash flow , which is the real measure of generated economic value . b . in addition , the free cash flow has to be at a sufficient minimum level to cover the weighted average cost of capital , the risk adjusted cost of capital or the opportunity cost of capital . in other words , before a company can generate a satisfactory level of free cash flow to increase the value of the business , the company has to invest capital and achieve a roi greater than the cost of the capital itself . hence , looking upon a business as a collection of investment projects , for example , investments in new or existing products , new manufacturing equipment , sales programs , information technology software and systems , etc . , the goal has to be to have every investment project generate or save a significant level of free cash flow , and thereby , achieve a sufficient roi . accordingly , every investment project can , and has to be measured on a free cash flow basis . c . to accomplish the above , companies have to measure the correct financial value drivers , with the correct tools . in addition , the companies have to use the same tools to measure all the various types of investment projects , as well as , measuring the business as a whole , and utilize the identical tools employed by professional investors , to assist them in making their investment decisions vis - - vis the company . consequently , companies cannot use standard accounting methods to measure roi , like return on equity ( roe ) or return on assets ( roa ) , which measure substandard value producing activities . additionally , roe and roa cannot be used to measure all the various types of investment projects , and professional investors cannot use them to make successful equity and / or debt investment decisions . ii . value - based product marketing and development methodology a . optimize products and prices between buyers , competitors , and internal financial requirements , using an externally driven development process , that is , 1 ) identify the buyers ' problems , needs , and / or the benefits required by the buyers ; 2 ) determine the value to be delivered to the buyers , with emphasis on incremental value delivered via competitive advantages ; 3 ) set prices based on the value delivered , pricing segments analysis , pricing leverage analysis , pricing strategy and / or the marketing strategy ; and 4 ) determine the product development investment and manufacturing costs that can be justified . b . identify the business value creating market segments , and the product line development sequencing , through the development of a strategic product marketing plan , that identifies the market segments , price segments , optimum prices , product configurations , product development investments , manufacturing costs , targeted marketing and sales programs , and unique product positionings . c . identify the value delivered to the buyers through price segments identification , pricing leverage analysis , competitive value analysis , and classifying features and benefits based on the value they deliver to the buyers , that is , required , persuasive , and preemptive features and benefits , and detrimental , dissuasive , and preemptively dissuasive features . amongst , the specific topics presented are : 1 ) how to identify the value producing market segments for a product , 2 ) how to quickly evaluate new product or business opportunities , before performing a detailed evaluation , and 3 ) why you should , and how to calculate the free cash flow , and the return on investment ( roi ) generated from a new or existing product investment , a marketing or sales program , an information technology system or a manufacturing automation investment . on our web site , we list the major product and financial questions answered in the seminar . these questions are especially informative in respect to the overall content presented in the program . if you or your associates can answer these questions today , don ' t attend the seminar . however , if you or they cannot answer these questions , please register for one of our sessions . this seminar has been extremely well received by over 10 , 000 professionals from large , and small companies . as affirmation , see the letters from sharp electronics , manugistics , advanced micro devices , verizon , sony , ibm , varian associates , mdl information systems , and rise technology . in addition , to marketing and financial professionals , the seminar attracts sales , scientific , manufacturing , and engineering managers , who want to deepen their understanding of the subjects covered . it helps them to design and manufacture value - producing products , and to communicate more effectively with their counterparts in the marketing and financial functions . the seminar provides the participants with real business skills that can be applied to their everyday work tasks . one of the major skills being the ability to think concretely about roi , and to actually calculate it for all types of investments , for example , new or existing products , new manufacturing equipment , sales programs , information technology software and systems , etc . in addition , although , the participants will learn how to evaluate the balance sheet , income and cash flow statements , the financial focus is not on debits and credits or accounting mechanics . the emphasis is on understanding financial objectives and analysis techniques . if you want to improve your or your peoples ability to think as product marketing savvy and financially adroit business people , then please register yourself or them for one of our seminars . we would also be happy to discuss an in - house seminar , either standard or customized , with the associated reduced fee per attendee versus the above fee for our public seminars . we also conduct an all financial version of this seminar called the financial mba seminar . however , we only conduct this seminar as an in - house session . additionally , send us an e - mail , if you would like us to e - mail you an adobe acrobat pdf file containing all the information on our web site . intelligent resources 106 pasatiempo drive santa cruz , ca 95060 this e - mail message is an advertisement and / or solicitation .",Phishing Email

    total unique fn 36This is much closer to what Neil saw, but still looks better.  Another run
on a disjoint 5 random pairs looked much the same; total unique fp rose to
12 and fn fell to 27; on a third run with another set of disjoint 5 random
pairs, likewise, with fp 12 and fn 40.  So I'm pretty confident that it's
not going to matter which random subsets of 500 I take from my data.It's hard to conclude anything given Jeremy's much worse results.  If they
were in line with Neil's results, I'd suspect that I've over-tuned the
algorithm to statistical quirks in my corpora.",Safe Email

I never said that rich people are smart, just less stupid than most
other people.  And most people who are poor do engage in more reckless
and stupid behavior in my experience; the people that are a bit smarter
don't stay poor for long, so it is a self-selecting population.  Hell, I
grew up in as abject a poverty as you can find in the US and I remember
quite well why the people that stayed poor were poor -- it certainly
wasn't because of The Man.  And my parents were poor because they made
lots of stupid choices -- I had front row seats to the whole process. 
Unlike many others, I actually learned from the experience.And I've known a lot of wealthy people (both in a strict monetary sense
and general sense), and I can't think of a one that was a fool. People
who earned their wealth (i.e. 95+% of the wealthy in the US) didn't
manage to do so, and maintain their wealth, because they were fools.  It
isn't that these people are that much smarter, they just don't make lots
of bad decisions and stupid mistakes. Being very smart AND not making
lots of stupid mistakes is pretty much a surefire recipe for being
wealthy.

You are using a very narrow definition of ""smart"".  Smart doesn't make
you rich, it gives you the *choice* to be rich. Many people (e.g.
Stephen Hawking) are quite happy merely being comfortable and devote
their energy elsewhere than being ""rich"".  But I don't know too many
really smart people that actually choose to live in poverty.

It sounds like you've bought into the absurd Hollywood depictions of
what wealthy people are like.  Hint: they are exactly like you and me,
but with a higher net worth.  In the U.S., the fact is that two-thirds
of the millionaires are blue collar folks who worked very smart and very
hard, and the vast majority of all the wealthy in the U.S. are
completely self-made (i.e. first-generation wealthy).  ""Old wealth"" is
incredibly rare in the U.S., as it typically comes and goes within three
generations, and the handful that you do hear about are the unusually
long-lived exceptions.It's quite simple to become wealthy in the U.S. if you put some effort
into it.  However, most people prefer to merely be comfortable and
expend a lot less energy.  Virtually all the people I know who are
wealthy are chronic workaholics with above average intelligence and
exaggerated amounts of drive.  Most people would not consider those
people's lives ""fun"", though those people tend to enjoy what they do.

"affirmative 'd o ' i am working on a construction in a cape town dialect that involves the use of unstressed 'd o ' in affirmative contexts : e . g . ' i did go to the hall yesterday ' . no contrastive pre-supposition is intended ; speakers appear to be simply highlighting a 's alient ' activity ( there are present tense parallels too ) . although this is traditionally believed to be a ' contact ' feature of cape town english , it sounds to me rather like a relic from early modern standard english , reinforced by natural ( second language ) acquisition . the form does occur ( though possibly with different pragmatics ) in child language acquisition ( i have sporadic & unsystematic examples from britain ) ; but is soon weeded out of the grammar . question : does anyone know of any dialect ( any l1 or l2 form of english ; child language , early interlanguage etc . ) that has something similar ? ( i am familiar with early modern standard and earlier forms of 'd o ' ; with affirmative 'd o ' in ireland and the south - west of england - the pragmatics there are different , incidentally : ' habitual ' is not a function associated with the cape town dialect . ) thanks : raj mesthrie dept of linguistics university of cape town raj @ beattie . uct . ac . za",Safe Email
"ijcai95 workshop on context in nlp call for papers ijcai-95 workshop on context in natural language processing august 19 , 20 , or 21 , 1995 montreal , canada correct interpretation of natural language utterances and texts requires linguistic and non-linguistic context . the goal of this workshop is to investigate the nature of context in natural language , its role in natural language processing , and shed some light on this largely unexplored area of great theoretical and practical importance . dialogue and text processing are two application domains where the lack of good theories of context impedes significant progress in applying and developing new technologies . as speech technology matures , it becomes technically feasible to build dialogue systems . however , understanding dialogues , and especially multimodal dialogues , is not possible without some account of the role of context . similarly , with today 's text processing technology it is feasible to automatically create knowledge bases from fairly unconstrained texts such as newspaper archives . ignoring context in such texts , however , results in knowledge bases that are not only very incomplete , but also dramatically different from knowledge bases created by humans , based on the same texts . we invite papers from researchers active in the fields of natural language processing , knowledge representation , and other related areas addressing theoretical aspects of context and their implications for designing practical nlp systems . we are interested in reports on implemented nlp systems utilizing contextual information . we are also interested in knowledge representation systems , inference methods , and algorithms that would allow one to computationally handle specific aspects of context . agenda : our workshop will provide answers and insights into how to go about answering a number of questions , including the following : i : role of context in natural language what is context ? what is "" context of the previous utterance / sentence "" "" context of the dialog-so - far / text-so - far "" and what is the relationship between them ? how many different contexts are there ? what makes two contexts different ? what is the relationship between formalization of context and natural language ideas of context ? what is the status of context in a formal representation aiming at truthfully capturing all the characteristics of natural language ? is context an inherent characteristic of natural language that ultimately decides the formal power of natural language ? is natural language minus context a less powerful formal language ? does representing context and truthfully capturing characteristics of natural language require new knowledge representation or automated reasoning systems ? what is the relationship between context , and the semantics and pragmatics of natural language ? is context different from possible worlds and situations ? what is the relationship between domain ontologies and contexts ? ii : context-dependent interpretation of natural language in which way does context affect interpretation of natural language utterances and texts ? which aspects of context or which contexts result in refined , more general , and different interpretations of natural language ? which aspects of context are explicit and which are implicit in natural language utterances and texts ? which phenomena and inferences observed in natural language are context-independent and which ones always depend on context ? iii : computability does handling context increase or decrease computational complexity of natural language processing ? how to automatically identify context-provided constraints resulting in conveying and understanding additional or different aspects of information ? how to represent those extra constraints provided by context and how to automatically compute context-dependent interpretation of natural language ? should the final interpretation of natural language be decontextualized when stored in a knowledge base ? how can information obtained in one context be utilized in another , possibly unanticipated context ? workshop format : we will hold four sessions : i : role of context in natural language ii : context - dependent interpretation of natural language iii : computability iv : general discussion sessions i , ii , and iii will be mildly structured : first , the committee will present a brief overview of possible answers to the specific questions included in the agenda , and discuss their own answers . this presentation will be mixed with questions from the participants . second , the participants whose papers were accepted will briefly comment on their own answers to these questions . these presentations will also be mixed with questions from the participants . session iv , a general discussion , will give each participant a chance to make a statement about any context-related issue , make a comment , raise a question , argue for or against some answers etc . pre-worshop activities : a pre-workshop mailing list will be established ; please , indicate whether you want to be included ; in order to facilitate interaction and focus the discussion , two months before the workshop , we will provide all the participants with specific examples and data illustrating various aspects of context . authors + titles + abstracts of the accepted papers , but not the papers themselves , will be available on-line to everybody . the papers will only be available to the workshop participants . we hope that this will encourage people to make strong claims even if the support for them is not quite there , report on partial , ongoing , promising research , be frank in evaluating existing approaches and their own accomplishments , openly comment on limitations , in short , say all those ( very ) informative things that are sometimes difficult , if not impossible , to communicate in "" official "" publications . shared data , references , papers and the mailing list are to allow the participants to : - sort out as many as possible things before the workshop - help focusing the workshop discussion on the hardest and most controversial issues - raise objections and bring up controversial claims early on in order to prepare well thought of answers and constructive critique participants : a limited number , 30 or so , active participants will be selected on the basis of submitted papers . a small number , 5 or so , of no-paper - attendance-only participants will also be considered ; such persons should submit a one page research summary and a list of relevant publications . attendees are required to register for the main ijcai-95 conference . schedule / deadlines : very soon mosaic home page for the workshop set 3 . 15 . 95 papers received 4 . 03 . 95 selected papers accepted participants chosen 4 . 05 . 95 acceptance notifications sent to authors sent to ijcai selected papers to be included in the working notes list of confirmed participants request for equipment / room 4 . 15 . 95 mosaic home page for the workshop updated e-mail discussion begins 5 . 01 . 95 distributed to the participants final list of specific issues to be discussed at the workshop references to the existing work on context examples and data illustrating various aspects of context 7 . 15 . 95 final list of participants sent to ijcai 8 . 19 . 95 workshop takes place 12 . 01 . 95 written review of the workshop ready paper format : same as ijcai-95 : 12 pt article latex style 15 pages maximum , including title , abstract , figures , and references the first page must include : title author 's name ( s ) affiliation complete mailing address e-mail address phone / fax number ( s ) abstract of 200 or so words keywords submissions : electronic submissions are strongly preferred : direct : anonymous ftp to ftp . cs . wayne . edu ~ pub / context directory place the postscript or ascii version of your paper , your author + title + abstract ascii file , your references ( bibtex format preferred ) file , and a file with sample data and / or specific examples please , name your files with the name of the first author . for example , john block might place there the following : block . ps a . ps version of his paper block . text an ascii version of his paper if . ps not possible block-a . text an ascii file with authors names , title , and abstract block-r . bbl a bibliography file with references block-e . text an ascii file with sample data and / or specific examples email : lucja @ cs . wayne . edu as the last resort , four hard copies of the paper can be snail mailed to lucja iwanska department of computer science wayne state university detroit , mi 48202 , usa ( 313 ) 577-1667 ( phone ) ( 313 ) 577-2478 ( secretary ) ( 313 ) 577-6868 ( fax ) info about the workshop and the abstracts of the accepted papers is available via a mosaic home page at http : / / www . cs . wayne . edu / context primary contact : should you have any questions or need additional information , please contact lucja iwanska department of computer science wayne state university detroit , mi 48202 lucja @ cs . wayne . edu ( 313 ) 577-1667 ( phone ) ( 313 ) 577-2478 ( secretary ) ( 313 ) 577-6868 ( fax ) program committee : harry c . bunt , kub -

"There are some cases like this with ""incomplete ftoc"".  These are surely old
bugs that appeared after I added the ability to only scan the tail of the ftoc
if for some reason the scan module decides it cannot easily merge the newly
scanned (scan unseen) into the tail of the cached scan listing.  Hmm - I poked
around a bit. glimpse.tcl uses Msg_Change, which has code in it to try and
deal with showing a message that isn't in the ftoc:
        Exmh_Status ""Cannot find msg $msgid - Rescan?""
Is that message hiding in your log?  Perhaps there should be a return from
Msg_Change that glimpse.tcl can use to decide what to do next.>>>Valdis.Kletnieks@vt.edu said:

"This is my Netscape 7.0 Review.o They finally got the email search speed back up to
   where it was in 4.7.x
o Setting up user mail accounts doesn't have that really
   odd, sometimes it lets me sometimes it doesn't problem that
   previous versions had.
o I still have to manually update all my address books by
   hand but at least it lets me import them as Netscape 4.x
   address books (there's not 6.x import as they just assume
   it works--which it doesn't)
o The mail filters are still broken and have the same problem that
   I've tried to report since 4.0.2 where you can't store a mail
   filter of the type: Age in days, is greater than, 21 (or some number)
   Gawd I'd really wish they'd fix that freakin' bug, it's the single
   biggest annoyance that I have with Netscape as it's one of the
   most effective anti-spam tools that I have.
o Webex doesn't support Netscape 7.0 and the plugin doesn't
   work which causes problems when you want to use Webex to
   work on something with someone remotely.I've given up trying to report bugs and any changes to the
source I send always get lost.Greg

"This is preaty neat.- Adam L. ""Duncan"" Beberg
  http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/
  beberg@mithral.comPitch Dark Bar Opens for Blind Dates
Thu Sep 5,10:09 AM ETBERLIN (Reuters) - Diners at Berlin's newest restaurant cannot see what they
are eating and have to be guided to their table by blind waiters because the
bar is pitch black.The restaurant, which opened Wednesday, aims to make guests concentrate on
senses other than sight.Holding on to one another, the first visitors followed waiter Roland
Zimmermann, 33, into the dining room. Although the PhD student has been
blind since childhood, he is the only one able to point out chairs, cutlery
and drinks.""I'm putting your plate right in front of you,"" Zimmermann said. ""I can't
find my mouth,"" one voice replied out of the dark. ""I wonder what this dish
is -- Lasagne? Or some casserole?"" another invisible guest said.In the ""unsicht-Bar,"" which means invisible in German, diners cannot choose
complete dishes from the menu but can only indicate whether they would like
a fish, meat or vegetarian option.""We want people to have an extraordinary experience of tasting, feeling and
smelling,"" said Manfred Scharbach, head of the organization for blind and
sight-restricted people, which is running the bar.""People are surprised that their tongues and taste senses are taking over
and are sending signals, which their eyes would normally have sent,"" he
added.Of the 30 staff, 22 are blind.An average meal lasts about three hours and the waiters are always around to
help, Scharnbach said.And at the end of the night, they will even reveal what customers have
actually been eating.",Safe Email

"**Dublin**: something from the archives. Daev Walsh forwards an article from The Irish Digest about ''Billy in the Bowl''. This story is also immortalised in an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track. Billy was a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I now live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely legal, way to make money.BlogEnd: LinkText: Billy in the BowlFrom: daev Subject: The Case of the Stoneybatter StranglerA story of my new neighbourhood... The Irish Digest July 1964 The Case of the Stoneybatter StranglerThe handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors. Then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes. Many of these beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one who campaigned among the working class. This was ""Billy In The Bowl""The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole means of transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels. Seated in this "" bowl "", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground with wooden plugs, one in each hand.Billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been born without legs. Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing him with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an unusually handsome face.This was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating sympathetic passers-by from their small change.The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century Grangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would come along.He would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his black curly hair, never failed to halt the females. The fact that such a handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.""Billy in the Bowl"", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily owner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were substantial sums of money. The more he managed to get the more he could indulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers. The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening as dusk, was falling. The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing through Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on Dublin's North Quays.When Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a ditch which skirted the lane. As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.Trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay concealed. She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.In a few minutes it was all over. The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his "" bowl "", his victirn's purse snug in his coat pocket. An hour after the robbery the woman was found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her assailant. And, as ""Billy in the Bowl"" had figured, nobody would suspect a deformed beggar.Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting the place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or Stoneybatter.On one occasion "" Billy in ""the Bowl "" tried his tactics on a sturdy servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to strangle her. The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder and caused a great stir.Hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months ""Billy in the Bowl"" was forced to desert his usual haunts. Around this period, Dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first case they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.Months passed and ""Billy in the Bowl"" reverted once again to his old pasttime. A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and robbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a nightly patrol was placed on the district. But the beggar still rolled along in his ""bowl"" pitied and unsuspected. Then came the night that finished Billy's career of crime.Two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment after a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to hear shouts for help. Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the ditch.Billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and tried to pull her into the ditch. She proved much too strong for him, however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.Meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring. Pulling out her large hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.The screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the district and brought people dashing to the scene. Among them was a member of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.""Billy in the Bowl"" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl. The Grangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive Dublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed and giggled as they wended their way home at night.daev_______________________________ Rev.

"energy book hi grant , hope all is well with you . i trust you got my message via the voicemail that ileft with vince late friday afternoon about my inability to travel - i ' m trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of week ' s time when my ear has cleared up , and i look forward to meeting with you one day . i wrote to vince last week asking for a favour , but i ' m not sure ifhe is there in houston . i know that you guys are probably very busy but i was wondering if you can write a few sentences for me . i ' m sending out some sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! ) to my request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please write a sentence or two for your chapter ? i ' m including what i have already written ( although i think it has changed slightly from this version ) so that you can see the style . many thanks and best regards . chris . 2 overview of this book this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book . in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated . chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and trade . chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves . what we do in this chapter chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options . chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model with jumps . chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style options . chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options . chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also discussed . chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market variables .",Safe Email

 | Read Full Story Scripting flaw threatens Web serversA flaw found in newer versions of the PHP Web server scripting language could allow attackers to crash, and in some cases control, computers over the Internet, an open-source developer group announced Monday.
The vulnerability affects versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1 of PHP, according to the PHP Group. The flaw compromises different computer architectures in different ways: Web servers running on Intel IA-32 hardware could crash, while other systems, including Sun Microsystems' Solaris, could allow the attacker to infiltrate the computer.

Russian firm points out new Adobe flawThumbing its nose at the company that landed one of its employees in jail, ElcomSoft is pointing out new flaws in Adobe Systems' eBook software.
The flaws could allow someone to check out every copy of every book in Adobe's new electronic library for an unlimited amount of time by changing the values in the loan form. However, the bugs were discovered on an Adobe test Web site that demonstrates how the software could be used to set up a lending library--not an actual site that offers books--and ElcomSoft gives information about how to fix the flaws.

I agree.  In a way, I signed up just by buying steaks from them.  However, once
I tell them to stop, everything after that is spam.  I told them to stop *many*
times.It's a pity, too, since they have great steaks.  Buying from them is just not
worth having to put up with all of that clinginess.

Date: Not suppliedDaniel Berlinger has noticed[1] that Mac software shops are starting to move to 
OS X-only development. This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people 
who pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small 
fraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people 
who are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn't successful, the Mac is _
over_. It's not like System 9 is getting any more popular. Then again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right 
business decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac 
is not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on 
Netscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share 
of Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) Robb Beal wrote[4]: ""Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company 
with a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it's 
a Mac application a net plus? (No.)"" Well _duh_. Your product would have to 
appeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just 
to break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 
Windows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same 
amount of money. Now, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. 
That's fine. If you like Macs and you're doing it for fun, more power to ya. But as long as we're talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you're going 
to get 25 times as many users. Maybe there's less competition in your category 
on the Mac; maybe you're in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs 
dominate (they don't, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people 
in big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can't sell to mixed 
environments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment 
in Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you're going to overcome that 
magic 25 multiplier.[1] http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/2002/09/10

"your earliest response hang seng bank ltd sai wan ho branch 171 shaukiwan road hong kong . reply to : chepuiiii @ yahoo . com let me start by introducing myself . i am mr . cheung pui director of operations of the hang seng bank ltd , sai wan ho branch . i have a obscured business suggestion for you . before the u . s and iraqi war our client major fadi basem who was with the iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months , with a value of twenty four millions five hundred thousand united state dollars only in my branch . upon maturity several notice was sent to him , even during the war early this year . again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him . we later find out that the major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home . after further investigation it was also discovered that major fadi basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit . and he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank . so , twenty four millions five hundred thousand united state dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it . what bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the hong kong government if nobody applies to claim the funds . against this backdrop , my suggestion to you is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to major fadi basem so that you will be able to receive his funds . what is to be done : i want you to know that i have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful . i have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to major fadi basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your full names and address so that the attorney can commence his job . after you have been made the next of kin , the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you . there is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents . please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue . once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70 % for me , 30 % for you . should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and i will prefers you to reach me on the email address below ( chepuiiii @ yahoo . com ) and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation . your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated . kind regards mr . cheung pui",Phishing Email

"--------------------------------------------------------------------------What is MIME?MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"".  It is the
standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the
world-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sending
images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text
files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part
of the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a
recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. How can I read a MIME message?Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use
which do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing
number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular
MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the
University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host
ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation
capability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do
not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is
still hope! There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME
message.  One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"".  It was developed
at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the
host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions
available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with
older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also
decode messages in split-uuencoded format. Does MIME replace UUENCODE?Yes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so
that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical
limitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust
encoding called ""Base64"" which has been carefully designed to survive the
message transformations made by certain email gateways. How can I learn more about MIME?The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via
anonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including:

"While wandering through Uppsala, Sweden last week, I ran across the
""Keramik"" studio of Paula von Freymann. Her pottery work has the theme of
""fossils for the future"", and she has two main lines of this work. One is
more conventional, taking leaves from plants at the nearby Linneas Gardens
and impressing them into the clay before firing, leaving a ""fossil"" of the
plant.The other is more unique, taking imprints of circuit boards, cellular
telephones, punched cards, etc. and then firing the result to make ""IT
fossils."" Given how quickly most of our work becomes obsolete, I found the
offbeat notion of IT fossilization an oddly fitting way of archiving the
physical detritus of the digital age.http://www.kuai.se/~itart/

""The marine biologists and geologists believe they have shown life could have existed by processing methane without the presence of oxygen. ""Their findings could also prove useful in ridding the earth of excess methane, one of the greenhouse gases many scientists believe is responsible for global warming. ""Traditional views of early life on earth centre on plants which converted carbon dioxide to oxygen. ""'These (plant lifeforms) date back to between three and 3.5 billion years ago... We have found biomass (large cluster of organisms) using methane that geologists show could have existed around four billion years ago,' Professor Antje Boetius, joint author of the study, told Reuters.Link: Yes, she exists. Dr. Antje does more than exist. She gives some kinda publicity shot. Dang! http://www.mpi-bremen.de/deutsch/biogeo/aboetius/aboetius.html http://www.iu-bremen.de/directory/faculty/01063/ ""The two-year research by the scientists from Hamburg University, the Alfred Wegener Institute in northern Bremerhaven and the Max Planck Society centred on coral-forming micro-organisms in the Black Sea at depths where no oxygen and no light is present. ""The Black Sea contains the largest oxygen-free basin in the world. ""The lifeforms were able to process methane together with sulphates within the water, producing carbonates, in the form of coral, as waste. (((Black, oxygen-free ""coral"". I wonder what that stuff looks like. Maybe you could make jewelry out of it.))) ""That they were able to do so without oxygen suggests they may have been around before plant life. ""'Perhaps micro-organisms like those found in the Black Sea were the original inhabitants of the earth during a long period of the earth's history,' said Boetius. (((Yeah, they've just been sitting down there, waiting to save our bacon.))) ""She believes the findings could prove useful for climate control. ""Previously, scientists had thought that methane, found in abundance in the sea and produced through agriculture, could only be broken down with oxygen. ""The German researchers believe the discovery of a pool of organisms that process methane without oxygen could lead to a way of cutting down potentially harmful greenhouse gases without burning oxygen and producing similarly damaging carbon dioxide.

ipchains rules and ipfw rules is quite different. Of course once
you've memorised (not necessarily sitting down with a sheet of them
and learning them off by rote) them, you wonder what all the fuss is
about before.It's not in itself a reason to choose one firewall product over
another, but if that's all there is in the difference, and the
learning curve for the Operating System is the same, then I know
what I'd prefer, as a beginner.This is all getting rather off-topic now anyways, but since I've
been doing quite a lot of work with ipfw over the last week I jumped
on the bandwagon.--

"sum : function words i . the question and its motivation three weeks ago or so , i asked linguist readers to help me find examples of function words with unusually specific meanings . this was meant to elicit examples that i could mention in a paper called "" the formal semantics of grammaticalization "" , where i discuss what happens to the meaning of a content morpheme that develops into a function morpheme . i argue there , developing work by other semanticists / logicians , that ( 1 ) function morphemes do have meanings ( contrary to a widespread assumption ) . just consider that the meanings of quantifiers , tense , aspect , modals , etc . are the bread and butter of us working semanticists . ( 2 ) there is a class of "" logical "" meanings that have certain formal properties ( permutation-invariance , high types ) . ( 3 ) unfortunately , there is no perfect correlation between logical meanings and functional morphemes . there are lexical / content morphemes with ( almost ) logical meanings ( adjectives "" same "" , "" mere "" , "" alleged "" , verbs "" deny "" , "" believe "" , nouns "" majority "" , etc . ) . and there might be functional morphemes with non-logical meanings ( hence the linguist query ) . ( 4 ) thus there is not much that we can say about what happens to the meaning of a morpheme that is becoming grammaticalized . although i make some presumably doomed efforts . the finished paper ( which is based on a talk i gave at the nels 25 workshop on language change ) will appear in the nels 25 proceedings ( to be available from the glsa at umass amherst , glsa @ linguist . umass . edu ) . the paper is downloadable by anonymous ftp from the following url : ftp : / / broca . mit . edu / pub / fintel / gramma . ps i would welcome any comments . ii . some of the responses : mark robert hale ( hale1 @ alcor . concordia . ca ) wrote : ) the reference [ to the pejorative pronouns "" you shit "" ] ) is samuel elbert 's grammar of ) rennellese / bellona , "" echo of a culture : a grammar ) of rennell and bellona "" , uhawaii press 1988 ) [ oceanic linguistics special publication no . 22 ] . ) ) a few interesting cases of ) grammaticalization of a somewhat relevant ) type do exist . in micronesian languages ) there are a set of verbal affixes for ) directionality ( up , down , towards speaker , ) towards hearer , towards some third ) party [ the usual deixis system ] ) which ) also include "" toward the open ocean "" ) and "" toward the lagoon "" ; whereas ( of course ) ) if you want to say "" toward john 's house "" ) ( or some other nonce collocation ) ) you need to use a pp . ) ) similar , but probably not similar enough , ) is the bizarre use of the cardinal directionals ) in icelandic documented in a classic paper ) by einar haugen ( i can dig up the reference ) if you really want it ) . it seems like , being ) predominantly coastal inhabitants , and having ) a rather uneven fjorded coastline , to go ) to a city which was north of you actually ) involved heading out in a southerly ) direction ( all that time ) .

""Promiscuity"" is thus inherently a description of 
distributions rather than averages.Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Let
there be three pairings which result in each person
having sex once. Then, let one of the males also have 
sex with the other two females. Sure, the average number of sex acts and sex partners
is equal between the sexes, tautologically. But here more women than men are:
 - above the single partner threshold
 - above the overall average 1.67 acts/partners threshold
 - above the overall median 1.5 acts/partners
 - above the overall mode 1 acts/partnersAnd here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2) 
number of partners.So in this contrived population, females are more 
""promiscuous"" than males, unless ""promiscuity"" is

"sum : metathesis back in may i posted a query on both linguist and an-lang ( austronesian languages and linguistics ) asking for references on treatments of metathesis using recent phonological theory . i was mainly interested in synchronic metathesis of c / v type , which occurs pervasively in dawan ( w . timor ) which i was doing a bit of work on . this is a summary of responses on both lists , which came from : juliette blevins , bob blust , jim fox , beth hume , greg kinkley , john mccarthy , andy pawley , john stonham , mark taber , and aone van engelenhoven . it turns out that metathesis has come to play a fairly important role in recent discussions of morphological and phonological theory . also more and more examples of metathesis as a synchronic phenomenon have been coming to light in various language descriptions . austronesian languages have provoked considerable interest , with rotuman probably the best known ( e . g . besnier 1987 ) , letinese ( van engelenhoven ) and dawan ( steinhauer , tarno et al . ) becoming better known in the literature , and ( chuck and barabara grimes p . c . ) a number of other languages of eastern indonesia exhibiting varieties of metathesis waiting in the wings for examination by theoreticians ( e . g . christensen and christensen 1992 ; coward 1990 ; coward and coward to appear ; marshall 1991 ; steven 1990 ; taber and taber 1992 - references provided by mark taber ) . metathesis is a relatively rare phenomenon in natural language . in a climate where theoreticians are wanting more and more to let universal principles and constraints explain the output of grammars , it appears to contravene constraints that both phonologists and morphologists would like to impose on languages . an important change suggested in autosegmental theory which was designed to accommodate some crucial instances of metathesis without appealing to movement rules , was the segregation of c and v tiers , applied to rotuman in besnier ( 1987 ) . since then moves have been made to make constraints and their interplay the foundation of theory more directly , and the trend seems to be towards abandoning such devices as tier segregation , at least in optimality theory . in optimality theory , one of the constraints suggested is that segments should preserve their linear order ( linearity : mccarthy 1995 ) . obviously overridden in heavily metathesising languages like dawan . in approaches within optimality theory ( mccarthy , hume ) one principle can dominate another principle , and therefore override it . in c / v metathesising languages , under certain conditions a principle demanding ( morpheme - or word - ) final closed syllables dominates others which would achieve contrary effects , allowing metathesis to occur [ apologies for mangling complex arguments in an attempt at one-line summary ] . another problem raised by metathesis in the realm of morphology is noted by stonham ( 1994 : 141 - 2 ) : "" it defies the use of concatenative accounts of morphological effects . . . it has been called upon as a key example of the need for process - based morphology in such works as anderson ( 1983 , 1992 ) , janda ( 1984 ) and zwicky ( 1988 ) "" . stonham argues to the contrary that difficulties encountered by combinatorial morphology in handling metathesis do not show that the theory is inadequate or processes like movement rules are needed : rather the difficulties reflect the fact that metathesis does not occur as a grammatical marker . he reanalyses several instances of apparent grammatical metathesis as resulting from phonological processes . this approach looks promising , at least for dawan , where much of the metathesis looks as if it could be ultimately prosodically motivated , although i can't prove that right now . although blevins ( 1994 ) is more about such things as vowel length than metathesis directly , the approach , which emphasises looking at metathesis not as an isolated phenomenon , but in the context of a full prosodic analysis , is admirable . such analysis would need to take into account discourse conditioning too , as noted by mark taber for luang . references anderson , stephen r .

a spam hits 5.0.    Any higher does us no good, as it means an FP is
a lot harder to recover from, using compensation rules.Spams *will* hit higher than that -- that's just the way the scoring works.
but for our code to be effective, and spread the range of scores
correctly, we just have to optimise to hit 1 threshold.--j.

>    but let's walk before we run - after all, we may end up
>    all using Zodb in any case :-)I'd like this (despite the additional installation burden - we can ship
binaries for Windows and Mac) and not only for technical reasons.  As I
understand it, post-1.8x versions of the core bsddb code ship under the
Sleepycat license, which demands that projects using it must be
published-source.  This is a problem if we want Spambayes to be fully
PSF-licensed - if someone wants to take the Spambayes source and fund their
addictions by creating a commercial, closed-source spam-filter product, the
PSF license allows that but not if the code relies on bsddb.  Not that I'm
in favour of people making money from Spambayes (unless it's me 8-) but the
PSF license does allow for it - it should be all or nothing.  Or do I have
this all wrong?Slightly OT: This has concerned me since PLabs announced that they were
integrating bsddb into Python 2.3 - it's going to make it very easy
(especially on Windows) for someone to write code that uses anydbm, wrap it
up with Py2exe and ship it under a commercial license, not knowing that
they're breaking the Sleepycat license.  They've never heard of Sleepycat
Software or even bsddb - as far as they're concerned, this ""bsddb.pyd"" file
that Py2exe tells them they need to ship is just another part of Python,
like _socket.pyd or select.pyd.--

">>>>> ""f"" == fork list  writes:    f> ""Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift

    f> socio-political/history buff - does anybody have some clear
    f> examples?China?  Ooops, no wait, scratch that.There is one counter example that I can think of, but it may not be
precisely ""free trade/markets"" -- when Ben Franklin first visited
England he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous.  Ben
explained that they used ""Colonial Script"", a kind of barter-dollar,
and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment.  The
British bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to
clamp down on the practice.  Within a few years, the colonies were
rife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the Empire.According to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political
party here in Canada, the Founding Fathers had no real complaint about
tea taxes, it was the banning of colonial script they were
protesting. If this is true, then it comes right back to the forces
that killed Ned Ludd's followers as to why popular opinion believes
they were protesting a tea tax.  The same pamphlet claimed that Canada
was also a prosperous nation until, by an act of parliament in the
late-50's or early 60's, the right to print money was removed from the
juristiction of parliament and handed over to the Bank of Canada.I've wondered about all this.  Certainly the timeline of the collapse
of the Canadian economy fits the profile, but there are oodles of
other causes (for example, spending money like we had 300M people when
we only had 20M) Anyone have any further information on this?--

"re : 5 . 1196 corpus analysis of - body / - one in my dissertation ( 1993 : a theoretical and descriptive study of epicene pronouns ) i analyzed a corpus of 24 us tv talkshows . i got 16 examples of nps with "" every "" coreferent with a pronoun . the distribution of the nominal element can be found below : 10 - body 3 - one 3 lexical nominal ( s ) the lexical nominals were "" member , "" "" grand jury and trial witness , "" and "" sales person in the store . "" in addition one of the cases with - body was "" everybody involved "" and another was "" everybody else . "" so far this seems to be along the lines discussed by ellen prince and jane edwards . where my data varies is that in every case the coreferent pronoun was they , as was incidently the case with each and no . as far as the analysis is concerned , my results , not just from quantifiers but from nps with other specifiers , indicated that there are various factors at work in the selection of the pronoun , as indeed edwards argues . the following seemed important : notional plurality : obviously the case with every , no , and each . in some cases a singular pronoun is impossible when there is plural semantics and formal singularity , as is well known from studies of quantifier scope . even however when it is structurally possible , the use of singular pronoun can be awkward as prince intuited , though i suspect more than just the nominal element of the compound is involved . in any case , in two out of the three everyone cases was clearly outside the scope , so the plural pronoun was inevitable . in the third case it was in a parenthetical ( from donahue ) and i ' m not sure of the fine points regarding the formal semantics : "" since i do n't know how everyone develops , what their sexual attraction is , you could easily have been into infantilism , or purple handkerchiefs , or same sex experiences "" gender stereotypes : this issue did n't arise with every cases , since all were with they , but in others i found that stereotypically male generic referents ( e . g participant in congressional sex scandals , and lumberjacks ) more frequently received the pronoun he with other types of antecedents . individuation : this is a rather fuzzy , but i think inevitable , semantic category that refers to the degree with which interlocutors are using a referent as an individual versus how that referent is being used as a generic . the fuzziness is necessary because logical real existence does not map into our everyday reference . a personification ( discussed with regards to pronouns by mcconnell - ginet ) is a generic referent treated as if it were an individual . the opposite case , a real person or thing treated as a generic also exists and is discussed with regard to definiteness by talmy givon . i found a couple of cases like this . from a geraldo , the reference is to princess grace : "" how do you fall in love with somebody at a photo opportunity , not see them for eight months and the next time you see them you ' re engaged . "" from a different geraldo : "" i heard , - saw someone run by and they were screaming . "" individuation is clearly the same thing that jane edwards noticed in her point about how singular pronouns are associated with specific people . and similar point was also made by pinker in the language instinct in the chapter on prescription . i found the best analysis of the whole issue can be made by adopting the agreement theory developed by michael barlow in his ' 88 dissertation a situated theory of agreement published last year in the outstanding dissertations series . anybody else have any data ? michael newman dept . of educational theory & practice the ohio state university mnewman @ magnus . acs . ohio-state . edu",Safe Email

"computational linguistics / general and thematic sessions acl ' 99 call for papers 37th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics 20 - - 26 june , 1999 university of maryland [ you may find it easier to read this information on the web at http : / / www . mri . mq . edu . au / conf / acl99 ] 1 . paper sessions 1 . 1 topics of interest in a break with tradition , at this year 's acl conference we are experimenting with a new format . the technical sessions of the conference will be of two kinds . there will be general sessions of the kind that have formed the conference programme in the past ; however , there will also be a number of special thematic sessions , somewhat like a special issue of a journal , organised around themes proposed by members of the computational linguistics community . our aim is to incorporate some of the intensity and excitement of the traditional post-conference workshops , without replacing those workshops . the conference structure will mean that the thematic sessions will run as parallel sessions , resulting in smaller and more focussed audiences . when you submit a paper to the conference , you will need to consider whether you want to present the paper in the general sessions or in one of the thematic sessions , which are listed below . for the general sessions , papers are invited on substantial , original , and unpublished research on all aspects of computational linguistics , including , but not limited to : pragmatics , discourse , semantics , syntax and the lexicon ; phonetics , phonology and morphology ; interpreting and generating spoken and written language ; linguistic , mathematical and psychological models of language ; language-oriented information retrieval and information extraction ; corpus-based language modeling ; machine translation and translation aids ; natural language interfaces and dialogue systems ; approaches to coordinating the linguistic with other modalities in multi-media systems ;

With exmh getting upset by two instances running at the

>   and I assume using a qwerty keyboard is very painful. )I can speak for some Chinese input methods and you can do a hell
of a lot better than a few chars per minute.  For example, the
simplest Chinese IM is Pinyin where you phonetically spell out
each character using the pinyin romanisation rules.  For example,
Zhong Guo (Chinese for China) is entered by typing 'zhong',
then you're prompted with a list of possible matches, with the
most common first in a numbered list, so you hit, say, 2 for
the second in the list, then similarly for 'guo' 3.You can see, that, regarding keystroke counts, it's not that
much different to English.  However, until you get familiar
with the sorting order in the 'possible match' lists, it can
be a little slow.Other input methods are more keystroke-efficient, losing the
phonetic simplicity of Pinyin.  Chinese characters are almost
always pronounced as a first-part-second-part, so zhong is
'zh'-'ong'.  One input method assigns single letters to
the possible first and second parts, so 'i' might represent
'zh' as a first part and 'ong' as a second part, so you'd
enter zhong as 'ii' and a digit to choose from the possible
matches.I think the Microsoft Global IME has a 'stroke' mode where
you can build up a character stroke by stroke, but you'd only
use that when you know the character you want but you don't
know how to pronounce it.>

Input Method Editor uses and what xcin uses IIRC.Regarding the original poster's question - here's what works for me
on Red Hat 7.2o  Make sure the xcin and ttfonts-zh_CN RPMs are installed.  (The
   fonts might not be essential, I think XFree comes with usuable
   Chinese fonts in the XFree86-fonts RPMso  Select Chinese (Simplified) as the language in GDM when logging
   in.Everything should 'just work'.  If you've got the default clock in
your GNOME panel, you should now see it in Chinese.  A lot of the
menus will also be in Chinese, but you should be able to find your
way around.Use Ctrl-Space to toggle between Chinese and English input.  When 
in Chinese mode Shift-Space toggles between something that I don't
understand, but it blocks exiting to English.  So if you can't use
Ctrl-Space to get back to English, try hitting Shift-Space, Ctrl-Space.Fire up a GNOME terminal.  In Chinese mode, type zhong 1 guo 1 and 
you'll see the Chinese for China.Getting this to work while selecting English at the GDM screen is left
as an exercise for the reader.  Looking at /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/xinput
and /usr/share/doc/xcin should give enough info.Later,

IM client vulnerable to attack James Pearce, ZDNet Australia  Users of messenger client Trillian are vulnerable to attack, according to
information security analyst John Hennessy.Hennessy has published a proof-of-concept showing the latest version of
Trillian, v0.73, is vulnerable to a buffer-overflow attack that will
allow individuals with malicious intent to run any program on the
computer.Trillion is a piece of software that allows you to connect to ICQ, AOL
Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger and IRC with a single
interface, despite some companies actively avoiding messenger
interoperability.According to Jason Ross, senior analyst at amr interactive, in June 2002
there were 28,000 home users of Trillian in Australia, about 0.4 percent
of the Internet population, and 55,000 people using it at work, about 1.8
percent of the Internet population.David Banes, regional manager of Symantec security response, told ZDNet
Australia the code appeared to be valid.""With these sort of things you have to find some process that would
accept a connection, then throw loads of random data at it and get it to
crash,"" he said. ""Once it's crashed, you can try to find a way to exploit
it.""He said the proof-of-concept that was published is designed to run on
Notepad, but could be easily modified to run any program on the system.
He said the problem was easy to fix by ""writing protective code around
that particular piece to more closely validate the data around that
piece.""""Because people are pushed for productivity you tend to leave out the
checks and balances you should put in, which is why we have all these
buffer overflows and exploits out there now,"" said Banes.Cerulean Studios, creator of Trillian, was contacted for comment but had
not responded by the time of publication.------------------------------------------------------------------------For all security-related news, including updates on the latest viruses,

A lot of spam which *appears* to originate from China, and even 
a lot which advertises websites hosted there, is sent by, and is 
done for the benefit of, companies based in the US.  The spam 
often appears to originate there because it's coming from open 
http, or squid proxy servers.  It's hosted there because these 
spammers are now persona-non-grata on all US ISPs.  One hardly 
needs to involve the Chinese government in a case where a US 
citizen is violating US law.

>    cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc.Surprising then, how much information you can find on the 
current whereabouts of long-time spammers like Alan Ralksy of 
Detroit, Michigan.  Ralsky is a guy who even gives interviews to 
the news media.  If you can connect a specific corpus of spam to 
him, his street address is well known. Ralsky is a prime 
candidate for lawsuits in any state with an anti-spam law. 
Thomas Cowles is another long-time spammer, but last I heard 
he'd been jailed for stealing computer equipment from his 
business partner, Eddy Marin (also a long time spammer (You've 
heard of PopLaunch, right?)>  - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!  I

pump-and-dump spammer, Rodona Garst.  Seems she had an open 
file-share on her laptop, and when she forged the wrong domain, 
the real owner hacked in and posted all her private information 
on a website. Oh, look, it's still there, including the nude 
photos:http://belps.freewebsites.com/I recall this well, because the SEC was VERY interested in 
confirming the validity of the information found online.  There 
were some ""interesting"" conversations. This summer, the SEC 
released the following:http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htmYes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty 
for operating a pump-and-dump scam isn't small.  The wheels of 
government grind slow, but the grind very fine indeed.--B-------------------------------------------------------

"whatever happened to 'd ? dear subscribers , recently i came across an example of better used without had in the following construction : she better stop . as it was an american publication , i assumed that the use of had in such expressions had completely disappeared , in written as well as spoken us english . i would not have been surprised to find that it had disappeared from spoken usage , since there are obvious phonological reasons , but the loss of it in writing indicated to me that the use of better alone was quite standardised . this poses a question for me , and i was wondering if anyone out there has a suggestion . if it is now standardised , and there is no longer a had , why does n't the former bare infinitive stop now become finite and take 3ps inflection ( ? she better stops ) ? is this because it now has assumed a subjunctive-like quality ? can it then be associated with the expression : it is better that she stop ? if so , can another adjective be substituted for better here , e . g . it is good that she stop ) ? ? she good stop ? how has this been reanalysed , and what are the implications ? ( susan dopke informs me that some grammarians have interpreted better in these contexts as an auxiliary , and if that is the case , can we use sub-aux inversion to make it a question ? ( ? better she stop ? ) is this now acceptable too ? please send your suggestions if this bothers you . debbie ziegeler",Safe Email

"With enough warning, you might not even care about trying to divert 
the meteor -- you'd divert the Earth instead.I recall reading many years ago about calculations, done separately
both by US and USSR scientists for different reasons, about the
effect of nuclear explosions on the moon's mass, and thus its orbit,
and thus also (over time) the Earth's path around the sun.I believe the conclusion was that mild changes in the moon's 
composition would have the effect, over several years, of changing 
significantly where the Earth would be at any certain future point. Voila! No collision -- at least not with the initial threat. And
no need to travel out to anywhere near the meteor, either. Just

Date: 2002-10-06T21:28:33-06:00Ted Rall: My Government Went to Afghanistan and All I Got Was This Stupid 
Pipeline[1] Summary: The US begun planning courting the Taliban for permission to build an 
oil pipeline since 1997. We even flew Mullah Omar to Texas to try and convince 
him. After it was clear that wouldn't work, we threatened to bomb them and 
begun attacking on a smaller scale for a year before 9-11. We already planned 
to invade two months before the attacks. While it's not clear they knew about 
9-11 it certainly provided a convenient cover for their plans. Three days after we started bombing, we begun official work on the pipeline 
Karzai, the Afghanistan president we installed (who incidentally used to work 
for the oil company Unocal and was a former Talib) focused on the pipeline 
rather than rebuilding his torn country. Yet, the entire pipeline is unworkable 
because it's too expensive and will be sabotaged by warlords and Pakistan. Bin Laden was essentially a venture capitalist: he funded attacks but didn't 
carry them out. It's far more likely that an Egyptian group, Islamic Jihad, 
carried out the attacks. If we wanted to stop the terrorists, we should have 
gone after them. If we wanted to stop anti-Americanism, we should have gone 
after Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Instead, our bombing created the perfect 
opportunity for Bin Laden to escape. Nor did we bother to stabilize 
Afghanistan, the country is as ruined as ever. ""Unfortunately, our government seized the moment as well, not to do good or 
right, but to take advantage--of our grief, of our naivete, of our lust for 
justice and vengeance. They did it to line the pockets of themselves and their 
friends, to gain political and economic advantage for a tiny coterie of 
influential people. In doing so, they endangered the rest of us. They took 
advantage of our ignorance about Islam, Caspian Sea oil and remote Central 
Asia. I have faith that the fundamental goodness of the American people will 
cause them to see what was done in their name, and to do something about it.""[1] http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/pipeline0.html

air travel - air transportation is the single largest component in the travel mix . in recognition of this fact , a number of significant discounts have been negotiated with all of the major carriers . there are two separate channels available to employees to access the enron - negotiated fares . the first is travel agency in the park ( "" tap "" ) , or the gss - approved preferred travel agency for your location , and the second is the new enron - managed online travel booking service , clicktrip , located at . over the coming weeks , gss will be promoting training and usage of clicktrip , as the primary method of booking domestic u . s . travel for a number of reasons . first , excluding proprietary carriers like southwest airlines , clicktrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options for their destination , including the enron - negotiated fares . second , industry data shows that employees will generally make the most cost - effective travel decision when presented with the relevant facts . conservatively speaking , we estimate that a 20 % savings in airfare is attainable through the use of this tool alone . third , it is relatively painless to use . fourth , clicktrip is accessible 24 x 7 from any internet - enabled personal computer and after - hours telephone support is available . if you have travel - related questions , please contact tracy ramsey at ext . 6 - 8311 . one final air travel reminder worth promoting : for employees who fly in the united states , use of non - refundable coach tickets generally runs 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $ 100 fee . ? lodging and car rental - gss has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate your business unit ' s individual hotel policy . additionally , preferred car rental rates including insurance coverage with national ( u . s . and canada ) and alamo ( u . s . ) have been negotiated for your use . more detailed information is available regarding both programs through our travel site located at . enron industrial markets - forest products eim began trading in the physical markets for forest products ( newsprint , pulp , recycled paper , and lumber ) in august , 2000 and steel in january , 2001 . since then eim has handled over 140 , 000 tons of recycled paper , 180 , 000 tons of newsprint , 150 , 000 tons of pulp , 160 million board feet of lumber , and 210 , 000 tons of steel . currently on a weekly basis , eim is moving approximately 20 , 000 tons of forest products ( newsprint , pulp and recycled paper ) , 3 million board feet of lumber , and 10 , 000 tons of steel products throughout the world . due to much larger volumes of forward trading , eim is expanding its physical product delivery capabilities around the world to physically handle 5 million tons per year . the eim logistics group coordinates the activities of customer service , supply and demand matching , scheduling of owned assets , and physical transport and warehousing . these activities are primarily coordinated through the houston office , with additional resources in london and singapore . additionally , eim owns paper mills in quebec city and new jersey which have a combined production capacity of 750 , 000 tons of newsprint per month , and a cold rolling steel mill in arkansas with capacity of 400 , 000 tons per year . each of these facilities includes logistics resources that are coordinated through the eim logistics group . enron global markets - lng enron global lng has enhanced its atlantic basin lng supply portfolio with volumes from nigeria lng limited ( nlng ) . enron global lng recently signed a memorandum of understanding with nlng for delivery of 1 bcm / year ( billion cubic meters ) or ( 97 , 000 mcf / day ) from the nlng plus project . this is a two train expansion of nlng ' s existing bonny island lng production facility . the expansion is scheduled for completion in 2005 . this deal represents a major step in the establishment of enron ' s global lng network . egm - finance & structuring on june 29 , 2001 , enron global markets - lng group successfully completed the divestiture of its 100 % equity interest in progasco , to chdr , inc . via an all cash transaction . progasco sells and distributes lpg to commercial and industrial clients , and independent resellers , through a fleet of tanker trucks , bobtail trucks and 13 filling plants throughout puerto rico . chdr , inc . is the record and beneficial owner of all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of tropigas de puerto rico , inc . ( "" tropigas "" ) . upon completion of this transaction , tropigas , hitherto the 3 rd largest market player will operate the newly consolidated entity and control a 35 % market share , becoming the 2 nd largest puerto rican lpg marketer . the sale proceeds of approximately $ 14 . 3 million , have been split between protane ( a wholly owned enron corp . delaware subsidiary ) and san juan gas ( sjg ) , and were used to pay down inter - company debt owed to sjg and pro caribe . the net ( pre - tax ) gain recorded on the transaction was $ 3 . 9 million . the profitable sale of this strategic asset allows egm to exit the retail propane business it inherited through the 1985 merger of three companies : protane , petrolane and imperial gas , and will enable enron to better deploy the cash received and more efficiently manage its puerto rican human resources . egm -

notably , on the wholesale side , the continental , uk and nordic power and gas teams keep going from strength to strength as we see exceptional growth in volumes and transactions continue this quarter . total physical and financial settled volumes for gas and power in europe have seen an increase of 172 % in the first six months of the year compared to the first six months in 2000 and the total number of transactions per day has risen to 604 from 272 last year . specifically , uk power volumes are up 204 % to 147 twh in the first six months of 2001 from 48 twh in the same period last year . continental gas volumes have grown from 351 bbtue / day in 2000 to 1 , 390 bbtue / day in 2001 - a 296 % increase - and continental power volumes have seen growth of 360 % with volumes rising from 18 twh in the first six months of 2000 to 83 twh for the same period this year . the growth in volumes is not simply limited to the uk and continental markets , however , as nordic power volumes have increased by 153 % from 29 twh to 73 twh in the first half of 2001 . the success stories are not just limited to gas and power trading , however , and abound throughout the business : enron energy services the retail business has experienced a real boost this quarter with the closing of ees ' first , major "" marquis "" brand energy outsourcing transaction with supermarket giant , j . sainsbury plc . of equal importance , enron direct ' s business continues to grow with total customers now in excess of 160 , 000 . the success of enron direct ' s business model has translated into the development of new business on the continent in the netherlands and spain and , more recently in north america , with the 2 nd quarter opening of enron direct canada . enron credit a year after enron credit ' s launch , the total life to date notional value of transactions has surpassed $ 11 . 8 billion and in the 2 nd quarter alone , enron credit generated $ 10 . 4 million in ebit . further , more than 20 , 000 readers per week view the enron cost of credit ( ecc ) through independent publications . enron australia with 2 nd quarter power volumes up 177 % from the first three months this year , enron australia is gearing up for a strong growth year . with the development of a physical power position key to expanding enron ' s power trading in australia , work began this quarter to identify and begin the initial pursuit of asset development projects . other businesses undergoing significant expansion this quarter were coal , renewable energy credits and weather derivatives . spain : arcos the arcos asset development project in spain continues to make great progress with third party access to gas supplies for the power project being successfully negotiated this quarter , plus the project achieved another milestone in the permit / government approvals arena with the granting of its water concession in q 2 . uk : etol etol , a long - standing contributor to enron europe ' s earnings , generated yet another profitable transaction this quarter with the signing of a series of deals with chemical giant du pont for supplies at wilton international . the transaction further strengthens enron ' s relationship with du pont , one of etol ' s largest customers , and will extend the current steam and power supply contract through 2010 . enron metals a year after entering the metals business , enron metals has seen increased volumes of 130 % in its merchant and financial trading operations this quarter with volumes up to over 3 . 5 million tonnes as compared to just over 1 . 5 million tonnes in the 2 nd quarter last year . not only has the team seen positive growth in volumes this quarter , but they have increased their share of trading on the lme by 50 % and are making significant progress with project salem - a major it and systems improvement project that will streamline deal capture and risk management for metals transactions . finally , the metals team achieved a true home run this quarter when they closed a major ten - year origination transaction that , through the addition of smelting assets , will enable the metals team to improve its trading position . the transaction proved to be the perfect opportunity to leverage all of enron ' s trading and origination capabilities and involved input from a number of groups across enron . looking to the future , we have every expectation that the strong growth we ' ve witnessed in europe for the first half of the year will continue through end 2001 . so , in the words of solomon smith barney analyst , ray niles , when talking about enron ' s european wholesale operations results this quarter , "" europe is kicking butt and it ' s about a quarter of [ enron ' s ] activity , nearly double what it was last year . and , that is a new market that is the size of the us .

"western issues update 8 / 3 / 01 aluminum smelters ( dsi ' s ) alcoa aluminum there are no new developments in the alcoa - bc hydro talks to provide the aluminum producer a source of cheap , stable energy . alcoa is still shopping around to find a good seller , since the load reduction agreement with bpa is still in effect . it should be noted that bc ' s premier , gordon campbell , has had long - standing poor relations with alcan , inc . of canada , a competitor of alcoa ' s . while in the opposition , campbell helped to scuttle a completion deal that would have allowed alcan to finish a $ 1 . 3 b hydroelectric power project . earlier this year , bc hydro considered a plan to refund alcan some money for an energy buy - back deal similar to the load reduction agreements south of the border . if campbell can move to secure an aluminum partner he does not have a problem with , he will likely do so - to that end , look for alcoa and bc hydro talks to be productive if the premier has anything to say about it . alcoa is still in talks with bpa on potential continued load reduction agreements . in a recent shareholder meeting last week , alcoa ' s management was peppered with questions from wall street fund managers regarding the bpa talks - the feeling in the sector is that aluminum prices have begun to bottom out , and the impetus is now to start rebuilding production in the pacific northwest and re - establishing revenue growth . kaiser aluminum with the hiring of harvey perry as the company ' s new aluminum chief , kaiser ' s long - term aluminum strategy still remains somewhat unclear . as the only dsi to not have signed a load curtailment agreement with bpa , they are still in discussions . if anything new arises , we will keep you updated . bc hydro bc government campbell ' s government will be moving swiftly on the heels of the house bill to approve anwr drilling to fast track the lifting of the moratorium on offshore oil and natural gas exploration . some of the communities in northern british columbia , such as fort . st . john , dawson creek , black gold and fort mcmurray , have had significant recent population booms , and they are poised to hit critical mass as oil company money rolls into the region . currently there is debate about how to structure and site the pipeline that will run from anwr through british columbia . significant oil company exploration royalties will flow into local tax base coffers , which will make the offshore drilling an extremely competitive business between bc and alaska . bc hydro hydro officials are in the process of officially courting new partners and are becoming more aggressive in their attempts to find energy buyers . due to its ability to generate cheap hydroelectric power , bc hydro is looking to be competitive player in the market - avoiding its traditional subsidy of the "" jobs for power "" program , and pursuing lucrative cross - border contracts with us firms . at the same time , hydro will be moving to slice community programs ( anywhere from $ 6 to $ 8 million ) and outsourcing its information technology departments for savings in the $ 20 - $ 25 million range . bc hydro , whose annual revenues hover typically around $ 300 million , is looking at early mini - budget estimates for 2001 to be in the $ 375 million range . its trading subsidiary , powerex , has not come back with a refund counteroffer to california , and it looks like ca will have to take this issue to court . bc hydro is in the process of selecting its new chair of the board , which is looking more and more likely to be larry bell , from campbell ' s transition team . we have yet to pin down the name of the second candidate , although we believe he is a vice - president at west coast energy . the selection will not likely occur for another two weeks , so we do not anticipate any major policy shifts until late october or november . in the meantime , campbell and gary collins ( the finance minister ) will be calling the shots on hydro ' s future . keep in mind that the minister of energy and mines , neufeld , has the official title , but his power has been greatly curbed by the premier - the administration will be playing it safe until they feel they have a few knowledgeable players on board who are receptive to their agenda . bonneville power administration financial solvency after having a chance to speak with a source close to sen . patty murray ' s ( d - wa ) office , it has become apparent that the energy and water appropriations bill to provide bpa an additional $ 2 billion in borrowing authority ( over the $ 3 . 75 billion of existing authority it already has ) may be scuttled . sen . murray has been fighting a provision in that bill which would have forced bpa to come back to the senate every year for review - the white house , the senate appropriations committee , omb and the budget committee have all been opposed to the entire bill . the feeling is that if the $ 2 billion of additional authority would be issued , the money would be coming off the back of social security and medicare . eight northwest senators will be convening on this issue over the course of the next month and a half . the next time this issue will come up again is the middle of september , when there is another energy bill conference . obviously , now that bush ' s energy bill has passed the house , they will be looking to bring considerable pressure on democratic senators to pass the legislation - we would not be surprised if a deal to extend bpa borrowing authority is linked with support for anwr drilling . spill issues the $ 5 million spill over two columbia river dams a few short weeks after bpa administrator steve wright said there would be no summer spills was very likely a political bone for the environmental groups . fish managers , notably critfc ' s bob heinith and odfw ' s christine mallette , had stumped hard for any spill at all being better than none , but they lacked survival data to show that it would benefit fish in this extremely low flow year . power operators and the corps of engineers questioned the models used to determine the value of the spill , citing the impact of adverse tailwater conditions from low flows being compounded by spilling water , making it extra hard for juvenile fish to leave the area below the dams , and hence suffer higher mortality from predators like the northern pike - minnow . dam breaching congressman jim mcdermott ( d - wa ) recently announced that he was introducing a bill that would pave the way for breaching the four lower snake dams . it would also call for another study on the economic effects of breaching and authorize the corps of engineers to "" partially remove "" the dams if the secretary of commerce finds it necessary to satisfy esa , clean water act or tribal treaty obligations . "" the bush administration has so far failed to allocate funds to implement the 2000 salmon recovery plan to avoid dam removal , "" mcdermott said in a july 19 press release . "" if this bill nudges them to take the plan seriously , and it is successful in preventing the breaching of the dams , then no one would be happier than i would , "" he said . "" now is the time to plan for all contingencies . "" co - sponsored by tom petri ( r - wi ) and 19 other representatives - - but no others from the northwest - - the bill will have difficulty getting out of committee , where opposition has massed quickly , led by butch otter ( r - id ) and doc hastings ( r - wa ) . the two issued "" dear colleague "" letters asking fellow members not to support mcdermott ' s bill . pacific northwest utilities and energy interests have battled long and hard with salmon environmentalists over the issue with dam breaching . the environmentalists took their lumps earlier this year when energy prices shot up and left them nowhere to run politically . now that energy prices have come down again , they will continue to beat their drum over salmon preservation - although they are much weakened now . forestry issues forest fires one of the largest forest fires in the pacific northwest , the thirty mile fire , which claimed the lives of four firefighters , is under control this week . the only other major fire in this region currently is the 4 , 800 - acre union valley fire in southeast washington state . the fire is three and a half miles north of chelan , wa , and evacuations of residences continue in upper union valley and in washington creek drainage . the fire continues to spread north into washington creek drainage . burnout operations on the northeast flank of the fire were successfully completed . we have not seen any reports of this fire disrupting any electrical lines or significantly hampering transmission .",Safe Email

"re : risk metrics i completely agree with you . nevertheless , i am sorry if i did not make myself clear when we talked about this last tuesday : i am not advocating penalizing business units because of their lweek rovars or sharpes . i would certainly not set traders ' bonuses based on these numbers ( nor do i think anyone at enron would consider doing that ) . enron focuses on long term profit and risk . however , the long term is made up of many short terms , and catastrophes can occur if a company ' s management does not pay close attention to the latter . indeed , enron management is very interested in short term profitability ( they want to be notified of very large 1 and 5 day losses ) and short term risk ( we report daily var limit violations ) . in this spirit , i am simply offering 1 and 4 week rovars and sharpes as something interesting and useful that we can now produce from the dpr database , and i will let upper management use or ignore them as they see fit . regards , eugenio naveen andrews @ enron 09 / 08 / 2000 11 : 13 am to : eugenio perez / hou / ect @ ect cc : ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : risk metrics eugenio , in regard to your recent e - mail concerning rovar , sharpe and other risk metrics , and our meeting on tuesday , it is imperative to understand that ( 1 ) while p & l is a number one can aggregate on a daily basis , var numbers on 1 - week or 4 - week basis , and consequently rovar numbers , are not meaningful operationally ( ie , trading activity and senior management decision - making ) and statistically . rovar and sharpe were designed to measure business unit performance over extended time periods ( preferably a year ) . specifically , you cannot penalize , or make reasonable business decisions about a unit , because of their 1 - week rovar or sharpe . ( 2 ) significant trading activity at ene is composed of long - term strategic trades ( seasonal plays with durations of over 6 months , perhaps ) , wherein desk heads and senior management have an intuitive feeling for their rovar ( over 6 months ) . a 1 - week or 4 - week "" interim "" number in this case is not useful . traders might purposefully want to make a certain 1 - week or 4 - week rovar low in their trading activity if they believe their 6 - month number can be high . in such a case , a 1 - week number might send dangerous messages to senior management . ( 3 ) conceptually , p & l and var , in isolation , are numbers which are sound and rigourously calculated . the ratio , however , one has to be careful about . the numerator ( cumulative p & l over a certain period ) can be aggregated by simple arithmetic summation , no problems . however , the denominator ( average daily var over a certain period ) relies on the underlying assumption that each point in your time series is independent and correlationless . to get a sufficient statistic for the denominator , one would have to take a large sample in your series ( 6 months or more ) , for a daily average var number to be meaningful , statistically . ( 4 ) the rac group has instituted similar metrics which have been in usage for over two years . the numbers are shown to the b . o . d with the express intent of comaring business unit performance on a 6 - month or yearly tenor . please contact matthew adams ( rac ) or myself to make sure that we are on the same footing regarding the actual calculation of such metrics . also , in the future , just to be consistent and on - the - same - page , please contact me or mr . adams if any risk - related numbers are to be showcased in a public forum . ( 5 ) finally , as you can probably corroborate , senior management might not be fully versed on the nuances of var , let alone 1 - week var ratios . therefore , one has to be wary of the misuse of ratios and risk metrics . i liked your presentation of your database on tuesday . i think it is a nice step in aggregating and dissecting p & l from disparate sources . best regards naveen",Safe Email

"comparative method and geoff pullum i have a problem : geoff 's posting sounds like it assumes ( a ) that there are only two sides to the issues under discussion and ( b ) that one of them is "" orthodox "" and the other one ( the i am on , apparently ) little short of crazy , the suggestion being that those who defend the idea that there are linguistic relationships to be discovered beyond the ones which were known in 1840 or some such cut-off date ( the so-called "" remote "" or "" distant "" connections ) might go so far as to accept that all of greenberg 's muskogean data are wrong and yet to maintain that muskogean is amerind ( without citing any new data ! ) . i think the reality is quite different . for example , victor golla , karl teeter , and i ( although we have been debating some methodological issues relevant to nostratic ) are actually very close on most issues ( except the ones under discussion , apparently ) and in particular on most issues concerning the proposed amerind grouping . there are lots of historical linguists with different ( and crossclassifying ! ! ) views on these matters ( for example , eric hamp has been widely quoted on his views against nostratic , yet he has been a staunch defender of altaic and of a connection between luoravetlan and eskimo - aleutian ; many of those who like nostratic do not like amerind ; and so on . i think each case deserves to be examined on its merits , the whole idea of contrasting "" orthodox "" ( or "" mainstream "" ) with "" remote "" or "" distant "" comparisons is without foundation and can lead to further needless polarization , and finally i feel that methodological issues and substantive ones should be discussed separately ( and that the latter are the more important , even if the former are often the more seductive ) . and to close on a positive note ( consonant with the spirit of the season ) , if karl teeter and i can reach the point where our major remaining disagreements are ( a ) whether in principle one could or could not write a comparative grammar of anglo - french , and ( b ) whether in fact the work done to date on nostratic is sufficient to taking it as a working hypothesis that at least indo - european , uralic , altaic , kartvelian , and afro - asiatic are related and going further , then i think we have achieved considerable progress ( and i am not even sure we even disagree about these points any more , for as the discussion goes on , more and more mutual misunderstandings seem to disappear ) . there will , of course , remain a lot of hard work to be done , on these and even more on other language families , but i do not see why the inevitable disagreements should be considered any more of a problem than the disagreements within the indo - europeanist community about the different versions of the laryngeal theory or about the glottalic theory , etc .",Safe Email

"Gooday,With warm heart my friend, I send you my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity. I have kept it to myself for a long time, and now I need to act, as time is not on my side. I want you to open-heartedly read through and give me your most needed support. I got your address from an internet directory, in my search for a contact. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance. My name is Donald Phiri, the farm supervisor and personal assistant to Mr. David Stevens, a very popular and rich farmer from Macheke, Zimbabwe. My master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of April 2001, due to the land dispute and political situation in my country, as a result of my master's financial support for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), the main opposition party to President Mugabe's party,  Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) . For more information on my master's murder, you may check the Amnesty International Country Report on Zimbabwe for the year 2001.When the pressure on white farmers started in Zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by President Mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers, my master forsaw the danger ahead, he then closed his major bank accounts, and together, we went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of $14.5 million (Fourten million, five hundred thousand USdollars), in a private security company, for safety. This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana. He has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from Europe. My master is divorced, and his wife Valerie, and only child, Diana have relocated to Bradford, !
 En!
gland for 9years now. I am currently in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. I have now decided to transfer my  master's  money into an account for security and safety reasons. This is why I am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left. You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you.If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the Netherlands, and then we will transfer the money into an account. You may open a new account for this purpose. I have applied to the security company to transfer the box from South Africa to their branch here, which they have done. To legally process the claim of the box, I will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative, and deliver the box to you. I have with me, the certificate used to deposit the box, which we will need for claiming the box. For valuable assistance, I am offering you 10%($1,450,000) of the total money. I have also set aside 1%($145,000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%($580,000), will be given to Charity in my master's name I will give 25% ($3,625,000) to Valerie and Diana, after my share of the money has been transfered back to me. When they grant my asylum application, my share of the money (85%), will be transfered back to me, into an account I will solely own. I also intend to start up a business then. If you have knowledge of farming business in your country, or other areas of possible business investment that I may be interested in, please inform me, so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being.Please, I want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction. I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you.Yours sincerely,
Donald Phiri.

particular it has to work with what they've already got, and it has to
work on client's systems.My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on
Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.
They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a
service pack.  Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to
run C programs.

in a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be
10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable
libraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.
At least that is the case when then language you used is available on
the target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.

>6.  Hardware is getting so fast that I'm not sure if the performance

time out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could
wait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's
in no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code
that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,
or I can do it now when very few people can.

Not.Actually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.

I'm sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever.  Horses for
courses.

the check_local tarball includes a program called miltrassassin.
It's a C Milter program speaking the SPAMD protocol so it will be
far more efficient than spamass-milter.
Check http://www.digitalanswers.org/check_local/miltrassassin.html
for some details about miltrassassin.                                                                                                                                                                     
The check_local tarball can be downloaded on
http://www.digitalanswers.org/check_local/beta.htmlAnother alternative solution is to use Mimedefang : it offers
anti-spam, attachment defanging, custom filtering.regards, SL/---

"I have a situation with a small network as follows:A number of client workstations which are running VMware, each of which will
run a local copy of Samba (not the VMware autoinstalled version) to let
VMware access local linux disks.An NIS/NFS server which will also run Samba to allow the VMware clients
access to its filesystems.How can I set things up so that all the VMware clients (all running 'doze
98, possibly being upgraded in future to W2K) authenticate against the NIS
server's Samba ? I have read the Samab documentation in  large quantities
down through the years but as I've never wanted to do anything like this, I
never paid much attention to all the stuff about domain controllers etc.
which I presume is what I will need to have running here.I would also like, if at all possible, to have synchronisation of passwords
between the NIS domain and the NIS server's Samba with minimal manual
intervention.Ideas, accompanied by annotated Samba configration files :-) , gratefully
received.

"""the historical record"", by which you mean *human* historical record, is
highly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geological
timescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate.My problem with global warming (or cooling for that matter), is that the
supposedly profound recent changes in temperature, both in absolute
terms and as a function time, very arguably fall well below the noise
floor of the natural fluctuations that have occurred over the last
50,000 years both in terms of absolute average temperature and the rate
of temperature change.  People unfamiliar with history of global
temperature since the advent of modern humans may think that a degree
here or there over a century is a lot, not realizing that global
temperatures regularly whipsaw with far greater extremity.  I therefore 
immediately dismiss any theory of global warming that cannot explain why
temperatures whipsawed more severely in pre-history than in the last
couple thousand years (which have been relatively calm by geological
standards).  This is a very inconvenient fact for people trying to use
climate to push a particular social agenda.It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited
during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of
humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers
paved over their civilization.  The receding glaciers have turned into a
bit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buried
in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the
ice for thousands of years.  I don't see any compelling reason to ""save
the glaciers"" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their
existence has always been transient.For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are
anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  I'll
just stick with Occam's Razor for now.In my humble opinion.Cheers,-James Rogers

a friend of mine noted that the sounds produced tend to sound remarkably alike each other . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - short answer : in addition to various studies and papers there seems to be or to have been two major researchers in the area : felicitas goodman , and william samarin ; goodman using an anthropological method and samarin a linguistic one . they both published in the seventies . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - thanks to all who responded with comments , notes , references : rich alderson , keith allan , jeffrey howard allen , jose r . alvarez , susan burt , steve chandler , linda coleman , ellen contini - morava , alan davies , patricia donegan , brian drayton , sheila embleton , anthea f gupta , jacques guy , stephen helmreich , wayne leman , wenchao li , mark mitton , david l . moore , tim pulju , j . a . rea , malcolm ross , dale russell , deborah sweeney , shana walton , and some who preferred not to be named . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - list of references : i received the following references , most of which i have not yet dug out . goodman , felicitas ( 1969 ) . phonetic analysis of glossolalia in four cultural settings . journal for the scientific study of religion ( : 227-239 . goodman , felicitas ( 1972 ) . speaking in tongues . a cross - cultural study of glossolalia . the university of chicago press . samarin , william ( 1972a ) . tongues of men and angels . the religious language of pentecostalism . the macmillan company . samarin , william ( 1972b ) . variation and variables in religious glossolalia . language in society 1 : 121-130 . samarin , william ( 1973 ) . glossolalia as regressive speech . language and speech 16 : 77-89 . samarin , william ( 1974 ) . review of goodman ( 1972 ) . language 5 : 207-213 . malony h . n . & lovekin a . a . 1985 . glossolalia , new york , oxford university press . dilia flores . analisis y comparacian de hablas sagradas en tres formas de trance - posesian : un estudio en etnografia de la comunicacion . universidad del zulia , 1987 . a study of glossolalia and related phenomena in maracaibo , venezuela . _ tongue speaking _ , morton kelsey ( new york : crossroad , 1981 ) . _ they speak with other tongues _ , by john l . sherrill ( westwood , new jersey : fleming h . revell , 1964 ) , a popular treatment . _ the pentecostal movement in the catholic church _ by edward d . o'connor ( notre dame , indiana : ave maria press , 1971 ) claims cases of xenolalia ( speaking in an unlearned , existing language ) . and a recommendation to perform a library search for donald clarence laycock which might uncover a few things on glossolalia . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - fuller information , from the replies sent to me : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - basically , the finding was that the native language of the speaker was a pretty good predictor of the kinds of sounds that would occur in glossolalia ; one general pattern was that sounds perceived as generally marking "" foreign "" speech ( whatever that may mean ) would occur , while sounds perceived as typical of the native language would not . thus , for american english speakers , / r / would be rendered as the alveolar trill , never as the american retroflex ; on the other hand , these speakers would not include the low front vowel in their glossolalia , / ae / - as-digraph , because that 's perceived as a typically "" american "" sound for some reason . on the other hand , truly exotic sounds - - those not typical of the native language , but that do n't happen to be familiar to speakers of the language - - would tend not to occur : american english speakers do n't produce clicks in their glossolalia . and yes , the inventory of sounds is very simple and the sequence is repetitive . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - as a former church-goer myself who believed i had the ability to speak in tongues , i used to wonder a lot about the repetitive ( and ' primitive ' ? ) nature of the sounds that i produced and heard from others around , and also at the way people within a particular church tended to sound like one another ( but slightly different from people attending a different church ) . . . a case of unconscious ' copying ' ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i was told by one observer that i keep my british accent when i sing in tongues ; other people tell me this is not so . to my own ears , the sounds i produce are not like any language i know but they do occur in recurring patterns . i think they have predominantly l 's , s 's and vowels . the most articulate ( as distinct from hagiographic ) evaluation i received was that there are two continental charismatic traditions - a french one concentrating on melodious spontaneous song and a german / english one concentrating on speech . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i wanted to share my own experience : an old quaker minister ( from a very old-fashioned meeting which had come under the influence of pentecostalism ) came on a religious visit to our area and spent the night at our house . during a period of prayer in my living room , he spoke in tongues . i had never heard such a thing before , except in imitation , and i was impressed by the monotony of it . i can't make this machine do a phonetic transcription , but it was ( in a very quiet sing-song ) something like / ' a : ' tikari ' ka : ' tika ti ' ka : ti ' ka : / and then repeated ( the ' = primary stress ) . the shakers , a dying sect here known for their ecstatic group dancing and singing , incorporated "" tongues "" into many of their songs , in stylized form , and there were relatively few syllables used there as well - - ba , lo , ta , ti , ka , la and a few others . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - for a short answer , dredged out of my memory ( i wrote my undergraduate honors paper on this topic in 1973 ! ) : glossolalia is not a language , of course - - its users seem to latch onto and them repeat sounds that sound foreign to them , and intersperse the name jesus in between the sounds - - at least this was the case with glosslalia produced by american english speakers that i heard . jesus was pronounced , as i recall , as in english . many glossolalia users , however , think that they are speaking another human language , and will eagerly press this point to the visiting linguist , anthropologist or undergraduate . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - some years ago as an undergraduate , i memorized the first eleven lines to beowulf . occasionally i recited them to people ( i still do ) . once i recited them to a friend from alabama , and she told me that if i did that back where she came from , folks would say i was speaking in tongues . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - anecdotally , when i was an undergrad , one of my professors mentioned having seen a study or two on glossolalia . the studies indicated that the phoneme inventory was always quite small , smaller than that found in practically any natural language . maybe even smaller than the hawaiian inventory of thirteen phonemes , although my professor did n't go into details . my professor was a fundamentalist christian herself as well as an excellent linguist . she did believe that glossolalia was , at least in some cases , an inspired state and that people in that state were often speaking genuine languages . however , they were n't natural human languages . my professor pointed out that there was no reason to assume that they would be natural human languages , that people could speak in heavenly tongues which are meaningless to those on earth but which do have meaning , even if earthly people can't understand them . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - regards , and thanks j jussi karlgren jussi . karlgren @ sics . se sw inst of comp sc ( sics ) spr } kteknologi / natural language processing box 1263 , 164 28 kista ph + 46 8 752 15 00 , fax + 46 8 751 72 30 stockholm , sweden http : / / sics . se / ~ jussi / jussi-karlgren . html",Safe Email
